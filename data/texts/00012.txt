Vitamin A plays a critical role in fetal organogen-esis, and its severe deﬁciency during pregnancy is known to resultin malformations of several organs, including the kidney. How-ever, the consequences of mild vitamin A deﬁciency (VAD) hasreceived little attention. In the present study, we examined theeffect of in utero exposure to mild VAD on renal organogenesis.Methods. A rat model of mild VAD compatible with normal
gestation was developed. Plasma retinol was determined byreverse phase HPLC in mothers and fetuses. Nephron countingwas performed in kidneys of fetuses and pups issued from controland VAD mothers. Metanephroi explanted from 14-day-old fe-tuses from both groups were cultured in the presence or absenceof retinoic acid (RA), and growth and differentiation wereassessed. c-ret expression was analyzed from fetuses exposed inutero to VAD or to normal vitamin A status and also in meta-nephroi grown in culture with or without RA using RT-PCR.Results. The 50% reduction in circulating vitamin A levelsinduced by vitamin A deprivation in pregnant rats did not affectthe overall fetal development. However, the number of nephronswas reduced by 20% in 21-day-old VAD fetuses. The number ofnephrons was closely correlated with circulating vitamin A level inboth VAD and control fetuses. Metanephroi taken from VADfetuses developed to a lesser extent in vitro , but their capacity to
respond to exogenous retinoic acid was not altered. Finally, wefound that the expression of the proto-oncogene c-ret was mod-ulated according to the retinoid environment.Conclusion. We conclude that vitamin A supply to the fetus iscritical in determining the number of nephrons. Data availablethus far on the frequency of mild VAD during pregnancy and onthe long-term consequences of inborn nephron deﬁcit highlightthe clinical relevance of the present study.Vitamin A deﬁciency (VAD) is a massive public healthproblem, mostly in developing countries where it is oftenpart of complex nutritional deﬁciencies [1–3]. An insufﬁ-
cient vitamin A supply for basic needs may also be relatedto dietary habits, whatever the caloric intake, and tononcontrolled weight-reducing diets [1]. Finally, low circu-lating levels of retinol and RBP have been reported inpatients with liver disease, gastrointestinal disorders orchronic alcoholism [4–6]. Whatever the origin of vitamin Adeﬁciency, women of child-bearing age are particularly atrisk because of the extra requirements of this nutrient
during pregnancy and lactation [7, 8]. Due to the essentialrole of vitamin A and its metabolites during prenataldevelopment, vitamin A status is critical for the fetus[9–12]. This is also the time point in life during that a deﬁcitis the most likely to occur, since in addition to a possiblevitamin A deﬁciency in the mother, any reduction in theplacental blood ﬂow, irrespective of the mother’s status,will reduce the supply of vitamin A to the fetus. It has beenrecognized for decades that severe maternal vitamin Adeﬁciency results in fetal death or major congenital mal-formations in the offspring [13, 14]. By contrast, theconsequences of mild vitamin A deﬁciency during preg-nancy have received little attention because the resultingnewborns are apparently normal [8, 15]. Nevertheless, amild vitamin A deﬁciency may cause clinically silent defectsin organogenesis that are not recognized at birth, but mayinduce long-term functional consequences. Since vitamin Aand retinoic acid have recently
Since vitamin Aand retinoic acid have recently been reported to be keydeterminants in the control of nephron number in ratmetanephric organ cultures [16], the kidney appears as oneof the organs whose development might be impaired by aninsufﬁcient vitamin A supply.
In the current study we examined the renal developmentin a rat model of in utero exposure to a mild vitamin Adeﬁciency, allowing an overall normal development tooccur. We found that a reduction of circulating vitamin Ain the mother induced a nephron deﬁcit in the fetus. Thenumber of nephrons was strictly correlated to circulatinglevels of vitamin A. We also found that expression of theprotooncogene c-ret, which was recently reported to playKey words: vitamin A in pregnancy, retinoic acid, metanephros, nephronnumber, c-ret proto-oncogene.Received for publication February 24, 1998and in revised form June 2, 1998Accepted for publication June 2, 1998© 1998 by the International Society of NephrologyKidney International, Vol. 54 (1998), pp. 1455–14621455
an essential role in renal organogenesis [17], was modu-lated by retinoid environment, thus indicating that thecontrol of nephron mass by vitamin A might be partlymediated by the tyrosine kinase receptor Ret. The clinicalimplication of these studies is highlighted by recent obser-vations that inborn nephron deﬁcit, even a moderatedeﬁcit, represents a potential risk factor for the progressionin patients with chronic renal disease [18–20]. Further-more, some have also suggested that a reduced number ofnephrons favors the development of hypertension [18].METHODSAnimalsFemale Sprague-Dawley rats aged 30 days (weightaround 100 g) were assigned to two groups. The controlgroup received the standard chow for pregnant and lactat-ing rats (19,800 IU/kg vitamin A). Animals of the vitaminA-deﬁcient group (VAD) were fed the same diet with novitamin A (100 6100 IU/kg). Both diets were purchased
from UAR Laboratory (Villemoison sur Orge, France).The females were maintained on their respective diets forthree weeks before mating. They were then housed withmales overnight and those having vaginal smears containingspermatozoids the following day were housed separately;this day was considered to be day 0 of gestation. The twodiets were maintained until the day of experiment. Bodyweight was recorded three times a week.Experimental designSix pregnant females of the VAD group and ﬁve from
the control group were used on day 21 of gestation. Theywere weighed and anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital(5 mg/100 g body wt), and the fetuses were delivered bycaesarian section. Four fetuses were randomly taken,weighed, and their blood collected from axillary vessels forplasma retinol assay. The left kidney was removed, weighedand prepared for nephron counting. Blood samples weretaken from the mothers before sacriﬁce for plasma retinoldetermination. In three other females of each group,fetuses were used on day 15 of gestation and metanephroicollected for analysis of c-ret expression. Eight pregnantfemales of each group were allowed to deliver spontane-ously, and the pups weighed four hours later. The litterswere reduced to eight pups taken at random. All the pupswere weighed on postnatal days 7 and 14. Four pups wererandomly taken from each litter on day 14 and used forplasma retinol determination and nephron counting. Twoadditional pregnant females of the control group
pregnant females of the control group weregiven a subcutaneous injection of 20 mg/kg of retinoic acidin peanut oil, on day 11 of gestation. The number ofnephrons was determined in four 14-day-old pups of eachlitter and compared to the nephron number present in pupsborn to two other control mothers injected with peanut oil.Control and VAD females were also used for in vitro
experiments using metanephric organ culture. Six pregnantfemales of each group were anesthetized on day 14 ofgestation, fetuses were aseptically removed and meta-nephroi collected for culture. After six days of culture inthe presence or absence of retinoic acid, they were pre-pared either for glomerular labeling and protein assay, orfor analysis of c-ret expression.Metanephric organ cultureMetanephric organ culture was performed as previouslydescribed [21, 22]. Brieﬂy, the metanephroi explanted from14-day-old fetuses were placed onto a 0.8mm polycarbon-ate ﬁlter (Millipore, Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France),ﬂoating on a deﬁned serum-free medium and incubated forsix days in 35 mm Petri dishes at 37 60.5°C in a humidiﬁedincubator with 5% CO2. Deﬁned medium was DMEM/Ham’s F12 (vol/vol) supplemented with HEPES (15 m M),sodium bicarbonate (45 m M, pH 7.45), transferrin (6.2 31028M), selenium (6.8 31029M), insulin (8.3 31027M),
triiodothyronine (2 31029M) and prostaglandin E1 (7 31028M). All reagents were purchased from Sigma (Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France). This medium is well suited formetanephros differentiation [22].A stock solution of all-trans -retinoic acid 10 mMwasprepared in absolute ethanol and stored at 220°C in the
A stock solution of all-trans -retinoic acid 10 mMwasprepared in absolute ethanol and stored at 220°C in thedark. It was used in the culture medium at a 100 nanomolarconcentration. For each fetus, one kidney was grown incontrol medium, and the other in the retinoic acid supple-mented medium.Nephron mass determination in the entire kidneyThe number of nephrons was determined in kidneys of21-day-old fetuses and 14-day-old pups by the method ofDamadian, Shawayri and Bricker [23] adapted for imma-ture kidneys [24]. Whole kidneys were incubated in 50%hydrochloric acid for 10 to 50 minutes at 37°C, the incuba-tion time being dependent on the kidney weight. Kidneyswere rinsed with tap water and stored overnight at 4°C in agauged ﬂask. Following mechanical dissociation, tubulesand glomeruli were suspended in water. Three aliquots ofknown volume were used for counting the glomeruli bythree investigators unaware of the specimen origin.Nephron counting and growth assessment in
Nephron counting and growth assessment inmetanephric organ cultureNephrons formed in vitro can be counted after labeling ofall the glomeruli present in the explanted metanephroiafter six days of culture, using speciﬁc lectin-binding siteslocated on the external membranes of the podocytes asdescribed previously [25]. Brieﬂy, after ﬁxation with 2%paraformaldehyde in PBS, the explanted metanephroi weredetached from the ﬁlter, permeabilized with saponin, andlabeled with rhodamin-coupled peanut agglutinin. Count-ing was performed independently by two investigators usingLelie`vre-Pe ´gorier et al: Vitamin A and nephrogenesis 1456
an Optiphot microscope (Nikon, Champigny, France). Af-ter counting, growth of the explanted metanephroi wasdetermined by their protein content. The labeled meta-nephroi were rinsed in distilled water and sonicated for 15seconds in individual tubes containing 0.5 ml of distilledwater. Protein content was measured in duplicate, accord-ing to Lowry et al’s procedure [26] modiﬁed by Larson,Howlett and Jagendorf [27], using bovine serum albumin asstandard.Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysisc-ret expression was analyzed in metanephroi from 15-day-old embryos exposed in utero to VAD or to normalvitamin A status, and also in metanephroi taken from14-day-old control embryos and grown for six days underpaired conditions, that is, in the presence or absence ofretinoic acid (100 nM). Messenger RNAs were extracted
M). Messenger RNAs were extractedand pooled from at least eight metanephroi, using Dyna-beads mRNA puriﬁcation kit (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). Fol-lowing reverse-transcription according to Kinoshita et al[28], ampliﬁcation for c-ret was performed based on thenucleotide sequence Genbank X67812, using the followingprimers: (S), 5 9-GCGCCCCGAGTG TGAGGAAT-GTGG-3 9, and (AS), 5 9GCTGATGCAATGGGCGGCT-TGTGC-3 9, leading to a PCR product size of 442 bp.Primers forb-actin were used as an internal control tonormalize for c-ret expression and were: (S), 5 9-AA-GAGAGGCATCCTGACCCT-3 9, and (AS), 5 9-GGC-CATCTCTTGCTCGAAGT-3 9, with a predicted productsize of 504 bp. The reaction mixture was subjected to 30cycles of ampliﬁcation in a thermal cycler (AppligeneOncor, Illkirch, France) using 200mMof each dNTP and
mMof each dNTP and0.75 U Pro-HA DNA polymerase (Eurogentec, Seraing,Belgium). Each cycle consisted of a heat-denaturation stepat 95°C for one minute, annealing of primers at 63°C forone minute, and polymerization at 72°C for one minute. Toperform relative quantiﬁcation of gene expression as pro-posed by Kinoshita et al [28], c-ret andb-actin mRNAswere ampliﬁed as follows: ﬁrst, primers for c-ret mRNAsequence were added to the reaction mixture; then after 5cycles of ampliﬁcation, primers forb-actin were added for25 additional cycles. The PCR products were visualized byUV transillumination and photographed using 667 Po-laroid ﬁlms. Bands densitometry was performed usingimage analysis software (NIH Image).Plasma retinol determinationPlasma vitamin A concentration was determined by
Plasma vitamin A concentration was determined byreversed phase HPLC [29]. Brieﬂy, samples were mixedwith an ethanol-solution. Two milliliters of n-hexane/buty-lated hydroxytoluene were added for vitamin A extraction,and the n-hexane phase was removed by evaporation undernitrogen. The residue was dissolved in 200ml of the mobilephase methanol/dichloromethane 65/35, and 150 ml wereinjected into a HPLC pump (Waters, Saint-Quentin enYvelines, France) linked to a multiwave length detector.Detection was performed at 325 nm at a ﬂow rate of 2ml/min. Separation was performed on a nucleosil C-18column with a precolumn module (Life Science Interna-tional, Cergy Pontoise, France). Retinol was used as exter-nal standard and retinol laurate as internal standard. Allreagents were of ultrapure grade (Sigma, Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France).StatisticsAll values are expressed as means 6SEM. Control andVAD data were compared by Mann-Whitney U-test. The
Wilcoxon’s test was used for comparison of paired in vitrodata. Signiﬁcance was determined by P,0.05. The rela-tionship between two parameters was calculated by deter-mining Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient.RESULTSIn vivo experimentsThe body growth of VAD and control females beforemating were similar (112 65 g weight gain vs. 109 68g ,N55 and 6, respectively). Fertility rates were 88 and87.5%, respectively. Maternal growth during pregnancy wasregular in both groups, resulting in a similar weight gain(172 610 g, N55, vs. 170 615 g, N56, respectively).Plasma retinol concentration measured on day 21 of ges-tation was decreased by approximately 50% in VAD fe-males (14.6 61.1
Plasma retinol concentration measured on day 21 of ges-tation was decreased by approximately 50% in VAD fe-males (14.6 61.1mg/dl, N55) as compared to controls(30.5 62.8mg/dl, N56,P,0.001).The same number of fetuses was found in VAD andcontrol mothers (11.9 60.6 and 12.8 60.7, respectively).No obvious developmental defect was observed in any ofthe 21-day-old fetuses from either group. Plasma retinolconcentration in the fetus correlated to that of the mother(Fig. 1). As reported in Table 1, plasma retinol concentra-tion in the VAD fetuses was reduced by about 50% onaverage. There was no delay in body or kidney growth.However, the mean number of nephrons was reduced by20%. When VAD and control data were plotted together,the number of nephrons signiﬁcantly correlated to plasmaretinol (Fig. 2). It also correlated for each group takenseparately ( r50.54, N520,P,0.05, for the VAD group;r50.51, N524,P,0.01, for controls). In VAD females
allowed to deliver spontaneously, the duration of preg-nancy was normal. As shown in Table 2, the mean birthweight of pups born to VAD mothers did not differsigniﬁcantly from that of pups born to control mothers. Thesame held true for body wt on day 7 after birth, that is threeto four days after nephron induction was completed [30].The ﬁnal number of nephrons counted in 14-day-old pupswas reduced by 20%, that is, in the same proportion as thenumber counted in 21-day-old fetuses. Pups, already deﬁ-cient in vitamin A at birth and breast fed by mothersmaintained on a VAD diet, had a very low plasma retinolLelie`vre-Pe ´gorier et al: Vitamin A and nephrogenesis 1457
concentration (4.2 60.8mg/dl) compared with pups of thecontrol group (26.0 61.9mg/dl). As expected, they, hadreduced body and kidney weights.Pups born to mothers injected with retinoic acid on day11 of gestation appeared normal at birth. As shown inTable 3, the mean birth weight was similar to that of controlpups. Body and kidney weights on postnatal day 14 werelower. However, the mean number of nephrons was in-creased by 21% compared to controls.In vitro experimentsAt the time of fetal kidney collection (embryonic day 14),the maternal plasma retinol concentration was about 50%lower in VAD females (12.2 62.2mg/dl, N56) than incontrol females (26.0 60.6;N56,P,0.001). The meanbody wt of embryos issued from both groups did not differ.Metanephroi explanted from VAD embryos and culturedin vitro for six days are shown on the Figure 3 and thequantiﬁcation of growth and differentiation parameters onFigure 4. Despite identical culture conditions, the mean
protein content of metanephroi was decreased by 40%, andthe mean glomerular number by 30%. It is worthwhile tonote that the lower the maternal plasma retinol concentra-tion, the fewer the nephrons formed in vitro (r50.883, N58,P,0.001). In the presence of 100 nMof retinoic acid inthe culture medium, the metanephric growth and differen-tiation were markedly stimulated in both groups, butproportionally more for the metanephroi explanted fromFig. 1.

The presence of retinoicacid 100 nMin the culture medium for six days induced asevenfold increase in c-ret mRNAs.DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrates for the ﬁrst time thatmild vitamin A deﬁciency during gestation alters nephro-genesis and results in a permanent nephron deﬁcit. Prior tothis study, only severe vitamin A deﬁciencies or excess ofvitamin A have been considered as a risk factor for thefetus. The present study also demonstrates that nephron
number in the fetus is linearly correlated with circulatingvitamin A levels. The correlation was found even foranimals in the control group.In previous animal studies, severe vitamin A deﬁciencyduring gestation resulted in multiple malformations in theFig. 3.

fetus, with fetal growth retardation or death [13, 14]. In
these studies, the animals had been placed for two or threemonths before mating, onto a diet containing enoughcarotene for growth but not for appreciable storage ofvitamin A. They were then transferred onto a diet com-pletely free of carotene and vitamin A, which was main-tained throughout pregnancy. Since hepatic stores of vita-min A take seven to eight weeks to be entirely consumed[31], circulating vitamin A in the mother and in the fetus,although not determined, was likely to be undetectablewithin a few days, thus explaining the severe developmentaldefects that were observed. Our goal, by contrast, was toachieve a moderate decrease in circulating vitamin A todetermine whether it would inﬂuence renal developmentwithout leading to either prenatal fatalities or globalgrowth retardation. We therefore deprived female ratsfrom vitamin A for a total of only six weeks, including theduration of gestation, in order to avoid hepatic storeexhaustion. This led to about a two times reduction
This led to about a two times reduction ofplasma vitamin A at term, and even two weeks after birth,plasma vitamin A levels, although very low, were stillmeasurable in pups born to VAD mothers.
Vitamin A is transported from the mother to the fetusbound to retinol binding protein [32]. In the present study,fetal plasma retinol variations followed maternal plasmaretinol variations. However, the mean plasma retinol con-centration in the fetus was about 15% lower than that in themother. Of interest is the fact that the difference betweenmaternal and fetal plasma retinol was reported to behigher, around 50%, during normal human pregnancy. Thismay partly explain why the frequency of inadequate vitaminA levels was found to be higher in fetuses than in theirmothers [15, 33].Pups born to VAD mothers had a reduced number of
Pups born to VAD mothers had a reduced number ofnephrons. This number is clearly inappropriate for a birthbody weight as compared to controls. In pups maintainedwith VAD mothers during lactation, the body weight was,as expected, found to be reduced on day 14, leading to anumber of nephrons per body weight ratio similar to that ofcontrol pups. However, as observed in littermates weanedon standard diet, total catch-up of growth retardationoccurred within two weeks (body wt on day 14 after birth,30.1 60.9 vs. 29.7 61.3 g in control and VAD ratsrespectively, N532 in each group). These pups willtherefore have an inappropriate number of nephrons fortheir body weight.A permanent nephron deﬁcit has been found in humans
and animals with intra-uterine growth retardation [34–37].In the present study, however, pups born to VAD mothershad impaired nephrogenesis, but normal birth weights.Fetal growth retardation is often related to placental bloodﬂow disturbances. We therefore suggest that nephrondeﬁcit of growth retardation results from a low vitamin Asupply to the fetus. It has indeed been reported thatvitamin A and retinol binding protein plasma concentra-tions, and liver stores of vitamin A are low in growthretarded newborn infants [38, 39].The complete spectrum of congenital abnormalities in
severe vitamin A deﬁciency is also present in doublemutant mice for speciﬁc combinations of retinoic acidnuclear receptors [40, 41]. Thus, the developmental defectsfollowing severe vitamin A deﬁciency is likely to result fromreduced retinoic acid content. Retinoic acid may also beinvolved in renal phenotype of mild vitamin A deﬁciency,since we found that a single injection of retinoic acid to themother was able to increase nephrogenesis in the fetus. It isalso suggested that the content of endogenous retinoic acidwas diminished in the metanephroi of vitamin A deﬁcientfetuses that developed in vitro to a lower extent. However,
the capacity of these metanephroi to respond to exogenousretinoic acid was not altered. These data are consistent withour previous data reporting that retinoic acid controlled thenumber of nephrons formed in metanephric organ culturein a dose dependent manner [16].Nephron formation in the metanephric mesenchyme isinduced by the tips of the growing branches of the uretericbud [42]. As a consequence, nephron number depends onthe branching capacity of the ureteric bud. We previouslyreported that retinoic acid stimulates in vitro nephrogenesisthrough an effect on the ureteric bud branching morpho-genesis [16]. Consistently, nephron deﬁcits were found inthe present study to be proportionally the same in 21-day-old fetuses and in 14-day-old pups, which can be explainedby the fact that the ureteric bud no longer branches duringlate nephrogenesis [43]. No additional deﬁcit could thus beFig. 5. Product analysis of RT-PCR for c-ret mRNA. (A) Metanephroi

induced by vitamin A deﬁciency. We therefore propose thatretinoic acid controls branching morphogenesis of theureteric bud in vivo as it does in vitro .From a molecular point of view, one likely candidate to
mediate the vitamin A-dependent renal organogenesis isthe ret protooncogene, as already proposed [16]. It hasbeen reported that its product, a receptor tyrosine kinase, isexpressed in the metanephros and is restricted to the tips ofthe ureteric bud [44]. The role of c-ret in kidney formationis crucial, since null mice for this gene exhibit renal agenesisor have rudimentary kidneys due to failure of the uretericbud to develop [17]. In the present study we found thatc-ret expression was modulated according to the retinoidenvironment. This is consistent with previous report show-ing that c-ret expression can be induced during neuronaldifferentiation upon retinoic acid exposure [45]. Thus far,no retinoic acid response element has been found withinthe c-ret promoter [46]. However, retinoic acid nuclearreceptors (RAR) are likely to control the c-ret expressionthat we observed, since renal agenesis or hypoplasia werefound in both c-ret null mice and RAR double mutant mice[17, 40].
Finally, our results demonstrate that fetal nephron num-ber strictly correlates to the vitamin A circulating level.This highlights the fact that nephron number is highlydependent on both the placental blood ﬂow and the vitaminA status of the mother. This ﬁnding may explain the largevariation in the number of nephrons found in otherwisehealthy human populations [36, 47–49]. Due to alimentaryhabits, inadequate intakes of vitamin A may be a commonfeature, even in developed countries, and in some womenthe resulting low vitamin A stores may not be sufﬁcient tomeet increased demands during pregnancy [7, 8, 15, 50, 51].A relatively large population of apparently normal new-borns may therefore have had altered nephrogenesis, lead-ing to permanent nephron deﬁcit with possible long-termclinical consequences.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was presented as oral communication at the 30th Annual
