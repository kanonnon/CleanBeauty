Karger AG, Basel  Introduction  The skin is continuously exposed to harmful environ-ments which cause various adverse effects on the struc-ture and function of the skin. Among those environmen-tal influences, solar UV radiation is of considerable im-portance in the pathobiochemistry of specific types of skin cancer, premature aging of the skin, photosensitiv-ity disorders and sunburn  [1] . Solar UV radiation is sub-
[1] . Solar UV radiation is sub-divided into UVA (320–400 nm), UVB (290–320 nm) and UVC ( ! 290 nm)  [2] . The ozone layer efficiently absorbs UVC so that the wavelengths of solar UV radiation that damage the skin are UVA and UVB. UVA penetrates into the deeper layer of the skin where it breaks up the elastin and collagen fibers, causing premature photoaging of the skin. UVB radiation is 1,000 times more genotoxic and strongly absorbed by DNA, causing sunburn and skin cancer  [3, 4]  .

Jeon/Kim/Kim/Lee Skin Pharmacol Physiol 2009;22:137–141 138  The conventional sun-protective behavior is applying a sunscreen to the skin. Sunscreens contain chemicals that absorb UV rays, thereby protecting the skin  [5] . Since sunscreens can be removed by perspiring or swimming, for best results, a sunscreen should be applied 30–60 min before venturing into the sun. Although sunscreen use is still the first -line strategy of preventing UV damage to the skin, it is helpful in avoiding photodamage only to a certain extent.  Oral supplementation has gained considerable atten-
tion for protecting the skin from a harmful environment such as sunlight and pollutants and restoring it. In view of the growing interest in systemic photoprotection, many compounds have been assessed for their ability to provide photoprotection after oral administration. Since reactive oxygen species formed upon solar radiation play a central role in initiating and driving the detrimental signaling events, antioxidant supplementation is thought to provide a photoprotective effect against UV radiation  [6] . Dietary botanical agents, which possess anti-inflam-matory, immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties, are among the most promising groups of compounds that can attenuate the adverse effects of overexposure to UV radiation  [7] .  The present study was designed to test whether epigal-
locatechin gallate (EGCG) supplementation has a protec-tive effect against UV radiation. EGCG is a powerful an-tioxidant thought to be responsible for the significant benefits of green tea on skin. Studies have recently shown that oral administration of green tea polyphenols in the drinking water of mice results in significant protection against UV-induced damage and photocarcinogenesis. The photoprotective effect of green tea polyphenols is mediated by inhibition of UV-induced immunosuppres-sion through a cytokine interleukin-12-dependent DNA repair mechanism  [8, 9]  . Moreover, oral administration green tea polyphenols also inhibit UVB-induced oxida-tive damage and expression of matrix metalloproteinases  [10] . Since EGCG comprises approximately 59% of the total of catechins and is assumed to be the source of most of the biological activity of tea, oral administration of EGCG may provide a promising strategy to counteract solar UV radiation  [11, 12]  .
[11, 12]  .  Materials and Methods  Materials  EGCG ( 1 94%) was obtained from DSM Ltd. All other chem-i c a l s  w e r e  a v a i l a b l e  p r o d u c t s  o f  a n a l y t i c a l  g r a d e  o r  H P L C  grade.  A n i m a l s   Female HWY/Slc hairless rats (9 weeks old) weighing 190–210 g were obtained from SLC Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). The animals were acclimatized for 1 week in the animal facility prior to the experiments and housed under controlled conditions. All care and treatment of rats were in compliance with the guide for care and use of laboratory animals and local institutional guidelines.  E x p e r i m e n t a l  D e s i g n   Twenty-five female HWY/Slc hairless rats were randomly di-
vided into 5 groups: 2 groups, normal control and EGCG-treated group, for minimal erythema dose (MED) measurement and 3 groups, nonirradiated control, UV-irradiated control and UV-irradiated+EGCG-treated group, for the assessment of UV-in-duced skin damage. Each group of 5 rats was housed in a cage.  The rats of the UV-irradiated group were exposed to UVB lamps (Waldmann UV800; Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany; 285–350 nm, peak at 310–315 nm) 3 times a week. The intensity of irradiation was gradually increased from 97 mJ/cm 2  (equiva-lent to 1 MED) to 194 mJ/cm 2  (equivalent to 2 MED) to achieve the total dose of 3,492 mJ/cm 2  (equivalent to 36 MED) over the 8
2  (equiva-lent to 1 MED) to 194 mJ/cm 2  (equivalent to 2 MED) to achieve the total dose of 3,492 mJ/cm 2  (equivalent to 36 MED) over the 8 weeks. The normal, nonirradiated and UV-irradiated control groups were fed a commercial rat food that contained protein (ap-prox. 20%) and fat (approx. 7%). The EGCG-treated groups were fed the normal diet supplemented with 1,500 ppm EGCG (Feed-lab Korea Corp., Seoul, Korea). Food and water were provided ad libitum. Food consumption and body weight were recorded dur-ing the experimental period.   M E D  M e a s u r e m e n t   After 8 weeks of supplementation with EGCG, the MED was determined visually by using 12 incremental exposures of 51.7–194.0 mJ/cm 2 . The lowest dose causing a sharply circumscribed homogenous erythema 24 h after UVB exposure was defined as the MED.  UV-Induced Skin Damage Assessment    Visual Score Assessment.   Visual scoring of skin condition was
performed to evaluate the skin condition. The visual score was recorded by one investigator who had been trained in its use in a series of pilot tests with the consultant dermatologist. The extent of skin scaling and damage was scored according to a scale rang-ing from 0 to 5, with 0 representing normal skin and 5 represent-ing extensive cracking with widespread reddening or occasional bleeding.   Transepidermal Water Loss.   Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured as a marker of epidermal barrier function using a wireless vapometer (Delfin Technologies Ltd., Kuopio, Finland). The measurement was carried out 48 h after the final irradiation to allow a recovery from the acute UV effect.  Statistical Analysis  The results are presented as means  8  SD. Statistical analysis
was performed using the SPSS program (SPSS 12.0). MED and TEWL data were analyzed by t test and one- way ANO V A with Duncan’s multiple range tests, respectively. Nonparametric data and visual scores were analyzed by the Friedman repeated mea-sures test with ANOVA on ranks.Downloaded from http://karger.com/spp/article-pdf/22/3/137/3544559/000201562.pdf by Keio University user on 26 September 2024
Oral EGCG Supplementation, MED and UV-Induced Skin Damage Skin Pharmacol Physiol 2009;22:137–141 139  Results and Discussion  MED Measurement  Erythema dose responses are displayed in  figure 1 . The normal-diet group showed MEDs ranging from 90.5 to 103.5 mJ/cm 2 , with a mean value of 99.2 mJ/cm 2 . A sig-nificant (p  !  0.01) increase was observed after supple-mentation of EGCG for 8 weeks; the MED ranged from 129.3 to 155.2 mJ/cm 2 , with a mean value of 144.9 mJ/cm 2  ( fig. 1 ).

Jeon/Kim/Kim/Lee Skin Pharmacol Physiol 2009;22:137–141 140showed no distinct histological differences other than epidermal thickening in UV-irradiated controls (data not shown). This observation is consistent with results of pre-vious studies in which UV irradiation induced a progres-sive thickening of the epidermis  [14] . Even though mor-phological changes showed little similarity to human sunburn, these experimental results can be transposed to humans.  The amount of EGCG given to the animals was rough-ly equal to about one third to one cup of green tea per day  [15] . Although the dosage of EGCG used in this study is
too high to be physiologically relevant, this result indi-cates that several cups of green tea a day may help sustain the skin’s natural ability to deal with UV-radiation-re-lated effects and aging. However, some discouraging and unexpected side effects were often observed in the case of the application of antioxidant supplements. There are several possible explanations for these contradictory findings. Extra antioxidants may interfere with some es-sential defensive mechanism by eliminating free radicals. Also, the human population is heterogeneous and the di-versity of initial antioxidant levels is hardly exceptional  [16, 17]  . Nevertheless, there are some clear tendencies concerning the systemic application of EGCG. Taking into consideration all the available literature and the re-sults of the present study, EGCG is a potent antioxidant that works as an oral photoprotector.  Conclusions  In conclusion, the present study shows that the regular
intake of EGCG markedly increases the MED and thus strengthens the skin’s tolerance to the UV radiation. The conclusion is supported by the observation that EGCG supplementation attenuated the UV-induced perturba-tion of epidermal barrier function and skin damage. EGCG, with its demonstrated efficacy to protect the skin from solar UV radiation, is an ideal candidate as a prod-uct for systemic photoprotection. However, long-term studies using a low dose are required to provide addition-al supportive evidence. Nevertheless, this study serves as a good point of departure to accelerate the development of new photoprotective strategies based on the endoge-nous protective response to UV light.   Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL)  UVB irradiation markedly increased TEWL to 16.1  8  1.9 g/m 2 /h when compared to the normal control, 12.8  8  0.8 g/m 2 /h; however, the EGCG-treated group remained at a control level of 12.7  8  0.8 g/m 2 /h ( fig. 3 ). No adverse
effect was observed during the study period.  The present results show the significant increase in MED by the supplementation of EGCG. The MED is a measure of the ability of a sunscreen to protect against erythema, which is thus primarily a measure of UV pro-tection. This suggests that EGCG supplementation in-creases the MED which might indicate a consequent re-duced risk for UV-induced skin damage. Oral EGCG, with its strong antioxidant capacity, provides a strategy to combat the excess generation of reactive oxygen spe-cies in response to UV radiation and hence strengthens the skin’s defense capacity against UV radiation  [10] . Al-though sunscreen use is a valuable method of sun protec-tion, it cannot completely block the UV rays. Besides, some body areas are frequently missing when applying the sunscreen  [13] . Oral sunscreens can improve the cur-rently used means of photoprotection.   W e  a l s o  o b s e r v e d  t h a t  E G C G  c o n s u m p t i o n  s i g n i f i -
