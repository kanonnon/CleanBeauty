Both 25 dihydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) 2D] and its active hormonal form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH) 2D] areessential for human physiological functions, including damping down inﬂammation and the excessiveintracellular oxidative stresses. Vitamin D is one of the key controllers of systemic inﬂammation,
oxidative stress and mitochondrial respiratory function, and thus, the aging process in humans.In turn, molecular and cellular actions form 1,25(OH) 2D slow down oxidative stress, cell and tissuedamage, and the aging process. On the other hand, hypovitaminosis D impairs mitochondrialfunctions, and enhances oxidative stress and systemic inﬂammation. The interaction of 1,25(OH) 2Dwith its intracellular receptors modulates vitamin D–dependent gene transcription and activationof vitamin D-responsive elements, which triggers multiple second messenger systems. Thus, it isnot surprising that hypovitaminosis D increases the incidence and severity of several age-relatedcommon diseases, such as metabolic disorders that are linked to oxidative stress. These includeobesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, pregnancy complications, memory disorders,osteoporosis, autoimmune diseases, certain cancers, and systemic inﬂammatory diseases. Vitamin D
adequacy leads to less oxidative stress and improves mitochondrial and endocrine functions, reducingthe risks of disorders, such as autoimmunity, infections, metabolic derangements, and impairmentof DNA repair; all of this aids a healthy, graceful aging process. Vitamin D is also a potentanti-oxidant that facilitates balanced mitochondrial activities, preventing oxidative stress-relatedprotein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage. New understandings of vitamin D-relatedadvances in metabolomics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, in relation to its ability to control oxidativestress in conjunction with micronutrients, vitamins, and antioxidants, following normalization ofserum 25(OH)D and tissue 1,25(OH) 2D concentrations, likely to promise cost-e ﬀective better clinicaloutcomes in humans.Keywords: 25(OH)D; 1,25(OH) 2D; aging; cytokines; inﬂammation; morbidity and mortality;prevention; reactive oxygen species; ultraviolet1. Introduction
1. IntroductionVitamin D is a micronutrient that is metabolized into a multifunctional secosteroid hormone thatis essential for human health. Globally, its deﬁciency is a major public health problem a ﬀecting allages and ethnic groups; it has surpassed iron deﬁciency as the most common nutritional deﬁciencyin the world. The increasing prevalence of vitamin D deﬁciency and its associated complications areprominent in countries furthest from the equator. However, incidence is also high among those wholive within 1,000 km of the equator (e.g., in Sri Lanka, India, and Far Eastern, Middle Eastern, CentralAmerican, and Persian Gulf countries) because of a combination of climatic conditions, ethnic andcultural habits, and having darker skin color [1–4].Biology 2019 ,8, 30; doi:10.3390 /biology8020030 www.mdpi.com /journal /biology
Biology 2019 ,8, 30 2 of 15Most of the vitamin D the human body requires can be generated by an individual’s exposureto summer-like sunlight, with dietary sources playing a supporting role when sunlight exposure islimited or ine ﬀective for vitamin D production. Despite the above, more than 50% of the population inthe group of countries mentioned has vitamin D deﬁciency [ 5,6]. If e ﬀective public health guidelinesare implemented, vitamin D deﬁciency can be easily and cost-e ﬀectively treated and prevented, savingmillions of dollars and lives. Although excessive sun exposure does not cause hypervitaminosis D,it can cause other harm because of dermal cell DNA damage [ 7–9]. Thus, guidelines for safe sunexposure are needed for each country.During the past decade, many advances in the understanding of the physiology and biologyof vitamin D and its receptor ecology have emerged [ 10]. Vitamin D metabolism and functions are
modulated by many factors. Accumulating evidence supports biological associations of vitamin D withdisease risk reduction and improved physical and mental functions. The ﬁeld is rapidly advancing,including the knowledge of the physiology of vitamin D-vitamin D receptor (VDR) interactions and thebiology and metabolism of vitamin D and their e ﬀects on vitamin D axis and gene polymorphisms [ 11].Together these data have facilitated our understanding of new pathways to intervene to prevent andtreat human diseases.However, what is lacking is the adequately powered, conducted for su ﬃcient duration,well-designed randomized controlled clinical studies (RCTs) conducted in an unbiased mannerwith the nutrient vitamin D as the key intervention and having predeﬁned hard endpoints /primaryoutcomes [ 12]. Moreover, such studies must recruit persons with vitamin D deﬁciency [i.e., serum25(OH)D concentrations less than 20 ng /mL (50 nmol /L)] and achieve a pre-determined target serum
25(OH)D concentration through daily oral administration and /or safe exposure to ultraviolet rays; notmerely by relying on oral administered doses. The goal of this review is to explore the e ﬀects fromvitamin D-modulated gene interactions and the e ﬀects of hypovitaminosis-induced, mitochondria-basedoxidative stress on aging.1.1. Extrarenal Generation of 1,25(OH) 2DThe active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH) 2D], is generated not onlyin renal tubular cells (endocrine functions as a hormone) but also in extrarenal target tissue cells,providing autocrine and paracrine functions. However, because it remains within the target tissuecells, the intra-cellular concentrations achieved are unclear. In addition, the catabolic activity of24-hydroxylase in target tissues plays an important part in regulating both 25-hydroxy vitamin D[25(OH)D; calcidiol], and 1,25(OH) 2D (calcitriol) concentrations and their availability.
The amounts of 1,25(OH) 2D generated in renal tubules and target cells can vary from person toperson and day to day and are hard to quantify. Although the calcitriol in the circulation is modulatedby parathyroid hormone (PTH) and serum ionized calcium concentrations [ 13], the intracellular contentis regulated largely through serum 25(OH)D availability and calcidiol and calcitriol catabolism throughhydroxylation at the molecular positions C-24 and C-23 by a speciﬁc 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) [14].1.2. Excess Sun Exposure Does Not Cause Hypervitaminosis DAfter exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) rays, dermal cells actively synthesize vitamin D. As afeedback mechanism, excess precursors produced are catabolized within the dermal cells by thesame UVB rays. In addition, skin also contains the inactivating enzyme 24-hydroxylase, whichalso prevents over-production of vitamin D by 24-hydroxylation of vitamin D [ 15]. This process of
homeostasis is regulated by UVB, PTH, and serum ionized calcium concentrations [ 16]. When an
also prevents over-production of vitamin D by 24-hydroxylation of vitamin D [ 15]. This process ofhomeostasis is regulated by UVB, PTH, and serum ionized calcium concentrations [ 16]. When anindividual is overexposed to ultraviolet rays, the mentioned built-in protective mechanism preventsexcessive retention of vitamin D in the skin. Therefore, sun exposure does not raise serum 25(OH)D topathological levels, cause hypervitaminosis D or its complications, such as hypercalcemia.In addition, vitamin D synthesized in the skin from UVB exposure in excess of need is catabolizedin part through 20-hydroxylation by the cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme CYP11A1 [ 17]. Thus,
Biology 2019 ,8, 30 3 of 15there are multiple intrinsic mechanisms present to prevent excess vitamin D from reaching thecirculation. The e ﬃciency of vitamin D synthesis in the skin is a ﬀected by many factors, including thedensity of melanin pigment, condition of the skin and age, and the use of sunscreen and UV-blockingmakeup, creams, and ointments and clothing. In addition, older age or scarred skin, as well as time ofday or year and the duration of sun exposure a ﬀect vitamin D synthesis in the skin [18–21].Although solar radiation is the source of vitamin D generation in the skin, excessive exposure,particularly in those who are genetically vulnerable, may cause skin cancers [ 22–24]. On the otherhand, optimal vitamin D status protects against several types of internal cancers, melanoma, andseveral other diseases. Therefore, one needs to balance sun exposure in favor of beneﬁts while avoidingpotential harmful e ﬀects [25–27].2. Vitamin D and Gene Regulation
2. Vitamin D and Gene Regulation1,25(OH) 2D regulates many genes within the human genome [ 28]. Tissue vitamin D concentrationsand its receptor gene polymorphisms, not only inﬂuence mechanism of actions and modulate secondmessenger systems, but also modulate the ability of the ligand-bound VDR to bind to vitamin Dresponse elements (VDREs) on promoter regions in genes and initiate second messenger systems [ 29].The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) launched a public research consortium,ENCODE [Encyclopedia of DNA Elements; http: //www.genome.gov /10005107] to answer pertinentquestions [30].ENCODE has demonstrated the genome-wide actions of 1,25(OH) 2D3on the formation rates ofproteins, such as the insulator protein CTCF (transcriptional repressor CTCF; 11-zinc ﬁnger protein,CCCTC-binding factor, etc.) and the VDR [ 31,32]. These ﬁndings suggest the presence of numerous
functional VDRE regions across the human genome [ 29,33]. In addition, it has been suggested thatthe expression of these genes could be used as biomarkers for di ﬀerent actions of vitamin D in variedtissues and cells and assessment of vulnerabilities [34].Hormone, 1,25(OH) 2D modulates cell proliferation through direct and indirect pathways. Forexample, vitamin D inhibits the pathways related to transcription factor NF- κB [35]. People withchronic non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, autoimmunediseases, arthritis, and osteoporosis are reported to have chronically elevated NF- κB [36]. NF- κBenhances the oxidative stress and cellular responses to inﬂammation and injury; including followinghead injury [ 37]. Whereas, 1,25(OH) 2D (calcitriol) suppresses NF- κB and thereby reduces chronicdiﬀuse somatic inﬂammation [ 38,39]. In addition, calcitriol also reduce cell proliferation and enhance
cell di ﬀerentiation—key anti-cancer e ﬀects of vitamin D [40].2.1. Epigenetic Mechanisms Inﬂuence Cancer GenesisEpigenetic mechanisms influence cancer genesis, growth, dissemination, and aging phenomena [ 41–44].For example, the epigenetic modiﬁcations of VDR–1,25(OH) 2D eﬀects can be mediated through complexprocesses involving CYP27A1 and CYP27B1 and via the vitamin D-catabolizing enzyme CYP24 [ 14,44].These actions can be favorably inﬂuenced by modiﬁcations of VDREs across the genome modulated byboth histone acetylases and deacetylases [28,29,45].Epigenetic regulation of vitamin D metabolism inﬂuences several physiological mechanisms andmodulate outcomes of some human diseases. Example of diseases include adenocarcinoma of thelung [ 44], speciﬁc gene mutations in Asians with advanced non-small cell lung cancer [ 41], and geneticalterations in the e ﬀectiveness of systemic therapy for lung cancer induced by cigarette smoking [42].
In severely obese children, low 25(OH)D concentrations are associated with increased markers ofoxidative and nitrosative stress, inﬂammation, and endothelial over-activation [46].
In severely obese children, low 25(OH)D concentrations are associated with increased markers ofoxidative and nitrosative stress, inﬂammation, and endothelial over-activation [46].CYP27B1-mediated target tissue production of 1,25(OH)D is critically important for the paracrineand autocrine functions of calcitriol to obtain the full biological potential of vitamin D. Taken together,the beneﬁts of having adequate serum 25(OH)D concentrations and maintaining vitamin D repletionin the long run and considering the overall health beneﬁts of vitamin D, there is an urgent need to
Biology 2019 ,8, 30 4 of 15create national policies to combat hypovitaminosis D. The savings derived from reducing the risks andseverity of infectious and parasitic diseases alone would pay-o ﬀthe cost of this public health approach.This can be achieved through targeting to raise the population serum 25(OH)D concentration, leading toa tangible positive impact on humans and on the economy.2.2. Epigenetics and Molecular Genetics of Vitamin DMolecular and genetic studies conﬁrm that vitamin D also modulates risks of several other humandiseases, including autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis [ 47]. Although the predominantcause of cancer is modulation of the underlying metabolic abnormalities through genes, such as p53and c-myc modifying the metastatic risks, the responsiveness to therapy is in part determined byepigenetic modiﬁcations of genes.Tumor-related key metabolic abnormalities include imbalance between glucose fermentation and
oxidative phosphorylation (under aerobic and anaerobic conditions—the Warburg e ﬀect); dysregulationof metabolic enzymes, such as pyruvate kinase, fumarate hydratase, and succinate dehydrogenase;isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations; and alterations of gene expression levels linked to tumorigenesisthat are inﬂuenced by the vitamin D status [48].Examples related to activity of the vitamin D axis include epigenetic changes that a ﬀect theexpression of the CYP24A1 gene and VDR polymorphisms. Although epigenetic enhancement canoccur through methylation and repression by histone-modiﬁcations of DNA, vitamin D markedlyinﬂuences the regulation of cell replication [ 42,44]. This substantiates targeting of CYP24A1 to optimizethe antiproliferative e ﬀects of 1,25(OH) 2D in a target-speciﬁc manner [49].In addition, gene activation following the interaction of 1,25(OH) 2D with VDR is important for
mitochondrial integrity and respiration, and many other physiological activities. Moreover, the vitaminD signaling pathway plays a central role in protecting cells from elevated mitochondrial respirationand associated damage and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can lead to cellularand DNA damage [50].3. Vitamin D–Oxidative Stress1,25(OH) 2D is involved in many intracellular genomic activities and biochemical and enzymaticreactions, whereas 25(OH)D concentrations are important in overcoming inﬂammation, the destructionof invading microbes and parasites, the minimization of oxidative stress following the day-to-dayexposure to toxic agents, and controlling the aging process [51,52].For example, the presence of a physiologic 25(OH)D concentration enhances the expressionof the nuclear factor, erythroid-2(Nf-E2)-related factor 2(Nrf2) [ 53–55] and enhances Klotho, a
phosphate regulating hormone and also an antiaging protein [ 56,57]. It also facilitates proteinstabilization [ 11]. Klotho also regulates cellular signaling systems, including the formation ofantioxidants [ 58]. Consequently, in mice, functional abnormalities of the Klotho gene or removal ofit through gene knock-out procedures induce premature aging syndrome [ 59]. In animal studies,ineﬃcient FGF23 and /or Klotho expression have shown to cause premature aging. Figure 1 is aschematic representation of various key factors and their interactions that inﬂuence aging and death.

Environmental, microbial, biological and chem ical interactions that modify the DNA and mitochondrial functions and epigenetics, which modi fies the aging process. Vitamin D deficiency is one of the factors that enhances this oxidative- stress cycle and accelerating premature cell death [abbreviations used: DNA = deoxyribonucleic acid; iNOS = inducible nitric oxide enzyme]. 3.1.Influences of Vitamin D on Oxidative Stress  When vitamin D status is adequate, many of the intracellular oxidative stress-related activities are downregulated. Having suboptimal concentrations of serum 25(OH)D fails to subdue oxidative stress conditions, augment intracellular oxidative damage and the rate of apoptosis. The intracellular Nrf2 level is inversely correlated with the accu mulation of mitochondrial ROS [51,60] and the
consequent escalation of oxidative stress. Thus, Nrf2 plays a key role in protecting cells against oxidative stress; this is modulated by vitamin D [61,62]. In addition, vitamin D supports cellular oxidation and reduction (redox) control by maintaining normal mitochondrial functions [63–65]. Loss in th e redox control of the cell cycle may lead to aberrant cell proliferation, cell death, the development of neurodegenerative diseases, and accelerated aging [65–68]. Peroxisome prolif erator-activated rece ptor-coactivator 1 α (PGC-1α) is bound to mitochondrial deacetylase (SIRT3). PGC-1 α directly couples to the oxidative stress cycle [69] and interacts with Nrf2. This complex regula tes the expression of SIRT3; this process is influenced by vitamin D metabolites [70]. In additi on, the activation of the mitochondrial Nrf2/PGC-1α-SIRT3 path is dependent on intracellular calcitriol concentrations.
Calcitriol has overarching beneficial effects in upregulating the expression of certain antioxidants and anti-inflammatory cytokines [71] , thereby protecting the tissues from toxins, micronutrient deficiency-related abnormalities, and parasitic and intracellular microbe-induced harm [72]. It regulates ROS levels through its anti-inflammatory effects and mitochondrial-based expression of antioxidants through cell-signaling pathways [67,73]. 4. Role of Vitamin D in Neutralization  of Toxins and Aging-Related Compounds Following 1,25(OH) 2D−VDR interaction, the transcription fa ctor Nrf2 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Nrf2 acti vates the expression of several gene s that have antioxidant activity [52,54,67]. When Nrf2 activity is insufficient, ri sks from oxidative stress-related tissue damage increases [61,74]. The resultant excessive ROS form ation by dysregulated mitochondria leads to a
pathologic oxidative stress cycle, a key cause of toxin-induced and age-related cell death [68,75,76]. Figure 1. Environmental, microbial, biological and chemical interactions that modify the DNA andmitochondrial functions and epigenetics, which modiﬁes the aging process. Vitamin D deﬁciencyis one of the factors that enhances this oxidative-stress cycle and accelerating premature cell death[abbreviations used: DNA =deoxyribonucleic acid; iNOS =inducible nitric oxide enzyme].Inﬂuences of Vitamin D on Oxidative StressWhen vitamin D status is adequate, many of the intracellular oxidative stress-related activities aredownregulated.

Loss in the redox control of the cell cycle may lead toaberrant cell proliferation, cell death, the development of neurodegenerative diseases, and acceleratedaging [ 65–68]. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-coactivator 1 α(PGC-1 α) is bound tomitochondrial deacetylase (SIRT3). PGC-1 αdirectly couples to the oxidative stress cycle [ 69] andinteracts with Nrf2. This complex regulates the expression of SIRT3; this process is inﬂuenced byvitamin D metabolites [ 70]. In addition, the activation of the mitochondrial Nrf2 /PGC-1 α-SIRT3 path isdependent on intracellular calcitriol concentrations.Calcitriol has overarching beneﬁcial e ﬀects in upregulating the expression of certain antioxidantsand anti-inﬂammatory cytokines [ 71], thereby protecting the tissues from toxins, micronutrient
deﬁciency-related abnormalities, and parasitic and intracellular microbe-induced harm [ 72]. It regulatesROS levels through its anti-inﬂammatory e ﬀects and mitochondrial-based expression of antioxidantsthrough cell-signaling pathways [67,73].4. Role of Vitamin D in Neutralization of Toxins and Aging-Related CompoundsFollowing 1,25(OH) 2D—VDR interaction, the transcription factor Nrf2 translocates from thecytoplasm to the nucleus. Nrf2 activates the expression of several genes that have antioxidantactivity [ 52,54,67]. When Nrf2 activity is insu ﬃcient, risks from oxidative stress-related tissue damage
Biology 2019 ,8, 30 6 of 15increases [ 61,74]. The resultant excessive ROS formation by dysregulated mitochondria leads to apathologic oxidative stress cycle, a key cause of toxin-induced and age-related cell death [68,75,76].Meanwhile, the Nrf2 activity in part is controlled by the cytosolic protein Keap1 [ 77], anothertranscription factor and a negative regulator of Nrf2 [ 55,61]. Keap1 also controls the subcellulardistribution of Nrf2 that correlates with its antioxidant activity [ 53,54]. When confronted withintracellular oxidative and /or electrophilic stresses, as a protective mechanism, the Nrf2-antioxidantresponse path is activated. This response enhances gene transcription and translation of proteinproducts that are necessary to eliminate and /or neutralize toxins, ROS, and cumulating aging-relatedproducts through conjugation [78,79].4.1. The Concept and the Process of Aging
4.1. The Concept and the Process of AgingAging generally refers to the biological process of growing older, also known as cellular senescence,and is a complex process. Advancing age is, especially after adulthood, is associated with a gradualdecline of physiological functions and capacities [ 80]. Aging has also been quantiﬁed from mortalitycurves using mathematical modeling; for example, by using Gompertz equation m(t) =AeGt, for which,m(t)=the mortality rate as a function of time or age ( t); A=extrapolated constant to birth or maturity;G=the exponential (Gompertz) mortality rate coe ﬃcient] [79].Moreover, efficiency and the functions of the body decline after sexual maturity, suggesting aconnection between the aging process after fulfilling the procreation needs. Most age-related functions areirreversible, in part due to accumulation of oxidative stress-related toxic products, methylation of DNA,
and mitochondrial damage, leading to reduced viability of cells and consequent accelerated cell death [ 81].There is also a parallel decline in the immune system functions (i.e., immune-senescence) and an increasein inflammation, demonstrable with increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines [ 82,83].These arelikely to contribute to several age-related disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular andpulmonary diseases, and susceptibility to autoimmunity and infections [82,83].Many bodily functions slow with aging, including response and reaction time; access to and thecapacity of memory; pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular capacities; and even the ability togenerate vitamin D in the skin. While age is perhaps the strongest risk factors for death, age-relateddisorders are the number one cause of death among the adults. This scenario is aggravated in thepresence of vitamin D deﬁciency.
presence of vitamin D deﬁciency.Chronic hypovitaminosis D is associated with cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunctions andpremature deaths [ 84], even among children [ 85]. Overall data suggest that vitamin D deﬁciency couldbe considered an important comorbidity or a risk factor for premature death [ 84–87]. In fact, inverserelationships have been reported with vitamin D adequacy, with reduced all-cause mortality [ 88–90],and cancer [90–93].4.2. E ﬀects of Vitamin D on Apoptosis and AgingThe generalized inﬂammatory process is known to cause cellular damage and increaseapoptosis [ 94], as in the case of interstitial tubular cell damage in chronic kidney disease, andthus is a part of the aging process [ 52,55,95]. In addition, hypovitaminosis D and dysfunctionalmitochondrial activity increase inﬂammation [ 73,96,97]. Thus, the anti-inﬂammatory e ﬀects fromhaving adequate, physiological vitamin D concentrations are important [ 95,98]. Hypovitaminosis D
increases the expression of inﬂammatory cytokines [ 71,99] such as tumor necrosis factor- α(TNF- α),increasing the expression of the InsP3Rs and resulting in increased intracellular Ca2+and acceleratingcellular damage, apoptosis, and aging [66,75].
increasing the expression of the InsP3Rs and resulting in increased intracellular Ca2+and acceleratingcellular damage, apoptosis, and aging [66,75].Many of the genes in the Klotho–Nrf2 regulatory system have multiple functions that are regulatedby calcitriol [ 57,62,65]. These include, increasing intracellular antioxidant concentration, maintainingthe redox homeostasis and, normal intracellular-reduced environment by removing excess ROS, andthereby down-regulating the oxidative stress [100]. In addition, the vitamin D-dependent expressionofγ-glutamyl transpeptidase, glutamate cysteine ligase, and glutathione reductase contribute to
Biology 2019 ,8, 30 7 of 15the synthesis of the key redox agent glutathione (an essential antioxidant of low–molecular-weightthiol) [99,101].Vitamin D also upregulates the expression of glutathione peroxidase that converts the ROSmolecule H 2O2to water [ 101]. Vitamin D also e ﬀect the formation of glutathione through activation ofthe enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [ 101]—which downregulates nitrogen oxide (NOx),a potent precursor for generating ROS that converts O 2−to H 2O2and upregulating superoxidedismutase (SOD). These vitamin D-related actions collectively reduce the burden of intracellular ROS.Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences that caps end of linear chromosomes protecting DNAmolecules [ 102]. Aging is associated with shortening of telomeres, including in stem cells. The amountof telomerase present is gradually become too short to maintain its protective e ﬀects on DNA during
cell division, and thus cell apoptosis. While vitamin D deﬁciency increases inﬂammation and theintracellular oxidative stress, the latter enhances the rate of telomere shortening during cell proliferation,resulting in genomic instability [36].4.3. Hypovitaminosis D Leads to Deranged Mitochondrial RespirationActivated vitamin D is an essential component for maintaining physiological respiratory chainactivity in mitochondria, facilitating the generation of energy [ 103,104]. In addition, 25(OH)D regulatesthe expression of the uncoupling protein that is attached to the inner membrane of mitochondria thatregulates thermogenesis [ 105–107]. Chronic vitamin D deﬁciency reduces the capacity of mitochondrialrespiration through modulating nuclear mRNA [ 108–110]. The latter also downregulates the expressionof complex I of the electron transport chain and thus reduces the formation of adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) [ 67,75], another mechanism that increases cancer risks. Consequently, a low level of electrontransport chain increases the formation of ROS and oxidative stress, a common phenomenon followingacute and chronic exposure to toxins and many chronic diseases and seen in aging [66,111,112].The accumulation of intracellular toxins and /or age-related products disrupts signaling pathways,including the G protein–coupled systems, caspases, mitochondria, and the death receptor-linkedmechanisms, triggering cell apoptosis and causing premature cell death [ 113,114]. The process isaggravated by stimulating G proteins, leading to activation of downstream pathways, includingprotein kinase A and C (PKA and PKC), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3-kinase), Ca2+and MAPkinase-dependent systems, tyrosine phosphorylation [ 75,114], and work additively, aiding cancergenesis [93] and accelerating the aging process.4.4. Calcitriol Protects Mitochondrial Functions
4.4. Calcitriol Protects Mitochondrial FunctionsToxins, chronic metabolic abnormalities, and the aging process are known to cause mitochondrialdysfunction [ 66,106–108,115]. Abnormal mitochondria produce suboptimal amounts of ATP whilegenerating excess ROS, creating a vicious cycle of enhanced and persisting the e ﬀects from excessiveoxidative stress [ 106,107,116]. These events cause DNA damage (and impair DNA repair systems),premature cell death, and accelerated aging [ 62,66]. Data are accumulating that suggest thatmitochondrial dysfunction is likely fueled by sustained intracellular inﬂammation, as in the case withvitamin D deﬁciency [79,95,97,117].Based on animal studies, researchers have reported that mitochondrial decay, a part of theaging process, can be slowed by micronutrient supplementation (e.g., by lipoic acid, acetyl carnitine,vitamin K, and vitamin D) and by boosting coenzyme levels through high doses of vitamin B, such
as pantothenic acid [ 118]. The NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases sirtuins function as antiagingproteins that also neutralize excess ROS [ 11]. For example, sirtuin 1 (SIRT) is essential to maintaining
proteins that also neutralize excess ROS [ 11]. For example, sirtuin 1 (SIRT) is essential to maintainingnormal mitochondrial functions; meanwhile, calcitriol and SIRT1 work synergistically to regeneratemitochondria [ 119,120]. Their actions facilitate the removal and neutralization of toxins and therebyreduce the rate and the e ﬀects of aging [121,122].Dysfunctional mitochondria also have reduced intracellular Ca2+buﬀering capacity, resulting inincreased (and ﬂuctuating) intracellular Ca2+levels, which are cytotoxic and contribute to sustenance
Biology 2019 ,8, 30 8 of 15of several chronic diseases [ 108,115]. Sub physiological concentrations of calcitriol, at least in part,enhance and maintain oxidative stress, autophagy, inﬂammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, epigeneticchanges, DNA damage, intracellular Ca2+, and generation and signaling of ROS. Therefore, sustained,adequate serum 25(OH)D concentrations should allow target tissues to keep many of these harmfulprocesses under control [ 68,71,73].

Discussion The proper functioning of the vitamin D endocrine,  paracrine, and autocrine systems is essential for many human physiological func tions. Vitamin D deficiency, as determined by serum 25(OH)D concentrations of less than 30 ng/mL, is associated  with increased risks of illnesses and disorders and increased all-cause mortality even among apparently healthy individuals, including those with normal serum 1,25(OH) 2D. Some of the key functions of vitami n D include subduing oxidative stress and chronic inflammation and maintaining mitochondr ial respiratory functions. Through its targeted
mitochondrial activity and subduing of ROS th rough multiple mechanis ms, vitamin D has key beneficial effects on controlling oxidative stress, inflammation, and energy metabolism. Normal serum concentrations of both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2D are essential for optimal cellular function and protect from the excessive oxidativ e stress-related DNA damage. However, increased risk for illnesses and reduced longevity can occur despite the presence of physiologic concentrations of calcitriol because this is not the only mechanism protecting cells from oxidative stress. Physiologic serum 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2D levels in target tissues allow exer tion of the homeostatic modulatory effects on enzymatic reactions, mitochondrial activi ties, and functioning of optimal second messenger systems. These are essential parts of the action s of vitamin D mediated through the mentioned mechanisms. Vitamin D metabolism and functions are modulated by many factors, including physical
activities and lifestyles, certain medications, environmental pollutan ts, and epigenetics, all of which also modify the balance between energy intake and expenditure through mitochondrial metabolic control [123]. For reductions in the incidence of diseases, longer-term maintenance of a steady state Figure 2. Oxidative stress is harmful to cells. Controlling oxidative stresses through vitamin D adequacyleads to cellular and organ protection and reduces the e ﬀects of aging [abbreviations used: CNS =central nervous system; DNA =deoxyribonucleic acid; MI =myocardial infarction; PVD =peripheralvascular diseases].5. DiscussionThe proper functioning of the vitamin D endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine systems is essentialfor many human physiological functions. Vitamin D deﬁciency, as determined by serum 25(OH)Dconcentrations of less than 30 ng /mL, is associated with increased risks of illnesses and disorders
and increased all-cause mortality even among apparently healthy individuals, including those withnormal serum 1,25(OH) 2D. Some of the key functions of vitamin D include subduing oxidative
and increased all-cause mortality even among apparently healthy individuals, including those withnormal serum 1,25(OH) 2D. Some of the key functions of vitamin D include subduing oxidativestress and chronic inﬂammation and maintaining mitochondrial respiratory functions. Through itstargeted mitochondrial activity and subduing of ROS through multiple mechanisms, vitamin D haskey beneﬁcial e ﬀects on controlling oxidative stress, inﬂammation, and energy metabolism.Normal serum concentrations of both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2D are essential for optimal cellularfunction and protect from the excessive oxidative stress-related DNA damage. However, increasedrisk for illnesses and reduced longevity can occur despite the presence of physiologic concentrations ofcalcitriol because this is not the only mechanism protecting cells from oxidative stress. Physiologic serum25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2D levels in target tissues allow exertion of the homeostatic modulatory e ﬀects
on enzymatic reactions, mitochondrial activities, and functioning of optimal second messenger systems.These are essential parts of the actions of vitamin D mediated through the mentioned mechanisms.Vitamin D metabolism and functions are modulated by many factors, including physical activitiesand lifestyles, certain medications, environmental pollutants, and epigenetics, all of which also modify
Biology 2019 ,8, 30 9 of 15the balance between energy intake and expenditure through mitochondrial metabolic control [ 123].For reductions in the incidence of diseases, longer-term maintenance of a steady state of the serum25(OH)D concentration is necessary [ 124]. The minimal level is considered to be 30 ng /mL (50 nmol /L).After correction of vitamin D deﬁciency through loading doses of oral vitamin D (or safe sunexposure), adequate maintenance doses of vitamin D 3are needed. This can be achieved in approximately90% of the adult population with vitamin D supplementation between 1000 to 4000 IU /day, 10,000 IUtwice a week, or 50,000 IU twice a month [ 10,125]. On a population basis, such doses would allowapproximately 97% of people to maintain their serum 25(OH)D concentrations above 30 ng /mL [ 19,126].Others, such as persons with obesity, those with gastrointestinal disorders, and during pregnancy andlactation, are likely to require doses of 6,000 IU /day [127,128].
