Drug-basedtherapies using minoxidil and ﬁnasteride for the treatment of alopecia are available, but they haveshown various side effects in patients. Thus, the use of new therapeutic approaches using bioactiveproducts to reduce the risk of anti-hair-loss medications has been emphasized. Natural products havebeen used since ancient times and have been proven safe, with few side effects. Several studies havedemonstrated the use of plants and their extracts to promote hair growth. Moreover, commercialproducts based on these natural ingredients have been developed for the treatment of alopecia.
Several clinical, animal, and cell-based studies have been conducted to determine the anti-alopeciaeffects of plant-derived biochemicals. This review is a collective study of phytochemicals with anti-alopecia effects, focusing mainly on the mechanisms underlying their hair-growth-promoting effects.Keywords: alopecia; natural product; hair growth1. IntroductionHair affects the impacts of thermoregulation, physical protection, and social inter-action [ 1]. Hair disorders, which include alopecia, anagen efﬂuvium, telogen efﬂuvium,hirsutism, hypertrichosis, and miniaturization, negatively affect health [ 2]. Alopecia isdeﬁned as a decrease in hair density and can be considered a common symptom of severalpathologies, such as inﬂammation and infection [ 3]. Alopecia can be a sign of a systemicdisease, including thyroid dysfunction, systemic lupus erythematosus, trichotillomania,or infection [ 3]. Although alopecia is a non-life-threatening condition, it can affect the
esthetics, social activities, and quality of life of individuals [ 4]. Hair growth is the result ofthe growth and differentiation of hair follicles (HFs) comprising dermal papilla cells (DPCs)and epithelial cells. The formation of HF involves four cycles: anagen (growth), catagen(regression), telogen (rest), and exogen (shedding). The hair cycle transition is controlledby several growth stimulatory or inhibitory factors [ 5]. Alopecia can be categorized intoseveral classes. Androgenetic alopecia, the most common form of alopecia, is a male orfemale pattern hair loss that is characterized by a progressive loss of hair diameter, length,and pigmentation. It is caused by genetic factors and inadequate androgen signaling [ 6].Androgenetic alopecia also worsens conditions such as drug side effects, acute stressors,and weight loss [ 6]. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder (similar disorders include
thyroid disease, celiac disease, vitiligo, and atopy) caused by lymphocytes that attack thebulb of HFs in the anagen phase [ 7]. This disease affects up to 2% of the population and
thyroid disease, celiac disease, vitiligo, and atopy) caused by lymphocytes that attack thebulb of HFs in the anagen phase [ 7]. This disease affects up to 2% of the population andcommonly occurs during childhood or adolescence [ 7]. Patients with alopecia areata mayexperience sudden hair loss [ 8]. Telogen efﬂuvium refers to the loss of telogen hair due toabnormal hair circulation, and generally 100–200 telogen hairs are lost every day [ 9]. Thecauses of acute telogen efﬂuvium (in which hair loss lasts less than six months) includessystemic disease, drugs, fever, psychological/emotional stress, weight loss, childbirth, ironand vitamin D deﬁciency, inﬂammatory scalp disorders, interruption of oral contraceptives,Pharmaceutics 2021 ,13, 2163. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13122163 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics
Pharmaceutics 2021 ,13, 2163 2 of 24and iron deﬁciency [ 10]. Primary cicatricial alopecia, known as scarring alopecia, encom-passes hair loss disorders in which the hair follicle is irreversibly destroyed [ 11]. Secondarycicatricial alopecia occurs from irreversible loss of hair follicles due to thermal burns,metastatic cancer, trauma, or radiation [ 11]. To date, the US Food and Drug Administration(FDA)-approved non-surgical treatment alternatives for hair loss include drugs such asminoxidil and ﬁnasteride. Minoxidil is converted to minoxidil sulfate by sulfotransferasepresent in the scalp, which promotes the growth of hair follicular cells and reduces hairloss [ 12]. Finasteride is a 5 α-reductase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of testosteroneto dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which causes androgenetic alopecia [ 13]. However, thesedrugs have side effects in patients. Thus, it is necessary to identify new, safe, and effectivedrugs to treat hair loss.
drugs to treat hair loss.Recently, interest in hair loss prevention using natural products or their extracts hasincreased. Products currently marketed as using natural ingredients include those usedto prevent hair loss in the form of hair tonics, hair growth promoters, hair conditioners,and hair cleansers [ 14]. Plants and their extracts contain multiple components, suchas polyphenols, ﬂavonoids, terpenoids, carotenoids, and fatty acids, which support themaintenance of HF health [ 15]. Plant-based formulations have the advantage of being easyto acquire from low-cost materials, and their non-toxic effects have been noted since ancienttimes. Although natural products are widely used to prevent hair loss, little is knownabout their exact mechanisms of action. The present study is a review of the molecularmechanisms underlying the hair-promoting effects of various herbs and their constituents.2. Biochemical Action of Herbs and Their Extracts

Pharmaceutics 2021 ,13, 2163 4 of 24Figure 1. Interactions between herbs and their mechanisms for hair-growth-promoting efﬁcacies.2.1. Growth FactorsNumerous growth factors were expressed in the HFs. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF),vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), insulin-likegrowth factor (IGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)act as hair growth stimulators, and transforming growth factor- β1 (TGF- β1) is a hairgrowth suppressor [ 6]. VEGF is secreted by DPCs and is involved in hair growth throughthe formation of new blood vessels around follicles [ 58,59]. VEGF expression is decreasedin HFs during alopecia compared to that in normal follicles [ 59]. IGF-1 signaling has beenreported to inﬂuence HF development and tissue renewal [ 60]. IGF-1 prevents HFs fromentering the catagen phase [ 61,62]. The FGF family consists of 22 members and regulates
a variety of biological functions [ 63]. Basic FGF (FGF-2) and KGF-2 (FGF-10) stimulateHF growth [ 64]. KGF mediates growth, development, and differentiation of HF [ 6]. HGFis involved in the stimulation of mouse follicle growth and HF elongation in vitro andin vivo [65,66]. TGF- β1 and its receptors are involved in the catagen phase of the hair cycleand promote tissue remodeling and apoptosis [67].

Pharmaceutics 2021 ,13, 2163 10 of 24Sinapic acid exhibits various biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory ,anticancer, anti-hyperglycemic, and neuroprotective effects [ 68–73]. Sinapic acid treatmenthas been reported to increase VEGF and IGF-1 expression and increase the proliferation ofhuman HF-derived dermal papilla cells (hHFDPCs) [ 16]. Icariin is a bioactive compound fromEpimedium brevicornum Maxim extract, which possesses testosterone mimetic properties andanti-osteoporotic and antidepressant-like effects [ 74–76]. Treatment with icariin increased IGF-1secretion in vibrissae follicles and upregulated IGF-1 mRNA and protein levels in DPCs [ 17].Geranium sibiricum L., belonging to the family Geraniaceae, has been used globally as an an-tioxidant and anti-inflammatory substance [ 77–79]. Geranium sibiricum extract increased HGFand VEGF expression, and decreased TGF- β1 expression in vitro andin vivo [18]. Oleuropein,
an olive constituent, is a phenolic glycoside that possesses several pharmacological proper-ties, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, cardioprotective, and neuroprotectiveeffects [ 80–82]. Topical administration of oleuropein (0.4 mg/day) significantly upregulatedIGF-1, KGF, HGF, and VEGF mRNA expression in mouse skin tissue compared with controlmice [ 19]. Caffeine is a well-known stimulant that is widely consumed in common bever-ages [ 83]. It acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and possesses biological activities, includingantioxidant and cancer preventive effects [ 83–86]. Treatment with caffeine (0.001%) and testos-terone (5 µg/mL) significantly increased IGF-1 expression but decreased TGF- β2 expression inhuman outer sheath keratinocytes [ 20].Carthamus tinctorius L., known as Safflower, has beenused in various medical conditions [ 87,88].Carthamus tinctorius L. extract (CTE) decreased
5α-reductase activity and promoted hair growth in mice [ 89]. CTE increased VEGF and KGFmRNA expression and decreased TGF- β1 expression in vitro [21]. Red ginseng oil (RGO) ex-tracted from red ginseng possesses antioxidant [ 90] and anti-inflammatory [ 91,92] effects, andits major constituents include linoleic acid (LA), β-sitosterol (SITOS), and bicyclo(10.1.0)tridec-1-ene (BICYCLO) [ 93]. Truong et al., revealed that RGO (10%) exhibited hair regenerationcapacity in a testosterone-induced androgenic alopecia C57BL/6 mouse model [ 22]. RGOand its main compounds decreased the expression of TGF- β1 compared with testosteronetreatment [ 22]. Quercitrin (quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside) is a flavonoid found in various plantsand has been shown to protect against cisplatin-induced hair damage [ 94]. Quercitrin treat-ment resulted in an increase in bFGF, KGF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA, and
VEGF mRNA and protein levels in hDPCs [ 23].Sophora flavescens possesses various pharmaco-logical properties, including anti-inflammatory , anti-arthritic, and antioxidant effects [ 95,96].It has been demonstrated that Sophora flavescens extract promoted hair growth by inducingmRNA expression of IGF-1 and KGF in cultured DP cells [24]. Shikimic acid is commerciallyused in cosmetics and has been shown to possess antibacterial, anti-inflammatory , antifungal,anti-aging, and whitening effects [ 97]. A recent study revealed that shikimic acid upregulatedthe mRNA expression of HGF, KGF, and VEGF in hDPCs [ 25]. Procyanidin (PC)-B3 is aprocyanidin dimer that has been studied for its hair-growth-promoting effect [ 98,99]. Thestudy showed increased hair-growing activity in vitro and anagen-inducing activity in vivo ,as well as a potential inhibitory effect of TGF- β1 [26]. Ginsenosides present in Ginseng Radix
et Rhizoma are Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, Rd, Re, Rg1, Rg3, and Rh2, and ginsenoside Rb1 is one of theactive compounds present in ginseng [ 100]. Studies have reported the hair-promoting effects
et Rhizoma are Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, Rd, Re, Rg1, Rg3, and Rh2, and ginsenoside Rb1 is one of theactive compounds present in ginseng [ 100]. Studies have reported the hair-promoting effectsof ginseng extract and ginsenosides in vitro and in vivo [100]. Ginsenoside Rb1 treatmentinduced VEGF-A and VEGF receptor 2 and attenuated TGF- β1 expression [ 27]. Nelumbi-nis Semen (NS) is a widely used functional food that contains nutritional compounds withtherapeutic benefits [ 101,102]. NS improved oxidative stress on the scalp of hair loss pa-tients due to its high content of total polyphenols and flavonoids [ 103]. Park et al. alsoshowed that NS extract possessed a strong antioxidant capacity and may reduce the ox-idative damage that causes hair loss [ 28]. NS-extract-treated mice showed increased VEGFand IGF-1 mRNA expression [ 28]. However, TGF- β1 mRNA expression was decreased af-ter NS extract treatment compared to that after dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) treatment [ 28].
Chamaecyparis obtusa (CO), belonging to the family Cupressaceae, has alpha-terpinyl acetate,sabinene, isobornyl acetate, and limonene as major constituents [ 104]. An essential oil from
Pharmaceutics 2021 ,13, 2163 11 of 24CO has shown anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities in previous studies [ 104–107].In the CO-treated mice group, IGF-1 mRNA expression was increased compared with thatin the group treated with 3% minoxidil for 4 weeks. VEGF expression was also upregulatedin the skin of mice after CO treatment [ 29]. Polygonum multiflorum (PM) has been usedin Chinese medical practices [ 108] and reported to have various actions, including antioxi-dant [ 109], anti-human-immunodeficiency-virus (HIV) [ 110], neuroprotective [ 111,112], andhepatoprotective effects [ 113]. 2,3,5,4-Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-D-glucoside (TSG), a majorcomponent of PM, induces new hair growth in C57BL/6J mice [ 113]. Additionally , Shin et al.,observed that PM extract (20 µg/mL) increased IGFBP2, PDGF, and VEGF expression incultured hDPCs [ 30]. Alnus sibirica Fisch. ex Turcz (AS), belonging to the family Betulaceae,
is rich in flavonoids [ 114], tannins [ 115,116], and diarylheptanoids [ 117]. AS or oregonin(active substance in AS) treatment increased IGF-1 levels and decreased TGF- β1 levels inH2O2-induced stressed hDPCs [ 31].Malva verticillate (MV) is an edible plant widely used inEast Asia [ 118]. MV is a rich source of phenolic compounds that possess antioxidants [ 119],anti-complementary , hypoglycemic [ 120], and antidiabetic effects by activating AMP-activatedprotein kinase [ 121]. MV seed extract treatment upregulated the mRNA expression of growthfactors, including IGF-1, KGF, VEGF, and HGF [ 32]. In another study , LA in MV seeds alsoelevated IGF-1, KGF, VEGF, and HGF mRNA expression in cultured hDPCs [ 33]. Liposomalhonokiol is a natural extract from Magnolia officinalis [122,123] and mainly possesses anticancereffects [ 124,125]. Li et al. demonstrated that it has a hair-promoting effect, including increased
thickness of the dermis and the number of HF in C57BL/6N mice [ 34]. Liposomal honokioltreatment inhibited TGF- β1 protein expression and phosphorylated SMAD2 expression in theouter root sheath (ORS), as determined using immunohistochemistry analysis [34].2.2. CytokinesCytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 α, IL-1 β, tumor necrosis factor- α(TNF- α), interferon-γ(IFN- γ), IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5 can influence the hair cycle [ 126]. IL-1 α, IL-1 β, and TNF- αarepotent inducers of hair loss [ 127,128]. These cytokines exhibit similar patterns in alopeciaareata, which involves abnormal keratinization of the hair matrix [ 129]. Overexpression ofIL-lαin transgenic mice led to the development of inflammatory skin diseases, such as hairloss [ 130]. C57BL/6 mice overexpressing TNF- α, IL-1 β, and IFN- γpromote keratinocyteapoptosis associated with hair loss [ 131]. Clinical data revealed elevated serum levels of
IL-4 in patients with localized alopecia areata [ 132].Angelica gigas Nakai (AGN) has beenextensively studied as a medicinal plant [ 133]. In particular, the roots of AGN showedantinociceptive activity in pain models [ 134], and neuroprotective [ 135] and beneﬁcialeffects in treating ischemia [ 136]. A recent study demonstrated that treatment with de-cursin (0.15%), a major component isolated from AGN root, or AGN root extract (2%)for 17 days stimulated hair growth in vivo [35]. These treatments reduced the proteinlevels of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (TNF- αand IL-1 β) and increased anti-inﬂammatorycytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) in the dorsal skin of mice [ 35]. 3-Deoxysappanchalcone (DSC) isa biologically active compound from Caesalpinia sappan L., which has been suggested tohave anti-inﬂammatory, anticancer, and anti-allergic effects [ 137–139]. 3-DSC treatment(0.1–3 µM) increased IL-6-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
3 expression in hDPCs [ 36]. 3-DSC also inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT6 mediated byIL-4 [ 36]. Another study reported that subjects with androgenic alopecia treated with sham-
3 expression in hDPCs [ 36]. 3-DSC also inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT6 mediated byIL-4 [ 36]. Another study reported that subjects with androgenic alopecia treated with sham-poo containing Inula helenium and Caesalpinia Sappan extract (3-DSC) showed increasedhair density and hair count [ 140]. Broussonetia papyrifera (BP), also known as papermulberry, is a medicinal herb that utilizes leaves, fruits, and bark [ 141]. The polysaccharideextract from the fruits of BP showed antioxidant and antibacterial activities [ 142]. The BProot extract contains ﬂavonoids, which results in inhibitory effects on nitric oxide, induciblenitric oxide synthase, TNF- α, and IL-6 [ 143]. Treatment with BP eliminated IL-4-inducedSTAT6 phosphorylation in hDPCs [37].
Pharmaceutics 2021 ,13, 2163 12 of 242.3. Wnt/ β-CateninWnt/ β-catenin signaling is broadly utilized and plays a crucial role in HF morpho-genesis [ 144]. In canonical Wnt/ β-catenin signaling, Wnt proteins bind to Frizzled (FZD)receptors and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) co-receptors.Once activated, the β-catenin complex with APC and Axin is phosphorylated by caseinkinase I α(CKI α) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 β(GSK-3 β). Therefore, β-catenin ac-cumulates in the cytoplasm and binds to the transcription factor T-cell factor/lymphoidenhancing factor (TCF/LEF) in the nucleus [ 145]. The study reported that Wnt/ β-cateninactivation promotes hair regeneration by inhibiting GSK-3 βin hDPCs [ 146]. Sinapic acidtreatment increased the protein level of β-catenin by upregulating phosphorylated GSK-3 βand Akt [ 16]. Oleuropein elevated nuclear β-catenin protein expression and increased
LEF1 and cyclin D1 mRNA expression in DPCs [ 19]. Oleuropein administration increasedthe mRNA levels of Wnt10B, LRP5, and FZDR1, and the protein level of β-catenin inmice compared to minoxidil-treated C57BL/6 mice [ 19]. RGO remarkably increased theprotein expression of β-catenin and LEF1 induced by testosterone and RGO co-treatmentin dorsal skin tissues compared to treatment with testosterone alone [ 22]. RGO also en-hanced β-catenin and phosphorylated GSK-3 βprotein expression in C57BL/6 mouse skincompared to that in the minoxidil-treated group [ 38]. Thuja orientalis (TO) is used to treatdermatitis, gout, and chronic tracheitis [ 147]. TO (5.05 mg/cm2/day) administration pro-moted hair growth and the early anagen phase, and prolonged the mature anagen phase inmice [ 39]. Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased β-catenin expression after TOtreatment [ 39]. 3,4,5-Tri-O-caffeoylquinic acid (TCQA) is a caffeoylquinic acid derivative
that acts as a neuroprotective agent and protects against amyloid- β(Aβ)-induced celldeath [ 148,149]. Topical treatment with 1% TCQA prolonged anagen phase induction inC3H mice for 30 days [ 40]. It was also conﬁrmed that β-catenin expression increased in theskin of TCQA-treated mice and HFDPCs [ 40]. Gene expression proﬁle data revealed anincrease in the expression of the canonical Wnt-associated genes, Ctnnb1, Wls, Wnt2b, andWnt4 after TCQA treatment [ 40].Ishige sinicola (IS) is a brown alga that exhibits variousactivities, including osteoblastic bone formation [ 150] and anti-inﬂammatory effects [ 151].IS treatment for 3 weeks increased hair-ﬁber length in rat vibrissa follicles and inducedanagen progression of the hair shaft [ 41]. Protein expression of β-catenin and phosphoryla-tion of GSK3 βwere increased after treatment with IS in cultured DPCs [ 41]. Prunus miraKoehne (PK) is a wild peach species that contains various nutrients and fatty acids [ 152].
Zhou et al. , showed the hair-promoting effect of nut oil from PK [ 42]. They demonstratedthat nut oil from PK increased hair length in mice and upregulated Wnt10B, β-catenin, andGSK-3 βexpression in mice [ 42]. Costunolide, a constituent of Saussurea lappa , has beenused as an antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory, and anticancer agent [ 153–155]. Costunolideincreased cell proliferation and β-catenin expression in hHFDPCs [ 43]. Morroniside isthe main component of Cornus ofﬁcinalis and possesses neuroprotective, anti-apoptotic,and antioxidant effects [ 156–159]. Morroniside increased Wnt/ β-catenin signaling by up-regulating Wnt10B, β-catenin, and LEF1 in cultured human ORS cells [ 44]. In a mousemodel, morroniside promoted the anagen phase and delayed the catagen phase of HF,which was partly related to an increase in β-catenin expression [ 44]. 3-DSC inhibitedthe phosphorylation of β-catenin protein but promoted the transcriptional activity of
TCF/LEF [ 36]. Timosaponin BII extracted from Anemarrhena asphodeloides rhizome is
the phosphorylation of β-catenin protein but promoted the transcriptional activity ofTCF/LEF [ 36]. Timosaponin BII extracted from Anemarrhena asphodeloides rhizome isknown to have antioxidant [ 160], anti-inﬂammatory [ 161,162], and anticancer [ 163] proper-ties. A clinical study showed that application of timosaponin BII (0.5%) containing scalpcare solution for 28 days resulted in improvement in hair and scalp conditions, particularlyhair luster, scalp hydration, hair fall number, and scalp redness level [ 164]. A recent studyshowed that timosaponin BII (0.5%) increased the hair regrowth area and HF numberin mice [ 45]. Moreover, timosaponin BII treatment was shown to upregulate β-cateninand Wnt10B expression in the dorsal skin of mice [ 45]. The application of 20 mg/mLliposomal honokiol also increased Wnt3a and β-catenin expression [ 34].Malva verticillata(MV) is a traditional herb native to Mongolia that contains ﬂavan-3-ols, ﬂavonoids, and
Pharmaceutics 2021 ,13, 2163 13 of 24fatty acids [ 119]. MV is a therapeutic candidate for diabetes [ 121], bone disease [ 165],and cancer [ 166]. MV leaves, stems, and seeds have been shown to be a rich source ofphenolic compounds. Microbial fermentation has been used to increase the extraction yieldof bioactive compounds from natural products [ 167]. Bacillus subtilis fermentation of MVleaves exhibited an antioxidant and osteogenic effect [ 168]. The seeds of MV (50 µg/mL)activated β-catenin protein expression in cultured DPCs [ 32]. Myristoleic acid, an activecompound of MV , upregulates Wnt reporter activity [ 32]. Another study showed that LAin MV seeds increased cell proliferation and phosphorylation of GSK-3 and β-catenin inDPCs [ 33]. Salvia plebeia (SP) belongs to the family Labiaceae and is used for its antioxi-dant [ 169], anti-inﬂammatory [ 170,171], and anti-inﬂuenza [ 172] effects. It is reported to
contain ﬂavonoids, phenolic acids, and other nutrients [ 169]. SP extract enhanced the pro-liferation of hHFDPC and increased the TCF/LEF-luciferase activity as well as the level ofβ-catenin protein expression [ 46]. The use of hair tonics, including Broussonetia papyrifera(BP) extract, showed an increase in total hair count for 12 weeks in a clinical study. Inaddition, BP treatment increased TCF/LEF-luciferase activity and β-catenin protein levelsin vitro [37].Undariopsis peterseniana (UP), an edible brown seaweed, is a rich source ofnutrients and acts as an antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory agent [ 173–176]. UP extractwas shown to induce hair growth in ex vivo organ cultures [ 47]. UP extract upregulated thephosphorylation levels of β-catenin and GSK-3 βcompared with the control in DPCs [47].2.4. 5 α-Reductase Inhibitory EffectTestosterone is converted to DHT by 5 α-reductase, which is known to cause an-
drogenic alopecia [ 177]. Androgenic alopecia affects over 50% of men over the age of50 [178], compared to only 25% of women by the age of 49 and 41% of women by theage of 69 years [ 179]. Finasteride, a 5 α-reductase inhibitor, has shown improvement inandrogenic alopecia in clinical trials [ 13]. However, the use of 5- αreductase inhibitors hasrevealed that it has sexual and reproductive side effects [ 180]. DHT binds to androgenreceptors in DPCs, leading to the onset of the telogen phase [ 177].Sophora ﬂavescens orUndariopsis peterseniana treatment showed potent 5 α-reductase inhibitory effects [ 24,47].Octaphlorethol A, a constituent of Ishige sinicola, inhibited 5 α-reductase activity comparedto that of ﬁnasteride [ 41]. Costunolide treatment downregulated testosterone-induced 5 α-reductase mRNA expression in hDPCs [ 43]. Puerariae Flos (PF) has been used as a medic-inal herb for its antioxidant, antidiabetic, and protective effects against ethanol-induced
injury [181–183] . PF extract showed inhibitory effects on 5 α-reductase and hair-growth-promoting effects in mice [ 48]. Cacumen platycladi (CP) is a Chinese medicine containingorganic acids, ﬂavonoids, and phenylpropanoids [ 184]. Treatment with CP decreased DHTlevels and 5 α-reductase expression while promoting hair growth in vivo [49]. Anotherstudy showed that CP volatile oil treatment increased the proliferation of hDPCs and short-ened the time of hair regrowth [ 185]. Ginseng rhizomes have been used in medical reme-dies [ 186,187]. Ginsenoside Ro, a major ginsenoside constituent in the ginseng rhizome, hasanti-inﬂammatory [ 188,189], antioxidant [ 190], and anti-obesity [ 191] effects. Murata et al.,revealed that red ginseng rhizome extract, ginsenoside Ro, and ginsenoside Rg3 showedinhibitory effects on 5 α-reductase activity [ 50]. The study also showed that topical adminis-tration of red ginseng rhizomes (2 mg/mouse) and ginsenoside Ro (0.2 mg/mouse) induced
hair regrowth in testosterone-treated mice [ 50]. Physcion, a component of Polygonum
tration of red ginseng rhizomes (2 mg/mouse) and ginsenoside Ro (0.2 mg/mouse) inducedhair regrowth in testosterone-treated mice [ 50]. Physcion, a component of Polygonummultiforum (PM), has anti-inﬂammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer effects [ 192,193].Treatment with physcion exhibited hair growth-promoting activity in testosterone -treatedC57BL/6 mice [ 51]. In addition, physcion inhibits 5 α-reductase expression in vivo [51].Rosmarinus ofﬁcinalis belongs to the Lamiaceae family and has been widely studied for itsantibacterial, antioxidant, and anticancer activities [ 194–196]. Murata et al. showed thatRosmarinus ofﬁcinalis leaf extract improved hair regrowth in mice, as well as 5 α-reductaseinhibitory activity [ 52].Avicennia marina is used in traditional medicine for the treatmentof skin diseases, rheumatism, ulcers, and smallpox [ 197]. Avicequinone C, isolated fromAvicennia marina , attenuated 5 α-reductase inhibitory activity (IC50of 38.8±1.29µM) [53] .
Pharmaceutics 2021 ,13, 2163 14 of 24Ecklonia cava, an edible marine brown alga, contains a variety of bioactive compounds,including phlorotannins, carotenoids, and fucoidans [ 198].Ecklonia cava has been reportedto have various biological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory, anti-allergy,and anticancer effects [ 199]. Shin et al., showed that Ecklonia cava polyphenols reducedoxidative stress in hDPCs [ 54]. It was found that androgens, the main cause of androgenalopecia, increase reactive oxidative species (ROS) in hDPCs in which androgen receptorsare overexpressed [ 54]. In addition, TGF- β-1 secretion induced by androgen was inhibitedby an ROS scavenger, indicating that antioxidants can promote hair growth [ 54]. Topicalapplication of 0.5% Ecklonia cava enzymatic extract induced anagen progression on the backof C57BL/6 mice [ 200]. Furthermore, the Ecklonia cava enzymatic extract, dieckol, inhibited5α-reductase activity [200].
5α-reductase activity [200].2.5. Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) SignalingThe hedgehog pathway is one of the most important signaling pathways in tissuedevelopment, homeostasis, and repair [ 201]. Hedgehog signaling is triggered by Sonichedgehog (Shh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh), and Desert hedgehog (Dhh). Shh signalingplays an important role in HF development [ 202]. Hedgehog signaling occurs throughthe binding of hedgehog ligands to the receptor Patched (PTCH) 1, which suppressesthe activation of Smoothened (SMO). Inhibition of SMO results in the translocation of theglioma-associated (GLI) gene to the nucleus [ 202]. Shh plays an essential role in the cell–cellinteractions involved in the morphogenesis of hair follicles [ 203]. Hair follicle developmentresults from complex signaling between epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Various signal-ing pathways are involved in hair follicle development, such as Wnt, bone morphogenetic
protein (BMP), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), Notch, and ectodysplasin, and theyexhibit signaling crosstalk with the hedgehog pathway [ 201]. RGO treatment upregu-lated Shh signaling-related expression of Shh, SMO, and GLI1 in testosterone-inducedC57BL/6 mice [ 22] and in mouse skin [ 38]. TO treatment resulted in an increase in Shhexpression [ 39]. Costunolide elevated GLI1 mRNA and protein expression in hDPCs [ 43].Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a major bioactive molecule in green tea that has beenshown to act on multiple molecular targets to ameliorate various human diseases [ 204].Green tea leaf extracts have polyphenolic components that exhibit anti-inﬂammatory andstress-inhibitory effects, which may inﬂuence mouse hair growth [ 205]. EGCG treatmentpromoted the growth of mink hair follicles and the proliferation of DPCs and outer rootsheath cells (ORSCs) [ 55]. EGCG has also been shown to increase the protein levels of Shh,
PTCH, Smo, and Gli1 in hair follicles [55].2.6. ApoptosisApoptosis plays an important role in morphological development and is accompaniedby a number of characteristic morphological changes, including cell shrinkage, nuclearcondensation, and cellular fragmentation [ 206]. There are two major apoptosis signalingpathways: the death receptor (extrinsic) pathway and the mitochondria-mediated path-way [ 207]. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by cell-surface-expressed death receptors ofthe tumor necrosis factor superfamily. Once the receptor is activated, caspase-8 is activatedand initiates apoptosis by direct cleavage of downstream effector caspases [ 207]. Theintrinsic pathway is initiated by intracellular stresses, and it induces permeabilizationof the outer mitochondrial membrane and activates the mitochondrial pathway. Oncemitochondrial permeabilization occurs, cytochrome c is released into the cytosol and asso-
ciates with caspase-9 and Apaf-1 to form apoptosomes, which can activate caspase-3 orcaspase-7, causing apoptosis [ 207]. Apoptosis signaling is attenuated by a particular group
ciates with caspase-9 and Apaf-1 to form apoptosomes, which can activate caspase-3 orcaspase-7, causing apoptosis [ 207]. Apoptosis signaling is attenuated by a particular groupof proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) [ 208]. Another group of proteins (Bax, Bak, Bok, Bim,Bad, Bcl-xS, and Bid) act as apoptotic agonists that promote apoptosis [ 208]. In the anagenphase, hair follicular cells undergo dynamic cell proliferation and differentiation to formthe hair shaft [ 209]. During the catagen phase, growth factors expressed by DPCs causea decrease in the proliferation and differentiation of hair matrix keratinocytes, leading
Pharmaceutics 2021 ,13, 2163 15 of 24to apoptosis [ 210,211]. The anagen-catagen transition plays a clinically important rolein human hair growth; the abnormal termination of the anagen phase has been shownto cause gradual hair thinning [ 211]. Therefore, extension of the anagen phase is a keystrategy for the prevention of hair loss. Caffeine administration inhibits apoptosis andnecrosis in human ORS keratinocytes [ 20]. The decrease in the protein level of Bcl-2 intestosterone-treated mice was reversed after treatment with RGO, LA, and SITOS [ 22].Treatment with RGO after UVC exposure inhibited cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9,and cleaved poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) expression in mouse skin tissues [ 38]. Inaddition, RGO treatment resulted in an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in the UVC-treated groupcompared to that in the control group [ 38]. Quercitrin administration resulted in a decrease
in mRNA expression of Bad, although the mRNA and protein expression of Bcl-2 increasedafter treatment of cultured hDPCs with 10 nM and 100 nM quercitrin [ 23]. PM extractalso showed an increase in Bcl-2 mRNA expression and a decrease in Bad expression inhDPCs [ 30]. Panax ginseng extract inhibited apoptosis in Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1)-induced ORSkeratinocytes as determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTPnick end labeling (TUNEL) staining [ 56]. Moreover, Panax ginseng extract downregulatedthe mRNA expression of Bcl-2 and upregulated the mRNA expression of Bax in DKK-1-induced ORS keratinocytes and HF [ 56]. AS treatment increased protein expression of Bcl-2but led to a decrease in the protein levels of Bax, PARP , and caspase-3 in HFDPCs [ 31]. SPextract elevated the protein expression of Bcl-2 and decreased Bax expression comparedwith the negative or positive control (10 µM minoxidil) in hDPCs [ 46]. The extract from the
berries Serenoa repens (SR), commonly known as saw palmetto, showed therapeutic effectsas a 5 α-reductase inhibitor [ 212]. SR and DHT co-treatment stimulated hair growth com-pared to that induced by DHT in vivo [57]. Moreover, SR treatment led to a decrease in theprotein expression of TGF- β2, cleaved caspase-3, and Bax, but increased Bcl-2 expressioncompared to DHT treatment [57].2.7. Cell CycleCell proliferation is controlled by factors that regulate the transition between differentcell cycle stages in mammalian cells [ 213]. Cell cycle progression also plays a major role inHF biology [ 214]. The cell cycle consists of four phases: gap phase 1 (G1), DNA synthesis(S), gap phase 2 (G2), and mitosis (M) [ 214]. Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)function as regulators of the G1/S or G2/M phases [ 215]. Cyclin D1 binds to CDK4 andCDK6 and drives cell cycle progression into the G1 phase [ 213]. Cyclin E associates with
CDK2 to promote G1-S phase transition [ 214]. Sinapic acid treatment was accompaniedby an increase in cyclin D1 and the distribution of cells in the G0/G1 phase, as well asa decreased distribution in the S and G2/M phases [ 16]. Cyclin D1 is a direct target fortransactivation by the β-catenin/LEF-1 pathway through an LEF-1 binding site in the cyclinD1 promoter and is a direct downstream molecule in the β-catenin pathway [ 213]. Wooet al. suggested that sinapic acid treatment increased cell growth and cell cycle progressionthrough an increase in cyclin D1 expression [ 16]. Administration of RGO increased theprotein expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E in testosterone-treated mice [ 22] and C57BL/6mouse models [ 38]. UP treatment upregulated cyclin D1, phospho(ser780)-pRB, cyclin E,phospho -CDK2, and CDK2 protein expression in DPCs [ 47]. Treatment with IS upregulatedcyclin E and CDK2 expression in cultured DPCs [ 41]. LA in MV seeds increased the mRNA
levels of cyclin D1 and CDK2 in vitro [33]. EGCG treatment increased the number of cellsin S phase, and upregulated the protein levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 [55].3. Conclusions
levels of cyclin D1 and CDK2 in vitro [33]. EGCG treatment increased the number of cellsin S phase, and upregulated the protein levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 [55].3. ConclusionsThis study reviewed the beneﬁcial effects of herbs and their bioactive compounds onhair growth, and their underlying mechanisms of action (growth factors and cytokines,Wnt/ β-catenin, 5 α-reductase inhibitory effect, sonic hedgehog signaling, apoptosis, andcell cycle progression). The herbs and their constituents investigated in this study act viamultiple signaling mechanisms in the prevention of alopecia. Therefore, they have the
Pharmaceutics 2021 ,13, 2163 16 of 24potential to be more effective than minoxidil and ﬁnasteride, which are conventionallyused to treat hair loss. In this review, we have attempted to provide a database of phy-tochemicals for hair-growth-promoting effects. This information will serve as a basis fordeveloping more effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of alopecia and improvingour understanding of their mechanisms of action.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, S.P .; writing—original draft preparation, J.L.; writing—review and editing, S.P . and J.L.; visualization, J.L.; supervision, S.P .; project administration, S.P .and J.L.; funding acquisition, J.L.
