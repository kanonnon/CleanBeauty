Dark circles are a cosmetic concern for many individuals, al-though not a medical concern. Moreover, clear definitions and possible causes of dark circ les have not been elucidated. This study reviews the possible causes and treatment options for dark circles based on a review of the medical literature and the authors’ clinical experience. Potential factors that contribute to dark circles include excessive pigmentation, shadowing due to tear troughs and infra-orbital fat hernia-
tion, shadowing due to infraorbital laxity and wrinkles, and thin, translucent skin overlying the orbicularis oculi muscle. Given the different possible causes for dark circles, ther-apeutic modalities must be indi vidualized for each patient. Because various factors cause dark circles, it is useful to iden-tify the underlying causes in order to select the appropriate treatment. (Ann Dermatol 30(5) 522 ∼528, 2018)-Keywords-Dark circles, Etiology, Infra-orbital darkness, Treatment optionsCosmetic problems that are ne ither health-threatening nor associated with significant morb idity but can affect an in-dividual’s emotional well-being are gaining increased attention. “Dark circles” is not a formal medical term, but a widely used term that coll ectively indicates symptoms of dark areas under the eyes. Visible dark circles make peo-ple look tired and can be a significant cosmetic concern1-3.
1-3.Many affected individuals seek treatment for dark circles, and this condition affects a wide range of ages, both sexes, and all races4. Despite the prevalence of this condition, there are few published articles on the mechanisms that underlie the conspicuous ness of dark circles5. In addition, there is no clear consensus about the pathomechanism and standard treatmen t of dark circles. Herein the authors introduce and review the possible causes of infraorbital dark circles and individuali zed treatment options depend-ing on the underlying cause, with a particular emphasis on injection methods. TYPES AND PATHOMECHANISMSPossible causative factors of infraorbital dark circles in-clude many exogenous and endogenous factors, such as anatomical differences, sex, genetic predisposition, aging, general physical condition, atop ic dermatitis, and dryness. There are several clinical causes of infraorbital dark cir-cles: excessive pigmentation, tear troughs; shadowing due
to infra-orbital fat herniation; thin, translucent skin over-lying the orbicularis oculi mu scle; running of the veins;
to infra-orbital fat herniation; thin, translucent skin over-lying the orbicularis oculi mu scle; running of the veins; and shadowing due to infraorbital laxity and wrinkles. Excessive pigmentation Infra-orbital dark circles are more common in patients with allergic conditions such as atopic dermatitis or aller-gic contact dermatitis (Fig. 1A). In these patients, peri-orbital dermatitis and pruritus -induced rubbing habits can

Dark circles under the eyes are often accom-panied by mouth breathing in children with allergic rhini-tis, which causes venous stasis  due to impedance of blood flow through the edematous nasal mucosa6. Post-purpuric pigmentation (PPP) after a cosmetic procedure is another cause of periorbital darkness (Fig. 1B). PPP as a type of
PIH is an acquired hypermela nosis induced by injury or cosmetic procedures, such as plastic surgery, lasers, or chemical peels, and it tends to affect dark-skinned people with greater frequency and severity.Tear troughsThere has been some debate regarding the contributing anatomy of tear trough deformity. Generally, the tear trough, also known as the nasojugal groove, is the natural depression extending inferolaterally from the medial can-thus, while the lid/cheek junction, or palpebromalar groove, extends around the lateral half of the inferior or-bit7. This concave, oblique groove can produce dark cir-cles and make people look tired and aged (Fig. 2).Infraorbital fat herniationInfraorbital fat herniation itself does not directly create dark circles. However, if the infraorbital fat protrudes, the tear trough become  deeper, and dark circles look worse (Fig. 3).Thin, translucent skin overlying the orbicularis oculi muscle
muscle Transparent eyelid skin allows visualization of the under-lying subcutaneous vascular pl exus or vasculature within the muscle.Presence of veinsRelatively large veins running below the eyes is another cause of dark circles.Wrinkles and laxity Wrinkles and laxity in infraorbital areas are other causes of dark circles and generally worsen with age (Fig. 4).TREATMENT OPTIONSDespite the great number of available medications and therapies to treat infraorbital dark circles, there are no evi-dence-based studies to support their use. Given the differ-ent possible causes of dark circles, therapeutic modalities must be individualized for each patient.
KY Park, et al524 Ann DermatolTopical treatments A variety of topical treatments can be used to treat derma-titis-related PIH or PPP with varying degrees of success. Topical treatment options include bleaching agents such as hydroquinone and tretinoi n and depigmenting agents such as albutin, an extract of  the bearberry plant. Topical corticosteroids, topical antioxidants including vitamin C and E, kojic acid, and azelaic acid also have been pre-scribed8. Lightening of hyperpigmented areas can be ach-ieved with one or more topical agents. Most topical agents can be effective but require a long period to achieve good results. In addition to long-term use, those agents can cause irritation or pruritus in some patients who apply them to the sensitive skin near the eyes. To overcome those disadvantages and increa se the penetration rate of active ingredients, a novel hyaluronic acid microneedle patch system with depigmen ting agents has been in-troduced9.
troduced9. Treatment with hyaluronic acid filler Currently, soft tissue augmentation with fillers is a widely accepted treatment for improving quality of life. This treat-ment can be used for correcting tear troughs, thin skin, and infraorbital wrinkles/laxity10. Dark circles due to tear troughs alone or tear troughs with infraorbital fat hernia-tion are the most common type of clinically important dark circles. We can treat these types of dark circles with hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers; HA fillers were well tolerated in the periorbital region in a long-term study11. 1. The selection of appropriate fillers for the correction of tear troughs Clinical experience and data have demonstrated that prod-uct choice and injection technique are critical features of safe and successful infraorbital ﬁlling12. Many fillers have recently been introduced, and selection criteria for fillers are diverse. Considerations when choosing fillers include:1) HA vs. non-HA fillers
1) HA vs. non-HA fillersFillers can be generally divided into HA or non-HA fillers. When considering the ease of  removal and possible side effects, it is appropriate to use HA fillers for tear troughs. 2) HA concentrationWhen manufacturers convey the concentration of a filler, they are articulating the total amount of HA found in the filler, typically expressed in mg/ml. Higher HA content in fillers tends to show better volumizing and retaining ef-fects13. However, when treating the infra-orbital area, an excessive volumizing effect can result in puffy eyes and make it difficult for physicians to carefully control the in-jection depth. Therefore, low-concentration HA fillers are recommended for correcting dark circles.3) Swelling ratioHA is hydrated extensively by  water at physiological pH. A HA gel’s capacity for swelling will vary from product to product and is dependent upon concentration, cross-link density, and the process used to hydrate the gel14,15.
Physicians should consider the swelling capacity of the fillers to be used, so that overcorrection can be prevented.4) Rheology (elasticity vs. viscosity)The rheology of HA fillers is very important for treating dark circles. It is convenient to use fillers with relatively low elasticity and viscosity for the correction of dark cir-cles16. 5) Particle sizeWhen characterizing the particle size of a HA gel, consid-eration must be given to the average particle size as well as the particle size distribution. Because larger gel par-ticles are more difficult to push through a small-bore nee-dle, a filler with a high average particle size will be more difficult to extrude14. It is important to control the size of the gel particles so as to reduce the extrusion force and re-lated side effects, such as bleeding and pain, when gels are administered17. We recommend choosing a filler with the smallest particles possible when treating infra-orbital areas.

17. We recommend choosing a filler with the smallest particles possible when treating infra-orbital areas. 2. Individualized filler treatment for tear troughs ‘Tear trough alone’-type dark circles are seen frequently in young people, in most of w hom dark circles can be im-proved by simply filling the tear trough. Tear troughs with prolapse of orbital fat due to aging can aggravate dark cir-cles by indirectly causing shadowing over the lower lids. These cases can also be improved by filler injection, ex-cept in severe cases of infraorbital fat herniation. In tear troughs with anteromedial cheek depressions, simulta-neous correction of both conditions can produce sat-isfactory results with regard to dark circles. Perfection of the midfacial arc allows for a brighter and younger look-ing face (Fig. 5).1) Filler techniques for tear troughs To fill tear troughs, HA filler is injected using the linear
thread method (three injections, 0.07 ml per injection). It is better to inject filler into the deep, submuscular layer to avoid a puffy appearance and the Tyndall phenomenon. The infraorbital area has be en empirically divided into

A small bolus HA injection using the depot technique can be given  at the point of the in-fraorbital area (5 small boluses, 0.02 ml per injection, 0.1 ml in total per side). 2) Filler techniques for infraorbital thin skin, laxity, and wrinkles When treating the infraorbital area with filler, physicians usually do not inject filler directly into the eyebag just be-neath the eyelashes because there is concern about un-naturally swollen-looking eyes. However, HA fillers can be used not only for correction of tear troughs, but also for
rejuvenation of eyebag areas (Fig. 7). It is possible for HA fillers to improve hydration, collagen synthesis, and the antioxidant effect, in addition to having a simple volumiz-ing effect. We suggest that dermal rejuvenation with HA fillers is appropriate for treating wrinkles, texture changes, and dyschromia of the eyebag areas18. Successful correc-tion of the lower eyelid depend s on patient se lection, pre-cise and consistent injectio n technique, and selection of appropriate filler material. In these cases, most light HA products such as RestylaneⓇ vital, BeloteroⓇ soft, and JuvedermⓇ volbella are recommended for use.Autologous fat transplantation Tear troughs and visualizatio n of the underlying vascula-ture within the muscle through thin and transparent lower eyelid skin can be improved by autologous fat trans-plantation. Fat transplantation is less likely to lead to a puf-fy appearance or the Tyndal l effect compared to filler
treatment. However, the procedure takes a longer time, edema can last for long periods, and removal is difficult. Platelet-rich plasma treatment for dark circles Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a concentration of plasma protein derived from a patient’s own blood that has been centrifuged to remove red blood cells. It has a significant concentration of growth fact ors, chemokines, and cyto-kines and has been used to  encourage various healing process. There has been a rece nt increase in the applica-tion of PRP in dermatology a nd aesthetic fields, including sound healing, fat grafting, alopecia, scar revision, and dermal volume augmentation19,20.PRP treatment is mainly effective for wrinkles, laxity, and secondary PIH-related dark circles. PRP can stimulate der-mal fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis21. Transforming growth factor- β1 and epidermal growth fac-tor in PRP are suggested to inhibit melanin production via
delayed extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation and inhibition of prostagandin- E2 expression/ tyrosinase enzyme activity, respectively22,23. In addition, PRP im-proves fat graft survival and can be used in combination with autologous fat grafts for dark circles24. For the treat-ment of dark circles, 0.01 ∼0.015 ml PRP is intradermally multi-injected with 30-gauge needles at a single point over each lower eyelid. Polynucleotide treatment for dark circles Intradermal long-chain polynucleotide (PN) filler injection

High-molecular weight chained PNs are thought to mediate their effects primarily through an increase in the metabolic activity of fibroblasts, which stimulate the secretion of collagen proteins and control the renewal of vari ous dermal components. PNs contribute to the regeneration of several key autologous components of the skin, such as glycosaminoglycans, pro-teins, glycoproteins, and fibrils, which help to maintain physiological function25,26. In a comparison study with HA fillers, PN fillers showed greater increases in skin elasticity
and collagen synthesis followed by fibroblast stimulation compared to HA filler groups with similar durability. PN fillers showed similarly good efficacy and safety in the cor-rection of crow’s feet in a clinical study27.In treating our patients, injection of a PN filler (RejuranⓇ; Pharmareasearch Products, Inc. , Seongnam, Korea) is per-formed intradermally with a 33-gauge nanoneedle using a serial puncture technique, with  injections placed approx-imately 1 cm apart over both infraorbital areas. The total dose is about 0.1 ∼0.5 ml for each side. Approximately 0.01∼0.02 ml of material is contained in each injection, and a total of 12 ∼24 points were injected into each in-fraorbital area. Lumps appear  immediately after treatment but usually disappear spontaneously after 1 ∼2 days. Fig. 8 shows improvement of dark circles with thin skin lack-ing elasticity after PN filler injection.Laser treatment for dark circles
Laser treatment for dark circlesLasers will resurface the skin and reduce or eliminate wrinkles and pigmentation, which improves the overall appearance of infraorbital dark  circles. Various lasers can be used for treatment of da rk circles. A low-fluence Q-switched 1,064-nm laser is safe and effective for dark circles with excessive pigmentation28. Fractional lasers and radiofrequency devices mi ght be suitable for dark cir-cles with loose and wrinkled skin29,30. Other reports have shown that 2790-nm Er:YSGG laser therapy might be ef-fectively and safely used for the treatment of infraorbital dark circles in atopic dermatitis patients31. In addition, a long-pulsed 1,064-nm neodymi um-doped yttrium alumi-num garnet laser can be used for the treatment of venous infraorbital dark circles and selectively minimizes visible prominent veins32,33. Improvement of dark circles by removing infraorbital fat padsTransconjunctival infraorbital fat resection and trans-
position can soften tear trough deformities and correct in-fraorbital fat herniation34. Laser-assisted transconjunctival lower lid blepharoplasty is also a safe and low-risk proce-dure that produces excellent cosmetic results in in-fraorbital fat pads35. Injectable phosphati dylcholine can be another option for infraorbital fat herniation that might benefit some patients who are considering blepharoplasty36; however, phosphatidylcholine is not approved in the United States for fat elimination. There are currently no Food and Drug Administration- approved injectable drugs for fat elimination37.
Treatment of Dark Circle by the EtiologiesVol. 30, No. 5, 2018 527CONCLUSIONBecause various factors cause dark circles, it is necessary to identify the cause before appropriate treatment can be initiated. Individual patients might have more than a sin-gle underlying cause, so physicians should be familiar with diverse treatment options and manage dark circles on a case-by-case basis. Treatment modalities range from top-ical agents to non-invasive treatments such as lasers to more invasive treatments such as volume augmentation with HA fillers or fat transplantation. Because filler in-jections in the infraorbital area can yield satisfactory results, we shared our experience. Dermatologists can choose the above-mentioned treatment options alone or in combina-tion to individualize treatment.ACKNOWLEDGMENTThis study was supported by a grant of the Korea Healthcare technology R&D Project, Ministary of Health & Welfare, Republic of  Korea (HN14C0095).CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
