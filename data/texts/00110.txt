Reactive Oxygen Species in HaCaT KeratinocytesAfter UVB Irradiation Are Triggered by IntracellularCa2þLevelsHitoshi Masaki1, Yukiko Izutsu1, Shoichi Yahagi1and Yuri Okano1It is recognized that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are responsible for skin damage due to UVB-radiation (UVB-R).However, the triggering substance(s) for ROS generation after UVB-R is uncertain with respect to the activationof NADPH oxidase (Nox), xanthine oxidase (XOD), and respiratory chain–chain reactions in mitochondria. As afirst step in identifying the trigger(s) for UVB-induced ROS generation, we examined the relationship betweenCa2þlevels and ROS generation in HaCaT keratinocytes. UVB-R exposure of HaCaT keratinocytes resulted in animmediate elevation of ROS that recurred 7 hours later. This was accompanied by immediately elevatedintracellular Ca2þ.AC a2þchelating agent, BAPTA, abolished the elevation of ROS after UVB-R completely. In
addition, exogenous H 2O2did not increase intracellular Ca2þlevels. This suggests that intracellular Ca2þis thefirst trigger for UVB-induced ROS generation.Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings (2009) 14,50–52; doi:10.1038/jidsymp.2009.12INTRODUCTIONUVB-R has high energy, which damages skin cells andcontributes strongly to skin tumor generation. In addition,UVB-R causes alterations in skin appearance, such as pigmentedspots and wrinkles, and it accelerates skin aging (which isdefined as photoaging). UVB-R damages DNA moleculesthrough photo-chemical reacti ons, and many studies performedin the past two decades have demonstrated the importance ofreactive oxygen species (ROS) to the acceleration of skin aging.However, there are no reports to date that elucidate how ROSgenerated after UVB-R are triggered. To prevent skin celldamage caused by ROS, characte rizing its first trigger and its
time-dependency process should be an important weapon. Thisstudy was conducted as a first approach to understanding theprocess by which skin cell damage is caused by ROS.RESULTSUVB-induced ROS in HaCaT keratinocytes are generated in adistinct manner over timeHaCaT keratinocytes showed a significant elevation in ROSimmediately after UVB-R exposure at a dose of 25 mJ cm/C02(Figure 1a and b). In addition, ROS generation immediatelyafter exposure exhibited dose-dependency (data not shown).The elevation in ROS then gradually declined up to 5 hourslater, after which further elevation was observed at 7 hours(Figure 1). This double-phasic curve indicates the existence ofdifferent stimuli for UVB-induced ROS generation.UVB-R increases intracellular Ca2þlevels in HaCaTkeratinocytes and ROS elevation caused by UVB-R is abolishedby a Ca2þ-chelating agentUVB-R caused an immediate elevation in intracellular Ca2þ,which was dose-dependent (Figure 2a). The elevation ofCa
2þcorrelated closely with ROS generation. To address thecontribution of Ca2þto ROS generation, we examined theeffect of BAPTA, a specific chelating agent for Ca2þ,(Chiancone et al ., 1986) on ROS generation immediatelyafter UVB-R exposure. BAPTA (25 mM) effectively suppressedROS elevation (Figure 2b). In addition, a Ca2þionophor,A23187, elevated ROS levels in HaCaT keratinocytes, whichwas associated with the increase in intracellular Ca2þlevels(data not shown). These results support the concept thatchanges in intracellular Ca2þconcentration contribute toUVB-induced generation of ROS.H2O2and exogenous ROS do not increase intracellular Ca2þconcentrations in HaCaT keratinocytesTo help confirm the contribution of Ca2þto UVB-inducedgeneration of ROS, we examined the effect of exogenousROS on intracellular Ca2þconcentrations. H 2O2did nothave any effect on intracellular Ca2þlevels (Figure 3). Theseresults indicate that elevated intracellular Ca2þconcentra-
tion in response to UVB-R occurs in advance of ROSgeneration.ORIGINAL ARTICLE

DISCUSSIONIt has been established that Ca2þfunctions as a critical signalfor various physiological responses, such as inflammation(Wang et al., 2000). In skin, intracellular Ca2þmodulates theterminal differentiation of keratinocytes. In addition, recentstudies have reported that Ca2þregulates skin barrierrecovery after disruption (Denda et al., 2002). These reportsindicate that Ca2þplays critical roles in physiologicalresponses of the epidermis.On the other hand, UV radiation has adverse effects on theskin, such as the formation of skin tumors and premature skinaging (Emerit, 1992; Moloney et al ., 1992). In particular,UVB-R frequently damages skin due to its high energycompared with UVA-R. UVB initiates various alterations inthe skin through DNA damage in the form of cyclobutanepyrimidine dimers, 6-4 photoadducts and in the generation ofROS (Wolf et al., 1993; Kim et al., 1995; Masaki et al., 1995).
One recent report demonstrated that the generation of ROSfrom UVA-R is due to NADPH oxidase, which is activatedthrough elevations in intracellular Ca2þconcentrations(Valencia and Kochevar, 2008).In our study, we found that UVB-R increases intracellularROS levels immediately after irradiation and also 7 hourslater. Because BAPTA, a specific Ca2þ-chelating agentcompletely abolished the elevation of ROS that occursimmediately after UVB-R exposure and because exposureto H2O2had no effect on intracellular Ca2þ, we concludethat UVB-induced generation of ROS immediately afterexposure is triggered by Ca2þ. In addition, we hypothesizethat the elevation in ROS 7 hours after UVB-R is alsoFluorescenceintensity/ μg protein(fold change of sham UVB-R) After UVB-R (hours)1 3570.01.02.03.04.05.0Immediatelyafter∗∗∗5 hours after 7 hours after Sham-UVB-R Immediatelyafter UVB-R∗∗∗Figure 1 .Time-dependent profile of intracellular ROS levels in HaCaT

regulated by Ca2þ. Several pro-inflammatory cytokines, suchas IL-1 aand TNF- a, are stored in cells as inactive forms. Forinstance, IL-1 ais converted by calpain, which requires Ca2þfor its proteolytic function (Kobayashi et al., 1990). Because ithas been reported that IL-1 ainduces ROS generation (Radekeet al ., 1990), we hypothesize the existence of a Ca2þ-triggering cascade for the UVB-R-induced generation of ROS.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterialsBAPTA-AM (1,2-bis-( O-aminophenoxy)-ethane- N,N,N0,N0-tetra-acetic acid, tetraacetoxymethyl ester), H 2DCFDA (2,7-dichlorodihy-drofluorescein diacetate), and Fura-2AM were purchased fromMolecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The BCA Protein Assay Reagentkit was purchased from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, IL). Bovineserum albumin was from Sigma (St Louis, MO), DMEM was obtainedfrom Nikken Bio Medical Laboratory (Kyoto, Japan) and fetal bovineserum was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).Cell culture

The UVB irradiance was measured using a UVlight meter UV-340 (Lutron, Coopersburg, PA).Measurement of intracellular ROSTwo assays were used to measure ROS. (1) Cells pre-loaded with20mMH2DCFDA for 30 minutes were exposed to UVB or H 2O2, andthen were lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100. The fluorescence intensityof each lysate was measured with excitation of 485 nm and emissionat 530 nm. Intracellular ROS are expressed as fold change of thefluorescence intensity normalized by mg protein against control cells.(2) Cells pre-loaded with 20 mMH2DCFDA for 30 minutes wereexposed to UVB or H 2O2. Cells were then observed immediately
