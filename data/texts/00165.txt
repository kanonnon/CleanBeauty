The effects ofdifferent outdoor environments,sunglasses and hats on light levels:implications for myopia prevention.Trans Vis Sci Tech. 2019;8(4):7,https://doi.org/10.1167/tvst.8.4.7Copyright 2019 The AuthorsPurpose: Lack of outdoor time is a known risk factor for myopia. Knowledge of thelight levels reaching the eye and exposure settings, including sun-protectivemeasures, is essential for outdoor programs and myopia. We evaluated the impactof sun-protective strategies (hat and sunglasses) on maintaining high illuminancelevels to prevent myopia.Methods: A child-sized mannequin head was developed to measure light illuminancelevels with and without sun-protective equipment, across a wide range ofenvironments in Singapore, outdoors (open park, under a tree, street) and indoors
(under a fluorescent illumination with window, under white LED-based lightingwithout window). A comparison was made between indoor and outdoor light levelsthat are experienced while children are involved in day-to-day activities.Results: Outdoor light levels were much higher (11,080–18,176 lux) than indoors(112–156 lux). The higher lux levels protective of myopia ( .1000 lux) weremeasured at the tree shade (5556–7876 lux) and with hat (4112–8156 lux).Sunglasses showed lux levels between 1792 and 6800 lux. Although with sunglassesreadings were lower than tree shade and hat, light levels were still 11 to 43 timeshigher than indoors.Conclusions: Recommendations on spending time outdoors for myopia preventionwith adequate sun protection should be provided while partaking in outdooractivities, including protection under shaded areas, wearing a hat or sunglasses,sunscreen, and adequate hydration.Translational Relevance: Light levels outdoors were higher than indoors and above
the threshold illuminance for myopia prevention even with adequate sun-protectivemeasures.IntroductionIncreasing time outdoors has been protectiveagainst myopia, delaying its onset in children.1–5Population-based studies report that children inAsian countries, especially of Chinese ethnicity, havehigher myopia prevalence compared to those inWestern countries.6The prevalence of myopia in 6-and 7-year-old children of Chinese ethnicity wassignificantly lower in Sydney (3.3 %) than in Singapore(29.1%), while patterns of daily outdoor lightexposure showed that children living in Singaporewere exposed to significantly less daily outdoor lightthan Australian children.7,8In Australian childrenaged 10 to 15 years, greater daily light exposure wasassociated with less ocular axial length over an 18-month period.9Studies in Taiwanese children also1 TVSTj2019 jVol. 8 jNo. 4 jArticle 7

showed that myopia progression can be diminished byincreasing outdoor time.3,4Exposure to outdoor lightled to less myopic shift, less axial elongation and a54%lower risk of rapid myopia progression.3Thesefindings support a role of light exposure in childhoodmyopia prevention. Combined with less outdooractivity, other factors, including increased indoorstudying, maternal myopia, and residing in an urbanregion, have been reported to be associated withlonger ocular axial length and myopia.10One hypothesis that explains why bright lightdecreases the risk of myopia development is anincreased release of dopamine, a neurotransmitterfound in the retina, that is responsible for retinalsignaling and can influence refractive development.11New evidence also implicates diurnal and circadianrhythms in eye growth and refractive error develop-ment.12The translatability of these research findings
in human populations remains unknown as humaneyes are anatomically different from animal models.Outdoor illuminance levels vary significantlydepending on weather, geographic location, andelevation, with illuminance levels reaching 130,000lux on a clear day to 15,000 lux under shaded orcloudy conditions.13Regardless, this is a starkcontrast to the typical indoor illuminances achievedthat are a few hundred lux.3,14High illuminancesoutdoors are protective against myopia in children,while excessive ultraviolet (UV) light may predisposethem to cataract, pterygia, and macular toxicity laterin adult life.15Countries, such as Singapore16andChina,1among others, are implementing outdooractivity programs to prevent myopia and protectivemeasures against sunlight damage must be accountedfor. To the best of our knowledge, no studies haveevaluated whether hats and sunglasses may diminish
the beneficial effects of outdoor time in the preventionof myopia. Thus, our objective was to evaluate theimpact of sun-protective strategies on maintaininghigh illuminance levels (measured in lux) to preventmyopia.MethodologyThe MannequinTwo bespoke child-sized mannequin heads ofchildren were designed to accurately record visiblelight illuminance levels incident on the human eye.Taking into consideration the structure of a children’sface, the optical sensors were embedded into the headand shielded by a brow ridge. The forehead, nose, andears were retained to enable the use of sun-protectionaccessories. The head model was mounted on a tripodstand, such that the height of the model was 137 cm torepresent the 50th percentile height of a 10-year-oldchild in Singapore.17The limitations of existing lightmeasurement systems make it challenging to measureincident illuminance levels on children’s eye, whilesimultaneously accommodating sun-protective equip-
ment, such as sunglasses and hats.The left and right eyes of the mannequin headaccommodated an AMS TSL45315 ambient lightsensor (AMS AG, Premstaetten, Austria). Theambient light sensor was selected because it closelymatched the photopic vision of the human eye, withdirect illuminance response in an ideal range of 3 to220,000 lux.18Two identical mannequin heads were manufac-tured. One head was designated as a control unit,while the other was designated as the measurementunit. To minimize error in data collection, readingswere recorded simultaneously from both mannequinsusing logging buttons. This minimized error from theday arc and its effects on the directionality of sunlight,as well as cloud variation. The control mannequinwas used to measure baseline light illuminance levels,whereas the other mannequin head measured lightlevels with adapted sun-protective measures ( Fig. 1 ).The protective eye measures included a hat and three

types of sunglasses, which were studied separately andin combination.When subjected to various outdoor lightingconditions, the ambient light readings from the twomannequins varied within 61%of each other. Thedifference was postulated to arise from manufacturingtolerances and sensor positioning, as the sensorscannot be placed exactly in the same location andwere placed side by side to record incident lightsimultaneously. However, the percentage differenceacross the two sensors was very small so sensors canbe regarded as identical within limits of experimentalaccuracy.The mannequin heads also were tested indoors,measuring light illuminance levels when facing awindow under a fluorescent lighting and withoutwindow under a cool white light-emitting diode(LED). These measurements were compared tooutdoor light illuminance levels, to evaluate thedifference between the two environments.Test EnvironmentsThree outdoors test environments were investigat-
Three outdoors test environments were investigat-ed, in an open field ( Fig. 2a ), street ( Fig. 2b ), andunder a tree ( Fig. 2c ) to comply with the mostcommon daily outdoor activities.The two mannequin heads were oriented south-ward, and light illuminance levels were measuredunder various combinations of test environments,with and without sun-protective equipment. Fourdifferent times of day were selected for conducting themeasurements (9 AM, and 12, 2, and 4 PM), eachrepresenting a different relative position of the sun.The measurements were made under cloudy orpartially cloudy environments, representing the mostcommon weather in Singapore. Two indoor environ-ments also were tested, in a room under a fluorescentlamp illumination and with natural light from awindow and a room under a cool withe LED withoutwindow.SunglassesThree different types of brown sunglasses wereused ranging from 8 %to 43%of transmission(transmittance in accordance with the international
standard ISO 12312-1:2013, Clause 519). There weretwo sunglasses with classic frame (Solar Class 2 and 3)and 1 with a wraparound frame (Solar Class 2). Themain benefit of the wraparound is to minimize backreflection of UV radiation, which forms an importantshare of the UV burden to the eye.15HatA baseball cap providing protection for forehead,cheeks, and nose was used for this study. This was asoft cap with rounded crown and a stiff peakprojecting in front ( Fig. 1 ). The hat was tested inthe different environments alone and in conjunctionwith sunglasses.Statistical AnalysisAll light illuminance levels values in lux werecollected from the mannequin, and data werepresented descriptively for each test situation andtiming. Microsoft Excel 2010 was used.ResultsOutdoor Versus IndoorOutdoor conditions in the open field environmentshowed much higher illuminance levels (11,080–18,176 lux) compared to indoors ( Fig. 3 ). Indoor
levels fluctuated from 112 to 156 lux under afluorescent lamp illumination and with natural lightfrom a window. The indoor lux levels under a coolLED without window were consistent at 112 lux at allfour timings of measurement (from 9 AM to 4 PM).Shade Provided by TreeFigure 3 compares the effect of shade provided bytrees (ranging from 5556–7876 lux) with typicallighting conditions at various times of the day in anopen field with cloudy conditions (ranging from11,080–18,176 lux) and indoor levels (112–156 lux).Tree shade provided at least 50 times more myopiaprotection with an increase in light illuminance levelscompared to the indoor measurements. Figure 4compares the typical street lighting conditions atvarious times of the day (ranging from 6604–16,320lux) with open field conditions and indoors.

The light levels with thesunglasses tested were approximately 11 to 43 timeshigher than the indoor environment. This variation3 TVSTj2019 jVol. 8 jNo. 4 jArticle 7Lanca et al.Downloaded from tvst.arvojournals.org on 09/26/2024
was attributed to the specifications of the sunglasses,with different lenses providing different sun glareprotection and luminous transmittance. However,even with sunglasses, the light levels remainedconsiderably higher ( /C211792 lux) compared to indoorlighting conditions (112–156 lux). The highest illumi-nance levels were achieved by the Solar class 2 lenses(wraparound, Fig. 5a , 4496–6800 lux; classic, Fig. 5c ,3952–6528 lux). The Solar Class 3 (classic, Fig. 5b ),with light levels ranging from 1792 to 5552 lux, alsowere able to display bright light, while maintainingoutdoor levels.HatThe effects of wearing a hat are shown in Figure 6(ranging from 4112–8156 lux), where the hat aloneFigure 2.

provided an increase between 26 to 52 times in lightilluminance levels, compared to indoor levels of 112to 156 lux. The baseball hat provided sufficient lightlevels for myopia prevention with maximum exposurelevels of 8156 lux at 2 PM.Hat and SunglassesWith hat and sunglasses, the light levels rangedfrom 952 to 1880 lux. Compared to indoors, lightlevels with hat and sunglasses were only 6 to 12 timesFigure 3. Light illuminance levels, comparing measurements in an open field, under a tree, and indoors.Figure 4. Light illuminance levels, comparing measurements in an open field, next to a street, and indoors.5 TVSTj2019 jVol. 8 jNo. 4 jArticle 7Lanca et al.Downloaded from tvst.arvojournals.org on 09/26/2024
higher. The large range in light illuminance with thehat alone was attributed to the directionality ofsunlight at different times of the day. The effect ofsunlight directionality on light illuminance levelsdiminished when wearing sunglasses. At 4 PMcombining the hat with glasses reduced the lightintensity exposure close to indoor values (952 lux).DiscussionSummaryOur study provided evidence that sun-protectivestrategies, such as tree shade (5556–7876 lux), hat(4112–8156 lux), and sunglasses (1792–6800 lux) canmaintain high potentially protective illuminance levelsfor myopia outdoors. Our results supported thepotential for interventions aimed at increasing aver-age daily light exposure to reduce the progression ofchildhood myopia, while engaging in sun-protectivemeasures that reduce UV levels to prevent futurecataract. The results also helped to improve ourunderstanding of the potential magnitude of theeffects of such measures on corneal illuminances.Outdoor Versus Indoor
Outdoor Versus IndoorLight recordings at the open field (11,080–18,176lux) were much higher compared to indoors (112–156lux). All indoor levels were below outdoors andcannot be considered protective from myopia. Even inthe room where there was natural light from awindow, the maximum lux level was only 156 lux.Different lighting between the rooms and presence/absence of a window does not seem to have asignificant impact on lux levels that remainedrelatively stable throughout the four timings ofmeasurement. This result might be similar in class-rooms at school even if windows are present, showingthat siting children next to a window does not provideenough light exposure against myopia. Althoughschools with large windows were evaluated previouslyfor myopia prevention, evidence that daylight inclassrooms prevents myopia is lacking.20The lux readings found indoor in our study werelower than the classroom readings in the Taiwanstudy (340 lux).3However, average light levels in
3However, average light levels inschool classrooms can vary widely between 138 and742 lux, as reported by a study in the United ArabEmirates.21Still, even the reported higher indoorreadings in classrooms were less than the threshold of1000 lux and do not have preventive myopiapotential. This topic warrants further research onlight levels in classroom indoor environments inSingapore and comparisons with other countries.Our findings of low levels of light intensity indoorsmust be further investigated, as a previous studyshowed that chickens raised under low-intensity levels(50 lux) had a deeper vitreous chamber depth and alonger axial length.22Further research is advised asFigure 5. Light illuminance levels, comparing measurements inan open field, with and without (a) solar Class 2 wrap-around, (b)solar Class 3 (classic), and (c) solar Class 2 (classic) sunglasses.6 TVSTj2019 jVol. 8 jNo. 4 jArticle 7Lanca et al.Downloaded from tvst.arvojournals.org on 09/26/2024
low intensity ambient light might be a risk factor formyopia.Shade Provided by TreeLight levels in shaded outdoor areas remainedconsiderably elevated (5556–7876 lux) and yielded agood potential for delaying the onset of myopia.Measurements under a tree shade showed that lightlevels were 50 times higher and potentially protectivefor myopia than indoor levels. This finding on theshade also is important for eye protection, reducingthe risk of side effects due to bright light exposure.According to Wu et al.,3outdoor activities withstrong sunlight exposure ( /C2110,000 lux) may not benecessary for myopia prevention and relatively loweroutdoor light intensities (1000–3000 lux or more) withlonger time outdoors, such as in hallways or undertrees, also can be considered. This finding iscorroborated by a significant reduction in the myopicshift in children with 200 minutes of outdoor timeexposure to /C211000 or /C213000 lux. Read et al.9also
confirm these findings reporting that children exposedto light levels .3000 lux per day had significantly lessaxial eye growth.The effect of trees reducing UV radiation, includ-ing the scattered individual trees in urban settings, iswell documented in the literature.23However, theeffect of tree shade on light levels is less known. Levelsabove 5000 lux can be achieved easily in conditions,such as in the hallway from a school or under theshade of a tree (5556–7876 lux) that are much higherthan indoors (112–156 lux), as shown in our study.Several benefits are provided by trees, including thereduced glare, blocking the diffused light from the skyand other surfaces, and contribution to control theambient temperature by blocking heat.24Street levels were higher than shade provided bytrees and light levels ranged from 6604 to 16,320 lux.Shade provided by the buildings at the street can
Shade provided by the buildings at the street canreach similar levels of the open field due to diffuselight and heat reflected from sunlit surfaces.24In arandomized clinical trial in Taiwan, children whospent 125 to 199 minutes outdoors showed significantless myopic shift if exposed to bright levels of 10,000lux or more.3Although, outdoor levels can reachmuch higher bright levels than measured in our study(maximum of 18,176 lux), the weather conditions maychange the light intensity as Singapore experiencescloudy conditions for 8.8 months in the year, withpartly cloudy conditions reaching 24 %of the timeduring March. Overcast conditions are present 76 %ofthe time during March and 91 %in December.25However, even with cloudy conditions, the light levelsoutdoors override the indoor levels, providing suffi-cient evidence for increasing outdoor exposure inSingaporean children.

SunglassesThe light levels measured with sunglasses wereapproximately 11 to 43 times higher than indoorenvironments. The sunglasses lenses tested were ableto produce an acceptable increase in bright lightcompared to indoors showing a potentially protectiveeffect against myopia. Sunglasses provided a verticalprotection barrier to the eyes and effectivenessdepends on geometry, lenses radiation transmittance,and exposure conditions.26The effect of sunglassesalone was not the same across different categories oflenses. Solar class 2 (wraparound and classic) lensesshowed higher readings of light levels. The Solar Class3 (classic) lenses drastically reduced outdoor illumi-nances at the eye level especially at 12 PM and 4 PM.These sunglasses are not advisable to be used bychildren outdoors as they limit the protective effect oflight for myopia prevention. Currently, there is noevidence whether wearing sunglasses hinders theprotective effect of bright light as the subject has
not been studied systematically. Our results supportthat children could be encouraged to spend more timeoutdoors with adequate UV protection, such assunglasses. A previous study reported that use ofsunglasses ranged from ‘‘never’’ to ‘‘half the time’’(median response was ‘‘never’’) in children 10 to 15years old and the use did not differ significantlybetween the myopic and nonmyopic children.9HatThe present study also showed that if a childspends time outdoors, using a hat, the light levelsoutdoors (4112–8156 lux) remained much higher thanindoors and, thus, may prevent the development ofmyopia. The hat alone provided an increase between26 to 52 times in light illuminance levels compared toindoors. A previous study found that the reportedfrequency of hat use when outdoors ranged from‘‘never’’ to ‘‘all the time’’ (median response was ‘‘lessthan half the time’’) and use did not differ signifi-cantly between the myopic and nonmyopic children.9
9Protection of children’s eyes from UV radiation isparticularly important, since UV transmittance ishigher at a very young age, allowing higher levels ofUV radiation to reach the crystalline lens and even theretina.15According to the American Academy ofPediatrics, clothing (including hats with brims) can bean excellent UV radiation barrier, because it offers asimple and practical means of sun protection.27Thewide-brimmed hats are more protective to the head,face, ears, and neck.28When using a baseball cap,sunscreen should be added to ears and neck.Hat and SunglassesLight levels with a combination of hat andsunglasses might be only borderline protective againstmyopia as exposure levels were between 952 and 1880lux. Exposures above 2000 lux were not measured andcombined use of hat and sunglasses cannot berecommended for myopia protection according toour findings. However, more research is needed toidentify the impact of combined sun-protectivemeasures on light levels.
measures on light levels.Advantages and LimitationsOne advantage of this study was the developmentof the child’s mannequin head and light sensor, whichwas able to measure illuminance ranges at the eyelevel. The use of the mannequin heads of childrenallowed accurate recordings of illuminance light levelsat a plane incident to the human eye, without theadvantage of exposing children to UV light in openfield conditions. A limitation was that light intensitylevels might have been different with different anglesof gaze, in other settings (e.g., school) and timings ofthe month due to monthly change in cloudyconditions in Singapore.Public Health ImplicationsBehavioral interventions can be of particularinterest for children with myopia, avoiding ordelaying the use of other treatment options with sideeffects, such as atropine and orthokeratology. As aguideline, children should engage in outdoor activitiesfor at least 2 to 3 hours per day and at least 14 to 21
hours per week. Less than 40 minutes per day of
guideline, children should engage in outdoor activitiesfor at least 2 to 3 hours per day and at least 14 to 21hours per week. Less than 40 minutes per day ofbright light exposure may predispose children tofaster axial eye growth.9Our results have important public health implica-tions for outdoor programs. Teachers, educators, andparents should stimulate children to be exposedoutdoors with shade, sunglasses, or hat protection.Approaches, such as that outlined here, may offer apractical alternative to delivering relatively high-intensity light exposures for longer periods of time,thus potentially effecting greater reductions in myopiarisk. Schools have a major role in influencing child-ren’s knowledge, attitudes, and behavior regardingoutdoor programs. Teachers can make a majorcontribution to myopia prevention, combining myo-pia prevention strategies with sun-protective measures8 TVSTj2019 jVol. 8 jNo. 4 jArticle 7Lanca et al.

during weekdays, especially in the course of recesstime, lunch breaks, and possible extend outdoorprograms further to curriculum hours. School-basedinitiatives outdoors can be conducted during assem-bly, regular classes, and physical education classes, asoccurs in Australian schools.8The availability of shade structures at schools anddaycare centers is likely to help in myopia preventionand reduce children’s UV radiation dose significantly.Parent and community involvement in healthy dualsun-protective practices during weekends is morelikely to take place if there is consistent informationand support from the family, school, and community.ConclusionExposure to light levels outdoors was considerablyhigher than indoors even while wearing sunglasses, ahat, or being in the shade. Children should beencouraged to spend more time outdoors while usingsun-protection measures to prevent myopia. Our resultscan facilitate public health efforts to encourage outdoor
activities and raise awareness about the importance ofsun protection measures to reduce UV damage whileincreasing protection against myopia onset.This work warrants further developments andstudies to test the effectiveness of sunglasses and hatsas protective measures in nationwide outdoor pro-grams to prevent myopia. The knowledge of lightexposure patterns achieved with sun-protective mea-sures can be a crucial factor in the design of outdoorprograms and needs further research.AcknowledgmentsSupported by Essilor R&D, Center for Innovationand Technology, Evaluation of the effect of sunglassprotection on light illuminance levels.Disclosure: C.
