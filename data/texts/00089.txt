Itscomposition is unique for the high percentage of long chain fatt y acids, and of the polyterpenoid squalene, absent in otherhuman tissues, and in non-human Primates sebum. Here, the still incomplete body of information on SSL as mediators ofexternal chemical, physical, and microbial signals and stressors is revised, focusing on the central event of the continuousoxidative modiﬁcation induced by the metabolic activity of residential and pathological microbial ﬂora, natural or iatrogenicUV irradiation, exposure to chemicals and cosmetics. Once a lpha-tocopherol and ubiquinol-10 antioxidant defences of SSLare overcome, oxidation of squalene and cholesterol gives rise t o reactive by-products penetr ating deeper into skin layers, to
mediate local defensive inﬂammatory, photo-protective, immune reactions or, at higher concentrations, inducing local but alsosystemic immune depression, ultimately implicating skin cancer ogenesis. Qualitative modiﬁcations of SSL represent a pathogeneticsign of diagnostic value in dermatological disorders involving altered sebum production, like pytiriasis versicolor, acne, atopicor seborrheic dermatitis, as well as photo-aging. Achievement s of nutriceutical interventions aimed at restoring normal SSLcomposition and homeostasis are discussed, as feasible therapeutic goals and major means of photo-protection.1. Sources and Composition ofSkin Surface LipidsA continuous hydrolipidic ﬁlm, representing the actual
interface between the epidermal viable layers and outerenvironment, covers human skin. Skin surface lipids (SSLs)are a mixture of sebaceous and epidermal lipids, displaying avery peculiar composition as compared to lipid fractions ofserum or internal tissues. This peculiarity is originated by theunique contribution of sebum secreted from the sebaceousglands, unevenly distributed in all areas of the body withthe exception of the palms and foot soles, and becomingextremely specialized in local districts, like the eye, where themeibomian glands exert highly e ﬃcient protective functions[1].SSL composition in the skin areas with the highestconcentration of sebaceous glands (forehead, upper chest,and dorsum) mainly reﬂects sebaceous secretion, ﬂowingfrom those sites also to areas with lower concentration, wherethe contribution of cellular lipid components, rich in oleicand linoleic acid, becomes more relevant [ 2,3]. The ker-
atinocyte membrane lipid contribution and the continuousmetabolic action of resident microbial ﬂora hosted at skinsurface in healthy conditions are key determinants of theuniqueness of this complex mixture. Major lipid componentsin human sebum include squalene (SQ—(2,6,10,15,19,23,-hexamethyl-2,6,10,14,18,22-tetracosahexaene), wax esters,and triglycerides. As a whole, the SSL fatty acids fractionis relatively poor in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).Typically, sebum is rich in long-chain fatty acids (up to
2 Mediators of Inﬂammation26 carbon atoms), linear or branched, mainly saturatedor monounsaturated [ 4,5]. These are partly present inthe free form, secondary to the microbial and epitheliallipase activity on sebum triglycerides, and are responsiblefor antimycotic and antibacterial properties of the skin[5–7]. For the most part, these specialized fatty acids areesteriﬁed with cholesterol, or with fatty alcohols, to formthe fraction of wax mono- and diesters, crucial for skininsulation [ 8–10], available uniquely on the skin and hairshaft. This fraction has been extensively investigated byanalytical lipidomic approach in recent years, allowing, forexample, the identiﬁcation of more than 160 di ﬀerent waxesters ranging from 24 to 42 total carbons, and 73 species ofceramides, in the human proximal hair [ 11,12].A most peculiar component of SSL is SQ [ 2], a key
biosynthetic precursor of cholesterol. In humans, about 60percent of dietary SQ is absorbed, transported in serum byvery low-density lipoproteins, and distributed ubiquitouslyin human tissues, with the greatest accumulation in theskin through sebocyte concentration [ 13]. SQ levels, beingnegligible in other organs, normally range about 12% oftotal SSL in adult life and can reach up to 20% [ 14,15].In the liver and in other tissues, this linear 30-carbontriterpenoid compound is entirely metabolised to SQ 2,3-epoxide to be subsequently converted to lanosterol. SQoverproduction in sebocytes may be due to altered expressionand activity of two key oxygen-regulated enzymes involvedin SQ metabolism, squalene synthase, and squalene oxido-cyclase, in response to the anaerobic environment occurringlocally inside the sebaceous gland [ 16]. This biochemicalpeculiarity bears important biological implications, in that
the peroxidable SQ molecule has been extensively provento be a key mediator of skin reactions to environmentalstressors [ 17].In defence towards oxidative events occurring on theskin, vitamin E of nutritional origin, actively secreted fromsebaceous glands and probably cosecreted with SQ [ 18]and coenzyme Q10of endogenous origin and partly co-synthesized with SQ by the sebaceous gland [ 19], providenecessary antioxidant protection to the skin lipid ﬁlm.The cellular-derived component of skin surface lipidsconsists of phospholipids derived from the plasma mem-brane of corneocytes, also contributing as the uniquecomponent of ceramides characterizing cell envelope [ 7,20].Lipids from keratinizing cells account for the rather limitedcontribution of polyunsaturated fatty acids, namely linoleicacid [ 21], available in the surface hydrophobic ﬁlm. More
deeply into the corniﬁed envelope, ceramides and proteinsconcur to form the unique intercellular matrix determiningmost of the functions of the skin barrier [ 22].The overall composition of SSL di ﬀers therefore sen-sibly from lipids of the viable skin epithelial layers, andfrom systemic lipids, both in the relative percentage andtype of lipid fractions, and in the relative amount of thePUFA oxidable fraction [ 16]. Following the rather extensivestudies on the composition and role of SSL started bythe pioneer observations of Nicolaides [ 10], the researchon epidermal surface lipids and their prevalent sebaceouscomponent has been thereafter almost entirely dropped,in favour of the studies on lipids of keratinocyte origin,thus unravelling the essential functions of ceramides in cellsignalling and skin disease [ 23,24]. Nevertheless, the roleof SSL in mediating the biologic e ﬀects of UV irradiation
and other environmental stimuli/stressors has been at leastpartly identiﬁed [ 25], and, most importantly, alterationsin sebum secretion have been recognised as a commonfeature of several inﬂammatory chronic skin diseases, ﬁndingtheir main localization in cutaneous areas where sebaceousglands are more concentrated. In addition, SSL chemicalcomposition can be severely altered in di ﬀerent skin diseases.
This is the case of acne [ 26–28], atopic [ 29] and seborrheicdermatitis [ 30], pityriasis versicolor [ 31,32], and androgenicalopecia [ 33]. Sebum must in fact also be regarded asvehicle transporting and transmitting several endogenousand exogenous molecules to the skin, including potentialregulatory factors of hair follicles [ 34].All the above-mentioned dermatoses are so far lackingsatisfactory aetiopathogenic elucidation and consequentlyestablished and e ﬀective therapies. Interestingly, all of thembeneﬁt from therapeutic UV irradiation protocols [ 35].2. Effects on SSL of Natural UV Irradiation andPhototherapyAmong the di ﬀerent categories of environmental stressorsaﬀecting the skin, UV irradiation is the ﬁeld of most intenseresearch targeting the increased risk of tumor developmentconnected with overexposure and the e ﬀects on cutaneouspigmentation of medical/aesthetic concern. Based on thecapability of UV rays to penetrate at di ﬀerent depths in
the epidermal and dermal layers [ 36], most of the studieshave been so far focused on the photoreceptors localisedin the skin viable compartments beneath corneum, suchas DNA, urocanic acid [ 37], and endogenous [ 38]o rbacterial porphyrins [ 39]. These molecules are able toselectively absorb in the UV wavelenght range and thuscatalyse oxidative cytostatic, cytotoxic, or imunomodulatingphotoreactions, widely employed for medical applications inskin phototherapy.Indeed, the very ﬁrst target of UV and other environ-mental radiations during natural, professional, or thera-peutic exposure is represented by skin surface lipids [ 40].Nevertheless, their possible role as mediators of cutaneousand systemic biological e ﬀects has been so far not ade-quately highlighted. The UV-R absorbance spectrum for
SSL has been assessed spectrometrically, showing signiﬁcantabsorption, with a maximum at 215 nm. The hydrolipidlayer present on forehead skin in healthy conditions islikely to reduce transmission at 300 nm by about 10%[41]. Apart from representing a ﬁrst line of defence bydirect UV absorption, SSL constitutes a suitable target andscavenger for all reactive species generated at skin levelby di ﬀerent molecular mechanisms, in the course of UVirradiation. This indirect photo-oxidation is deﬁnitely themost relevant biological e ﬀect of UV on the SSL mantel andis the main mechanism operating in ultraviolet A- (UV A-)and visible light-induced photodynamic stress induced on

Mediators of Inﬂammation 3skin for therapeutical purposes [ 42]. Due to the scavengingaction of SSL under atmospheric oxidative chemical stress,photoirradiation, or microbial oxidative metabolism, thehydrolipid superﬁcial mantel becomes a relevant source ofperoxidated intermediates on the skin, certain molecules ofthe resulting composition being clearly cytotoxic, irritant, orimmunogenic [ 34].Among cutaneous SSL components, squalene is amost intriguing component. It represents indeed the mostabundant peroxidable fraction in SSL. It was previouslydemonstrated that when human sebum is subjected tohigh-dosage UVB irradiation in vitro ,S Qi sm a r k e d l ydegraded as compared to cholesterol, sebum triglycerides,or mono-/diunsaturated free fatty acids (FFAs) [ 43,44].
UVR, alone or in combination with photosensitizers or otherphysicochemical stimuli including microbial peroxidizingmetabolism, induces oxidative degradation of SQ with thegeneration of a wide range of by-products of varying polarityand reactivity, that have been clearly characterised by ionmass spectrometry. These include SQ monohydroperoxide[43], di ﬀerent isomers of squalene epoxide, and shorterchain reactive aldehydes [ 45], in particular formaldehydeand malonyl dialdehyde (MDA) [ 46–48] ] (Figure 1). Morerecent studies have demonstrated that SQ is oxidized at amuch higher rate in physiological conditions by UV A eitherthan UVB, and that probably most previous results obtainedwith experimental UVB irradiation must be ascribed to theeﬀects of minimal doses of UV A, always contaminating UVBemission sources [ 49].Following the initial studies concentrated on SQ oxi-dation dynamic, conclusive works have indicated that thevery ﬁrst molecules undergoing oxidation in vivo under UV
irradiation of skin are alpha-tocopherol and ubiquinol-10,both in sebum and viable keratinocyte membranes [ 17,19,50–52]. These redox-cycling phenols have been undoubtedlyrecognised as the ﬁrst targets of UV oxidation in boththree-dimensional skin experimental models [ 50,51]o rcell-free sets of sebum ex vivo irradiation [ 53,54]. Onlyonce these borderline lipophilic antioxidant defences ofSSL are overcome, there occurs accelerated SQ oxidation;this leaves unchanged the remaining lipid fractions andprotects other unsaturated lipids such as cholesterol and,most importantly, the minimal amount of PUFA contributedby pure sebum, namely sebaleic acid (5,8-octadecadienoicacid). This special di-unsaturated fatty acid has been recentlyproven in vitro to be a feasible source of oxidized, biologicallyactive chemoattractant and proinﬂammatory species, whenmetabolized by neutrophils and keratinocytes in the skin[55].In vivo instead, the protective e ﬀect of SQ on PUFA
and the major physiological relevance of SQ peroxidesas compared to sebaleic acid oxometabolites were alreadyindirectly proven by the early observations of Morello et al.[56], documenting the absence of signiﬁcant sebaleic aciddepletion in sebum of patients with severe acne, as comparedto healthy controls.Based on the elevated proneness of SQ to photodecom-position, and the many biological e ﬀects of UV-induced SQperoxides it has been recently reproposed that these reac-tive by-products may be principal physiological molecularmediators of the biological e ﬀects of UV irradiation andother pro-oxidants targeting skin [ 39].As described above, the protective e ﬀects of SQ arecounterbalanced by the generation, by the same peroxidativemode, of low-molecular weight and relatively hydrosolu-ble reactive species [ 57,58], chemically derived from theantioxidant action of the triterpene. These by-productsa r ea b l et od iﬀuse from the skin outer corneum mantel

into viable layers and hence target keratinocyte plasmamembrane PUFA, thereby causing arachidonic acid decreaseand a sequel of consequent biological e ﬀects, includingthe production of a cascade of lipid oxidation reactivenucleophiles, such as 4-hydroxy-2 nonenal (4-HNE). SQperoxides display the typical bimodal biological behaviorof reactive species, exerting in vitro a paradoxical e ﬀect onkeratinocyte cells. At low concentrations and short times ofincubation, they stimulate DNA and protein synthesis, whilstinducing cellular damage and inhibiting mitotic activity athigher exposure times and dosages [ 44]. SQ peroxides alsostimulate keratinocytes to release increased amounts of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines in vitro [59] whereas they induceUV-like immunologic e ﬀects on the guinea pig ear model invivo. T opical application in concentrations likely produced
under physiological UV irradiation of the skin is in factable to suppress contact hypersensitivity to topically appliedhaptens like dinitroﬂuorobenzene (DNFB), as demonstratedby the reduction of lymphocyte inﬁltrate and the depletionof ATPase positive immunocompetent cells [ 53].Among SSL fractions, SQ is the most e ﬃcient quencherof singlet oxygen [ 60], produced under UV irradiationof cutaneous photo-sensitizers or under conditions ofphagocyte-driven oxidative burst at skin inﬂammation sites[39]. SQ peroxide by-products generated by this scavengingaction are able to upregulate the release of PGE and cytokinesfrom keratinocytes [ 59], and through this mechanismthey possibly activate melanocyte dendricity and stimulatemelanin synthesis in the lower skin layers, as demonstratedon the guinea pig ear model [ 39]. In this direction, SQperoxide e ﬀects on melanogenesis can in part explain alsochanges in skin pigmentation in vivo .
changes in skin pigmentation in vivo .T aken together, all these results conﬁrm earlier classiﬁ-cation of SQ as a sacriﬁcial antioxidant, being extensivelydegraded under di ﬀerent types of peroxidant stimuli andvery prone to photodecomposition [ 61]. This way, thisunique molecule is able to a ﬀord protection of human skinsurface from further damage to the lipid mantel and tocellular peroxidable targets of the viable layers, induced bythe exposure to UV and other sources of ionizing radiation,both natural and iatrogenic. In view of the many ascertainedbiological e ﬀects of UV-induced SQ peroxides, it has beenrecently re-proposed that these reactive by-products may beprincipal physiological molecular mediators of the biologicaleﬀects of UV irradiation and other pro-oxidants targetingskin [ 39,62].The recognition of SQ as a principle target for oxidative
stressors on the hydrolipid mantle has been acknowledgedin the last decade also for applicative purposes, in that thequantiﬁcation of SQ oxidative rate, or of SQ hydroperoxideformation, has become a commonly used method to test 4792, 2010, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2010/321494 by Cochrane Japan, Wiley Online Library on [26/09/2024].

On the basisof all described biochemical properties, it can be sensiblyhypothesized that the natural deﬁciency of squalene oxido-cyclase activity in human sebaceous glands represents an
evolutionary advantage, in that SQ is capable of neutralizingreactive oxygen species induced by UV irradiation on theskin, thus behaving as an antioxidant and, indirectly (SQdoes not absorb in the UV range), as a natural sunscreen[64]. The skin of monkeys, unlike that of humans, is coveredby a large quantity of hair, protecting from UV rays. In thefar less hairy human skin, the shield function is reasonablycarried out by SQ, in association with the physical defencesof stratum corneum and melanin. In contrast to humansebum in fact, SSL of other hominidae contains higher levelsof cholesterol, and surprisingly no SQ at all. Our group hasperformed a so far unique study on surface lipid compositionin the primate superfamily, proving that SQ is unique tohuman sebum, and completely missing in the main generaof non-human primates, including those closer to man, thehominoidea [65,66]. Human sebum also contains higher
levels of triglycerides and their hydrolysis products and farlower levels of cholesterol. A synthesis of most relevant datais illustrated in Figure 2and T able 1. In addition, SQ terpenetypical of human sebum is also a principal surface lipid ofdiﬀerent aquatic mammals, namely otter, beaver, kinkajou,and at least one species of mole [ 67–70]. In these species,SQ accounts for the essential properties of water repellenceand thermal insulation. Other nonaquatic mammals or birdshave evolved di ﬀerent cutaneous fats, such as wax esters andwax di-esters, ensuring the same vital properties.The relevant distance of human sebum in compositionand function from the nearest primates, and the closesimilarity with semiaquatic mammals, bears interestingevolutionary implications and may o ﬀer some support to the
discussed hypothesis of the origin of man from some semi-aquatic hominids, feeding on ﬁsh. Marine food, especiallymicroalgae and seaweeds, as well edible seeds of plantsdwelling in Mangrovian habitats, like the genus Amarantus[71], display in fact an unusual rich SQ content. In the lightof the so-called Aquatic Ape Theory, that evidences featuresof convergence among di ﬀerent semi-aquatic species, suchas proboscis monkeys, beavers, sea-otters, hippopotamuses,seals, sea lions, and walruses [ 72], these new biochemicaldata on human sebum squalene o ﬀer indeed new space forspeculation.3. Microbial Impact on SSL Composition andFunctionAs previously mentioned, the epidermal surface hydrolipidlayer can also be viewed as the growing medium forresidential saprophytic microbial skin ﬂora.

6 Mediators of Inﬂammationand density of bacterial and yeast population at cutaneoussurface is dependent on host age and on environmentalfactors such as sebum secretion, occlusion, temperature,and humidity [ 73,74]. Sebum produced in the pilo-sebaceous gland is composed purely of squalene, waxes, andtriglycerides [ 34] .O n c es e c r e t e d ,t h i sr i c hm e d i u mi si m m e -diately colonized by various lipotrophic biologic agents, thedevelopment of which is controlled by several defensivehumoral mechanisms and by the contact with ambientoxygen. Bacterial/yeast lipase activity is the main responsibleof FFA presence on the skin. Oxygen and micro-organismstransform sebaceous moiety and hydrolyse triglycerides toFFA, with consequent relevant alterations of the SSL patternin cases of pathological microbial colonization of the skin.This is the case of acne, where a role for Propionibac-terium infection is claimed among the main aetiopathogenic
triggers [ 75]. Here, FFAs metabolically generated by thislipophilic bacterium account for the chronic inﬂammatoryreaction and the ﬁbrogenetic action on infundibulum epithe-lium, thus sustaining comedones, pustules, and nodulesformation [ 27]. Similar mechanisms have been claimed toexplain at least partially the chronic inﬂammatory processcharacterizing atopic (AD) and seborrheic dermatitis (SD)[76,77].Pityrosporum ovale is a lipophilic saprophytebelonging to the normal skin ﬂora, mainly localizing in thehorny layers, and in the upper tract of the sebaceous follicle.In the scalp, for instance, P. o v a l e constitutes up to 46%of the cutaneous ﬂora in the healthy subject, while it mayincrease up to 82% in SD patients. The evidences of defectivecell-mediated response to P. o v a l e and to Candida albicansin SD patients [ 78], and the elevated incidence of SD inHIV+and AIDS patients [ 79], support the hypothesis that
a deﬁcit of cell-mediated immunity may play an aetiologicalrole in the disease. A long-lasting pro-inﬂammatory actionofP. o v a l e is to be taken into account, the yeast beinghighly immunogenic, able to activate complement and toproduce pro-inﬂammatory reactive oxidized metabolites ofselected polyunsaturated SSL, including SQ [ 34]. Alterationsof SSL composition, along with oxidative by-products of SSLirradiation during antitumor PUV A or narrow-band UV-B phototherapy, induce similar immunologic impairmentlocally on skin. This causes an increased incidence ofparasite skin colonization, like, for example, the infectioncaused by the Demodex mite [ 80], an intrafollicular parasitefeeding on sebum, and also frequently causing blepharitis[34].Antimicrobials may reduce the density of the resident
pathogenic or saprophytic skin ﬂora, but they do not com-pletely eliminate it. While antimicrobials may cause irritantand allergic contact dermatitis, no evidence exists that theiruse may change the ecology of resident bacteria on the skin,thereby leading to the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria[74]. As a consequence, antibiotic/antimycotic treatment isnot the elective approach to most of these skin diseases.The antimicrobial function of FFA generated on sebum isan essential factor for the homeostasis of skin microbialcolonies, and changes in sebum fatty acid composition area main cause of microbial alterations on the pathologicalskin [ 81,82]. In this respect, skin lipidomics are deﬁnitelyexpected to o ﬀer important diagnostic and therapeuticsolutions in the near future.Due to its high levels of unsaturation, SQ in particular
has been proposed as the precursor of highly toxic pro-inﬂammatory mediators, produced by bacterial or yeastlipoperoxidase activity [ 45]. A further well-characterizedexample of an aetiologic involvement of SSL in skin pathol-ogy is o ﬀered by pityriasis versicolor, a pigmentation diseasefeatured by large achromial spots occurring on skin areaswith highest concentration of sebum lipids, where Pityrospo-
ogy is o ﬀered by pityriasis versicolor, a pigmentation diseasefeatured by large achromial spots occurring on skin areaswith highest concentration of sebum lipids, where Pityrospo-rum orbiculare ﬁnds optimal dwelling conditions. This skinsaprophyte in some individuals becomes pathogenic, dueto still unknown factors. In vitro cultures of P . orbicularehave documented a markedly increased peroxisomal lipidoxidation activity induced by the same unsaturated fattyacids present on the skin, namely linoleic acid [ 83], givingrise to hydrogen peroxide through a Fenton mechanism andthe subsequent generation of hydroxyl radicals. SQ, whichis not a substrate for lipoxygenase and is not metabolizedbyPityrosporum , may reasonably be peroxidized in vivo dueto the metabolic activities of yeast peroxisomes. In yeastcultures supplemented with linoleic acid plus SQ, a markedincrease in lipoperoxide formation was observed [ 83], with
the generation of the same toxic and unstable oxidationproducts (trans-trans farnesal and SQ epoxides) formedunder experimental high-dosage UV irradiation of sebumand also identiﬁed on skin in vivo [45].This equivalence substantiates the role of SQ peroxidesin the development of the clinical features of pityriasis,possibly accounting for melanotoxicity and cutaneous depig-mentation [ 84]. In this connection, the early demonstrationthat vitamin E supplementation suppresses the inductionof peroxisomal beta-oxidation and catalase activity inducedby linoleic acid o ﬀers promising clues for new treatmentapproaches [ 85].4. Skin Surface Lipids as Biomarkers of SkinDisease and AgingAll surface lipids examined so far play a role in the complex
signaling network originating at the epidermal level, so thatskin can no more be viewed as a specialized wrappingmaterial protecting internal organs from environment andguaranteeing the main function of permeability barrierhomeostasis, but more extensively as a complex organactively communicating with the external world [ 86]. Asa consequence, thorough revision has been made of thetraditional concept that only mere quantitative alterationsof sebum, without any concern for sebum quality andcomposition, accounted for skin diseases associated withseborrhea or sebostasis. The multifaceted functions of thesebaceous gland are hence gaining momentum [ 25,87], asthe dysfunction of enzymes synthesizing or metabolizingSSL has been found in di ﬀerent disease states, along with
altered sebum antioxidant levels. As widely discussed above,SSLs are subjected to hydrolysis and oxidative processes,giving rise to biologically active by-products, which arecritically modulated by local lipid soluble antioxidant levels, 4792, 2010, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2010/321494 by Cochrane Japan, Wiley Online Library on [26/09/2024].

Indeed, SSL composition has been foundsigniﬁcantly altered in amount and quality in di ﬀerent skindiseases as well as in the aged skin.In both atopic and seborrheic dermatitis, we and otherauthors reported a marked reduction of skin total surfacelipids [ 29,30]. It was shown that SSL of children and adultswith atopic dermatitis present depleted levels of the lipidfractions of sebaceous origin, SQ, and wax esters and corre-spondingly increased levels of free and esteriﬁed cholesterol.Analogous alterations were found in seborrheic dermatitis,in HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients, these lattersuﬀering from SD with increased frequency as compared to
healthy population. These alterations of SSL composition,summarized in T able 2, were associated with signiﬁcantsystemic depletion of the main lipophilic antioxidant levelsand detoxifying enzymatic activities, mainly vitamin E,ubiquinol-10, and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase [ 88,89].In the acne pathogenic process, SQ peroxides most likelyplay a role [ 90], in that SQ monohydroperoxide has beenproven to be highly comedogenic when topically applied onskin in the animal model [ 91]. Sebum SQ fraction was foundincreased by 2.2-fold in a group of patients a ﬀected withmoderate to severe acne, as compared to controls, reaching20% of the total sebaceous lipids [ 92]. The SSLs undergoimportant qualitative and quantitative modiﬁcations dueto photo-aging, where SQ peroxides seem again to play amajor role, mimicking the e ﬀects of chronic UV irradiationwhen applied experimentally on the skin [ 93,94]. SSL mayhence represent a very e ﬃcient marker of the sun-protecting
eﬃcacy of chemical sunscreens. Experimental UV irradiationof a series of commercial chemical ﬁlters in the presenceof SQ in physiological concentrations led to the conclusionthat all most common UV ﬁlters protect SQ from UVB-driven oxidation at di ﬀerent extents (Benzophenone-3 >Octylsalicylate >Parsol MCX >Parsol5000 >Octyldimethylp-hydroxybenzoic acid (PABA) >Parsol 1789), dependingon ﬁlter dose and irradiation energy. Conversely, uponUV A irradiation, ﬁlters like Parsol 1789 and 5000 andoctyl-dimethyl PABA exerted a marked pro-oxidant e ﬀect,enhancing SQ peroxides formation possibly through theaction of their self-decomposition by-products induced byUV A, deserving careful attention for safety concerns [ 64,95].The external lipid ﬁlm hence represents a reliable invivo marker of skin disease, easy to monitor throughnoninvasive analytical techniques [ 30,96]. Being the ﬁrst
target of environmental stressors, SSLs also represent asuitable research tool for in vitro screening, to study drugdelivery through skin, as well as in vitro assessment of the
target of environmental stressors, SSLs also represent asuitable research tool for in vitro screening, to study drugdelivery through skin, as well as in vitro assessment of thechemical reactions of jewellery, textiles, cosmetics, drugs,industrial chemicals, and particles in direct and prolongedcontact with human skin [ 97]. T o provide meaningful results,the composition of artiﬁcial SSL should accurately mimichuman sweat and sebum, and the conditions of the in vitrotest system should accurately reﬂect in vivo skin conditions.The wealth of results obtained employing artiﬁcial sebumformulations is characterized by the poor physiologicalvalue of most models, lacking essential components andpresenting unrealistic percent ratios of the single molecules.Variables like sweat composition, pH, temperature, and soforth need careful standardization, in order to guaranteereliability of the in vitro test system. The combination oftridimensional skin tissue models with SSL formulations
bears promising results for in vitro applications, providingboth corneum and sebum components to the skin barrierfunctional model.5.

8 Mediators of Inﬂammationrepresent a powerful approach to enhance skin photo-protection, to prevent skin ageing, and to control microbialsymbiotic and pathogenic colonization and consequentskin diseases. This goal is attempted traditionally throughlocal application of lipid and/or lipophilic antioxidant-enriched cosmeceutical formulations, with immediate ben-eﬁcial e ﬀects, albeit in most cases not durable after treatmentdiscontinuation.The possibility to control SSL composition and skinfunction in general by diet or nutriceutical interventionis far more intriguing and promising a perspective. Theadministration of skin-tropic lipid-based oral supplementshas been claimed to be e ﬀective, though available reportsare sparse [ 98,99]. The analysis of the existing literaturebrings to the conclusion that nutritional factors providebeneﬁts to skin physiology, but information on the e ﬀects
of low-to-moderate doses of nutrients consumed in thelong term by healthy individuals is lacking, as well as arethe data on the direct e ﬀects on basal skin properties,including hydration, sebum production, and elasticity, up-to-date scant, and often contradictory. The largest part ofinformation refers to PUFA administration as a treatmentfor scaly skin, the observation that the formation of PUFAoxidation products on the skin can be suppressed by linoleicacid supplementation through vegetable oil sources [ 21]demonstrates that skin lipid ﬁlm can be modulated throughthe diet more e ﬃciently that through topical application .A low-glycaemic diet regimen also proved e ﬀective in thenormalization of sebum production and composition in acnepatients, conﬁrming the feasibility of the control of diseaseconcurrent factors inﬂuencing sebaceous gland physiologythrough the systemic approach [ 100].Concerning antioxidant supplementation, Passi et al.
[54] reported no signiﬁcant alteration of SSL after a daily oraldosage 200 mg of CoQ10for 10 days. Oral supplementationof SQ to mice resulted in a marked dose-dependent upreg-ulation of cellular and nonspeciﬁc immune functions [ 13].In healthy volunteers, low- or high-dosage (13 or 27 g daily)SQ per os ,per 90 days resulted in signiﬁcant improvementof antiaging e ﬀects on photoaged skin, with facial wrinkledecrease, as conﬁrmed by molecular markers of UV-inducedskin damage. Facial erythema decrease and pigmentationincrease were observed though high dose oral administrationof fat induced some side e ﬀects [ 101].6. ConclusionsData discussed so far allow us to consider skin surface lipids,
and in particular its polyunsaturated component squalene,as a main target for pro-oxidant agents on the skin. SQperoxides generated locally upon natural or therapeutic UVirradiation are mediators of the immunological response andthe melanogenic process in the skin. The SSLs represent suit-able markers for the diagnosis of skin disease or aging, andfor treatment e ﬃcacy monitoring, provided that the resultsare combined with the analysis of the strictly interconnectedsystemic biomarkers of oxidative damage and antioxidantdefences.AbbreviationsAD: Atopic dermatitisDNFB: DinitroﬂuorobenzeneFFA: Free fatty acids4-HNE: 4-hydroxy-2 nonenalMDA: Malonyl dialdehydePABA: Para-hydroxybenzoic acidPUFA: Polyunsaturated fatty acidsSD: Seborrheic dermatitisSQ: SqualeneSSL: Skin surface lipids.Acknowledgments
