Effects of Infrared Radiation and Heat on Human SkinAging in vivoSoyun Cho1,2,3, Mi Hee Shin1,2,3, Yeon Kyung Kim1,2,3, Jo-Eun Seo1,2,3, Young Mee Lee1,2,3,Chi-Hyun Park1,2,3and Jin Ho Chung1,2,3Sunlight damages human skin, resulting in a wrinkledappearance. Since natural sunlight is polychromatic,its ultimate effects on the human skin are the result ofnot only the action of each wavelength separately, butalso interactions among the many wavelengths,including UV, visible light, and infrared (IR). In directsunlight, the temperature of human skin rises toabout 40 1C following the conversion of absorbed IRinto heat. So far, our knowledge of the effects of IRradiation or heat on skin aging is limited. Recent workdemonstrates that IR and heat exposure each inducescutaneous angiogenesis and inflammatory cellularinfiltration, disrupts the dermal extracellular matrixby inducing matrix metalloproteinases, and alters
by inducing matrix metalloproteinases, and altersdermal structural proteins, thereby adding to pre-mature skin aging. This review provides a summary ofcurrent research on the effects of IR radiation andheat on aging in human skinin vivo .Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings (2009) 14,15–19; doi:10.1038/jidsymp.2009.7INTRODUCTIONInfrared (IR) radiation consists of wavelengths from 760 nm to1 mm, and it is subdivided into three regions of increasingwavelength, IR-A (760–1400 nm), IR-B (1400–3000 nm), andIR-C (3000 nm–1 mm). Given that almost half of the solarenergy reaching the earth’s surface is in the IR range, solar IRis expected to have significant biological effects on humanskin.Heat is a form of energy that may be transmitted by IRradiation, which results in raised skin temperature. Humanskin is exposed daily to natural sunlight. We found that thetemperature of human skin can increase to more than 40 1C
under direct IR irradiation (Lee et al ., 2006) due to theconversion of IR into heat. There is clinical evidenceindicating that chronic heat exposure of human skin maycause alterations. The skin disease called erythema ab igne isknown to be caused by chronic heat exposure. It ischaracterized clinically by reticular pigmentation of the skinand histologically by the presence of solar elastosis in thedermis similar to what is seen in photoaged skin. Further-more, severe skin aging may develop occasionally on bakers’arms, because of exposure to hot ovens, and on the faces ofglass blowers.However, the effects of IR radiation and heat on cutaneousaging are still largely unknown. This review provides anoverview of the current knowledge of contributions of IRradiation and heat exposure to aging in human skin.EFFECTS OF IR RADIATION ON AGING IN HUMAN SKIN
EFFECTS OF IR RADIATION ON AGING IN HUMAN SKININ VIVOIt has been reported that IR-A can penetrate epidermal anddermal layers and reach subcutaneous tissues withoutincreasing the skin temperature significantly, whereas IR-Band IR-C are absorbed mostly in the epidermal layers andincrease skin temperature significantly (Schieke et al., 2003).The few studies conducted on IR collectively have concludedthat IR radiation produces heat upon exposure. Consideringthe general principle that all biochemical processes areaffected by temperature, the effects of IR on human skin canno longer be ignored.Effects of IR on the expression of collagen and MMPs in humanskinin vivoAlterations and deficiencies of collagen, the major structuralcomponent of the skin, have been suggested to be a cause ofthe skin wrinkling observed in both photoaged and naturallyaged skin (Fisher et al., 1997; Varani et al., 2000). Becausecollagen fibrils are responsible for the strength and resilience
of skin, their disarrangement during photoaging causes theskin to appear aged. Excessive matrix degradation by UV-induced matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) secreted byvarious cells, including keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and in-flammatory cells, contributes substantially to the connectivetissue damage that occurs during photoaging (Fisher et al.,
1996; Chung et al., 2001, 2002). Although human skin isfrequently exposed to IR radiation, little is known about the&2009 The Society for Investigative Dermatology www.jidonline.org 15REVIEWReceived 14 November 2008; accepted 8 January 20091Department of Dermatology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea;2Laboratory of Cutaneous Aging Research, Clinical ResearchInstitute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea and3Institute of Dermatological Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, KoreaCorrespondence: Dr Jin Ho Chung, Department of Dermatology, Seoul National University Hospital, 28 Yongon-dong, Chongno-Gu, Seoul 110-744, Korea .E-mail: jhchung@snu.ac.krAbbreviations: IR, infrared; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TRPV, transient receptor potential vanilloid
biological effects of IR on collagen metabolism. We reportedthe effects of acute and chronic IR exposure on type Iprocollagen expression (Kim et al., 2006b). To investigate theeffects of IR irradiation, we exposed human buttock skin tonear-IR radiation. Previously, we had proposed the minimalheating dose as a standard unit to measure IR energy incidenton human skin (Lee et al ., 2006). When we irradiatedvolunteers’ skin with IR, skin temperature rose to a certainpoint and then plateaued. We defined this radiationdose where the skin temperature plateaued as the minimalheating dose. Three minimal heating doses were irradiatedon human buttock skin once or three times a week for 4weeks. It was found that although single IR irradiationincreased type I procollagen expression, multiple irradiationsreduced its expression (Kim et al ., 2006b). Single IRirradiation increased the expression of TGF- b1, -b2, and-b3 in human skin in vivo , whereas repeated IR irradiation
reduced the expression of these TGF- bs. It is well known thatTGF- bpotently stimulates the proliferation of fibroblasts inthe dermis and induces the synthesis and secretion ofprocollagen (Massague, 1998). Therefore, alterations inTGF- bmay have influenced type I procollagen expressionin IR-exposed human skin.It was reported that a single treatment of humandermal fibroblasts with IR-A-induced MMP-1 (Schiekeet al., 2002). However, we demonstrated that MMP-1 wasnot induced by single IR irradiation in human skin in vivo(Kim et al., 2006b). In contrast to the effects of a single IRirradiation, multiple IR irradiations significantly increasedMMP-1 expression. Therefore, repeated IR exposure mightinduce premature skin aging (photoaging) in human skinin vivo .To determine whether IR can induce wrinkles in vivo ,mice were irradiated with IR five times a week for 15weeks (30 J day/C01) (Kim et al ., 2005). We observed thatIR can cause skin wrinkling and augment UV-induced
wrinkle formation through induction of MMPs (Kim et al.,2005).IR exposure turns on an angiogenic switch in human skin in vivoPhotoaging is the process whereby skin is prematurely agedby repeated exposure to solar UV radiation, and skinangiogenesis plays a critical role in this process (Yanoet al., 2002). Acute UV exposure of human skin is knownto induce angiogenesis, that is, to form new blood vessels, inhuman skin. These new vessels are immature and leaky,resulting in cutaneous inflammation by extravasation ofinflammatory cells and by the inflammatory mediators
produced by these cells. These events may contribute tofurther degradation of extracellular matrix proteins, providingan adverse, less permissive environment for the maintenanceof normal vessel structure and function, leading to progres-sive loss of cutaneous vessels in photoaged skin (Chung andEun, 2007). As is the case with UVB, exposure of human skinto near-IR induces dermal angiogenesis and alters thebalance between epidermal angiogenic factor (that is, VEGF)and endogenous angiogenic inhibitor (that is, TSP-2) (Kimet al., 2006a).Acute exposure of human skin to IR radiation increases mastcell number and tryptase expression in human skin in vivoMast cells are present in tissues throughout the body but aremost prevalent at sites that are exposed to the environment,such as skin, airways, and gastrointestinal tract (Metcalfeet al., 1997). Two types of mature human mast cells havebeen described, based on differences in their neutral proteasecomposition (Irani et al., 1986). MC
Tcells contain tryptasealone, whereas MC TCcells contain tryptase, chymase, andcathepsin G. UV radiation is considered an extrinsic factorthat can alter the prevalence of mast cells (Grimbaldestonet al ., 2003). Several studies have demonstrated that sun-exposed human skin has more mast cells than sun-protectedskin (Bhawan et al., 1992; Bosset et al., 2003). Recently, we
et al ., 2003). Several studies have demonstrated that sun-exposed human skin has more mast cells than sun-protectedskin (Bhawan et al., 1992; Bosset et al., 2003). Recently, wealso found that the number of mast cells in sun-exposed facialskin is always significantly higher than that in sun-protectedbuttock skin within the same individual (Kim et al., 2009). Onthe other hand, the effect of IR on dermal mast cellprevalence remains unclear at present. We demonstratedthat human skin mast cells are activated and recruited by IRas well as by UV. After IR irradiation of the buttock skin ofyoung subjects, the number of MCTCwas significantlyincreased at 24 h post-IR, while the number of MC Twas notaffected significantly. Tryptase expression was also clearlyupregulated by IR treatment in human skin in vivo (Kim et al.,2009).EFFECTS OF HEAT ON AGING PROCESSES IN HUMANSKIN IN VIVOEffects of heat on the expression of MMP-12 in human skinin vivo
in vivoWe demonstrated that heat shock induced the expression ofMMP-1 and MMP-3, but not MMP-2, at the mRNA andprotein levels in a dose-dependent manner in culturednormal human skin fibroblasts through activation of ERKand JNK and an autocrine IL-6 loop (Park et al., 2004). Thisincreased expression of MMPs by heat leads to degradation ofextracellular matrix proteins such as collagen and elasticfibers. Heat is also known to induce MMP-12, which iscapable of destroying the pre-existing elastic fiber network,thereby contributing to the accumulation of elastotic materialin photoaged skin (Chen et al., 2005). Therefore, heat, likeUV, is a major environmental stimulus that probably plays animportant role in the development of solar elastosis andpremature skin aging.Effects of heat on the expressions of tropoelastin and fibrillin-1in human skin in vivoIt has been reported that chronic IR exposure can cause
pronounced elastosis in mouse skin, changes that mimic thedamage caused by UV (Kligman, 1982). It is known thatrepeated and prolonged exposure to heat insufficient toproduce a burn causes erythema ab igne, which ischaracterized histologically by the basophilic degenerationof connective tissue and the alteration of elastic fibers, whichresembles elastotic changes in photoaged skin (Hurwitz andTisserand, 1987).16 Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings (2009), Volume 14S Cho et al.IR and Heat Cause Skin Aging
Heat was found to increase tropoelastin mRNA andprotein expression in the epidermis and in the dermis (Chenet al., 2005). Fibrillin-1 mRNA and protein expression wereincreased by heat in the epidermis but were diminished in thedermis (Chen et al., 2005). Therefore, the abnormal produc-tion of tropoelastin and fibrillin by heat, like UV, in humanskin and their degradation by various MMPs, such as MMP-12, may add to the accumulation of elastotic material inphotoaged skin (Chen et al., 2005).Heat induces angiogenesis in human skin in vivoIR radiation accounts for approximately 40% of the solarradiation energy reaching the earth’s surface, subsequentlygenerating heat and increasing skin temperature. Wedemonstrated that heat increases angiogenesis in human skinin vivo . The ratio of VEGF to TSP-1 and 2 is increased afterheat treatment, leading to increased angiogenesis (Kim et al.,2006a). Therefore, heat, in addition to UV, is an importantphysical stimulus for angiogenesis.
Effects of heat on cytokine expression in human skinHeat can induce various cytokines in human skin. Toinvestigate the effects of heat treatment on TGF- bexpression,human buttock skin was heated for 90 minutes at 43 1C. Theexpression of TGF- b1 and - b2 were increased at 24 hours,whereas that of TGF- b3 was decreased 24 hours after heattreatment (Seo and Chung, 2006). Heat treatment alsoincreased the expression of IL-6 and IL-12 mRNA signifi-cantly in cultured dermal fibroblasts (Seo and Chung, 2006).Heat induces various cytokines, and these cytokines in turnregulate the extracellular matrix protein metabolism inhuman skin.Effects of heat on ROS productionThe transcriptional upregulation of MMPs can be mediatedby the increased production of reactive oxygen species(ROS). UV irradiation induces the formation of ROS incutaneous tissue (Kitazawa et al., 1997; Scharffetter-Kocha-neket al., 1997). ROS can be generated by many different
organelles in response to various stimuli. Various enzymesystems including cyclooxygenase, nitric oxide synthase(NOS), xanthine oxidase, ribonucleotide reductase, mito-chondrial electron transport systems, and NADPH oxidaseare involved in ROS production (Curtin et al., 2002). Like UV,heat shock generates H2O2and O 2K/C0(Hall et al ., 1994;Zhang et al., 2003). Heat shock-driven generation of ROSsubstantially affects the signaling pathways leading to MMP-1and MMP-9 induction. Heat shock generates H 2O2and O 2K/C0through NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and the mito-chondrial electron transport system in HaCaT cells (Shinet al ., 2008). Heat shock-induced O2K/C0is responsible forMMP-9 expression, whereas H 2O2is involved in theinduction of both MMP-1 and -9 (Shin et al., 2008).It has been demonstrated that topical application ofantioxidants, genistein or N-acetylcystein, can interrupt theUV-signaling cascade that leads to photoaging (Kang et al.,
2003). These investigators demonstrated that UV increasesH2O2in human skin in vivo and that both antioxidantsblocked UV-induced signaling. As heat is known to causeROS generation, we investigated the role of ROS in heat-induced tropoelastin and fibrillin-1 expression (Chen et al.,2005). We found that pretreatment with N-acetylcystein orgenistein for 24 h prior to heat treatment inhibited the heat-induced expression of tropoelastin in the epidermis, but notof fibrillin-1 (Chen et al., 2005). These results indicate thatheat-induced ROS may play a critical role in heat-inducedtropoelastin expression, but not in heat-induced fibrillin-1expression.Heat induces oxidative DNA damage in human skin in vivoUV radiation is absorbed directly by DNA and leads to theformation of pyrimidine dimers, of which more than 75% are
thymine dimers (Patrick, 1977). UV radiation produces ROS.DNA is also susceptible to oxidative damage, and 8-oxo-dGis a useful biomarker of oxidative damage in DNA (Pelleet al., 2003). As heat shock in human skin can produce ROS,
we investigated the effects of heat shock on DNA damage inhuman skin in vivo . Interestingly, heat shock at 43 1C for90 minutes, like UV irradiation, increased the 8-oxo-dG inthe epidermis and dermis of human skin in vivo maximally at24 hours post-heat (Figure 1a). However, heat shock, unlikeUV, did not produce thymidine dimer formation (Figure 1b).Therefore, heat-induced ROS induce cumulative DNAdamage through oxidative damage.The effects of IR and heat in the natural sunlight on human skinIn addition to UV radiation, IR plus visible light and the heatenergy generated by sunlight exposure induce MMP-1expression after exposing human skin to natural sunlight(Cho et al., 2008). IR plus visible light also increase MMP-9expression and decrease type I procollagen synthesis afterexposure to natural sunlight (Cho et al ., 2008). Only UVradiation within natural sunlight results in neutrophil infiltra-tion in human skin at least at 24 hours after exposure,
whereas IR radiation and heat, in addition to UV, can recruitmacrophages.TRPV1 in the keratinocytes as a heat sensorTransient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) ion channels area large family of nonselective cation channels that areexpressed in human keratinocytes, and they are knownto be activated by capsaicin, noxious heat, and low pH(Szallasi and Blumberg, 1999). TRPV1 itself is known tobe a heat sensor. TRPV1 can be activated by noxious heatwith a threshold of about 43 1C (Hayes et al., 2000). However,the function of TRPV1 in cutaneous physiology andpathology has not been elucidated. Recently, we foundthat activation of TRPV1 by heat shock mediates the heatshock-induced MMP-1 expression in HaCaT cells (Li et al.,2007; Lee et al ., 2008). TRPV1 plays an important rolein heat shock-induced MMP-1 expression, and a calcium-dependent PKC asignaling is required for heat shock-inducedMMP-1 expression in human keratinocytes (Li et al., 2007;
Leeet al., 2008). Therefore, the TRPV-1 inhibitory compoundwould be a good candidate to prevent heat-induced skinaging.www.jidonline.org 17S Cho et al.IR and Heat Cause Skin Aging
CONCLUSIONRecent evidence indicates that IR and heat may inducepremature skin aging, just like UV radiation: (1) IR exposureof human skin stimulates the expression of MMP-1 anddecreases type I procollagen expression in vivo . Acute IRirradiation also increases new, leaky vessel formation andinduces inflammatory cellular infiltration. (2) Heat energy,which increases skin temperature, also increases MMP-1, -3,and -12, and modulates elastin and fibrillin synthesis,resulting in the development of solar elastosis. Acute heat
shock in human skin stimulates new vessel formation, recruitsinflammatory cells, and causes oxidative DNA damage.Based on these observations, it can be concluded that IRand heat are important physical stimuli that may cause agingin human skin. Therefore, in addition to sunscreen to blockthe effects of UV, novel strategies to block IR- and heat-induced skin aging need to be developed to prevent skinaging more completely. TRPV-1 may be a good target forpreventing heat-induced skin aging (thermal skin aging) inhuman skin in vivo .CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors state no conflict of interest.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis research was supported by a Grant (R11-2002-097-06001-0) through theCenter for Aging and Apoptosis Research at Seoul National University fromthe Korean Science & Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).REFERENCESBhawan J, Oh CH, Lew R, Nehal KS, Labadie RR, Tsay A et al.
