Research Article1a,25(OH) 2-Vitamin D and a Nongenomic Vitamin DAnalogue Inhibit Ultraviolet Radiation –Induced SkinCarcinogenesisKatie M. Dixon1, Anthony W. Norman4, Vanessa B. Sequeira1, Ritu Mohan1, Mark S. Rybchyn1,Vivienne E. Reeve3, Gary M. Halliday2, and Rebecca S. Mason1AbstractExposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can lead to a range of deleterious responses in the skin. Animportant form of damage is the DNA photolesion cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD). CPDs can behighly mutagenic if not repaired prior to cell division and can lead to UV-induced immunosuppression,making them potentially carcinogenic. UVR exposure also produces vitamin D, a prehormone. Differentshapes of the steroid hormone 1 a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3[1,25(OH) 2D3] can produce biologicalresponses through binding either to its cognate nuclear receptor (VDR) to regulate gene transcriptionor to the VDR associated with plasma membrane caveolae to produce, via signal transduction, nongenomic
physiologic responses. Here, we show that both 1,25(OH) 2D3and 1 a,25(OH) 2-lumisterol (JN), aconformationally restricted analogue that can generate only nongenomic responses, are effective inhibitorsof UV damage in an immunocompetent mouse (Skh:hr1) model susceptible to UV-induced tumors. Both1,25(OH) 2D3and JN significantly reduced UVR-induced CPD, apoptotic sunburn cells, and immuno-suppression. Furthermore, these compounds inhibited skin tumor development, both papillomas andsquamous cell carcinomas, in these mice. The observed reduction of these UV-induced effects by 1,25(OH) 2D3and JN suggests a role for these compounds in prevention against skin carcinogenesis. To the bestof our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report of an in vivo long-term biological responsegenerated by chronic dosing with a nongenomic-selective vitamin D steroid. Cancer Prev Res; 4(9);1485–94. /C2112011 AACR.IntroductionUltraviolet radiation (UVR) causes many biological
responses in the skin, including sunburn inflammation(erythema), apoptosis, photo immunosuppression, andmutagenic DNA damage. One of the most commonDNA photolesions is the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer(CPD), formed generally when 2 adjacent pyrimidinesundergo an opening of the 5-6 double bond and form astable ring structure following absorption of photons fromUVR wavelengths in the UVB range, though other mechan-isms may also contribute to CPD formation (1, 2). OtherDNA photolesions can be formed, including the 6-4 photo-product (6-4PP), but these lesions are repaired more effi-ciently and are less prevalent than CPDs (3). CPDs arehighly mutagenic, and if they are not repaired before cellreplication they may ultimately lead to skin carcinogenesis(4). Repair of CPDs also prevents immunosuppression, asCPD formation is a direct molecular trigger of immuno-suppression (5). Despite these detrimental effects of UVR, it
is required to produce vitamin D 3in skin cells. Vitamin D 3is produced in the skin following exposure of its precursor,7-dehydrocholesterol, to UVR (6). Following 2 successivehydroxylation reactions, the biologically active steroidhormone 1 a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3[1,25(OH) 2D3]i sformed.Steroid hormones can serve as chemical messengers in awide number of species and target tissues to transmit signalsthat result in both genomic and nongenomic responses (7).Although it is clear that steroid hormone regulation of genetranscription is mediated by formation of a ligand–receptorcomplex with a cognate receptor of the superfamily ofsteroid hormone nuclear receptors (8), substantial evidenceindicates that the nongenomic responses are mediated by avariety of receptor types located near or associated with theplasma membrane (7).

membrane caveolae of target cells where it is engaged inmediating nongenomic responses (9, 10). The VDRligand 1,25(OH) 2D3is highly conformationally flexible,and it has been shown that one shape of 1,25(OH) 2D3ispreferred for genomic responses whereas another shapeis preferred by the VDR for nongenomic responses (11–13). The 6-s- cisconformationally restricted analogue1a,25(OH) 2-lumisterol (JN) shows little ability toincrease transcription of the osteocalcin gene in bonecells compared with 1,25(OH) 2D3(14) but generatesnongenomic actions in pancreatic bcells and endothelialcells (15, 16).Our previous studies, and those of others, provide com-pelling evidence for novel photoprotective effects of vita-min D compounds in human skin cells and in hairless mice(17–24). These studies were limited to investigation of theeffects of an application of these compounds in acute UVR-induced skin damage, including cell loss and formation of
DNA lesions in the form of CPDs and preliminary studieson photo immunosuppression. We previously proposedthat 2 mechanisms might contribute to protection fromUVR-induced DNA damage: a further enhancement by1,25(OH) 2D3of nuclear p53 expression after UVR expo-sure and a decrease in nitric oxide (NO) products (17). Theincrease in p53 could facilitate DNA repair (25). Becauseincreased NO inhibits DNA repair (26, 27), the 1,25(OH) 2D3-induced decrease in NO products may also con-tribute to better DNA repair. Photocarcinogenesis, how-ever, is the result of chronic UVR exposure. Consequently,although the data provide evidence for photoprotection byvitamin D compounds in terms of acute damage, they donot necessarily imply that the compounds inhibit skincarcinogenesis.The photocarcinogenesis protocol in albino hairless micedelivers an established carcinogenic dose resulting in initia-tion of benign mouse skin lesions and subsequently pro-
gression to squamous cell carcinomas (SCC; refs. 28–31).Mouse skin in the initiation stage shows persistent generalhyperplasia and the formation of multiple discrete benignpapillomas (32). The onset of such benign papillomas inmice is analogous to the appearance of actinic keratosis(AK) in human skin. AKs are thought to be the key event inthe evolution from photo-aged skin to SCC (33). Similar toskin papilloma formation in mice, the causative factor ofAKs is believed to be chronic/long-term UVR exposure.Previous studies have supported a protective role for 1,25(OH) 2D3and some related analogues in response to che-mical-induced carcinogenesis, also initiated through papil-loma formation (34, 35).Although nongenomic responses to 1,25(OH) 2D3andother steroid hormones in various cell types have beendescribed by many groups, their overall significance inphysiologic responses is unclear and to date no long-termnongenomic response in vivo has been definitively linked to
1,25(OH) 2D3. Our preliminary studies in human skin cellsin culture were consistent with the proposal that thephotoprotective effects of 1,25(OH) 2D3occur via a non-genomic signal transduction–mediated pathway. Thisreport describes the use of the conformationally flexiblesteroid hormone form of vitamin D 31,25(OH) 2D3and aconformationally restricted structural analogue JN to inhi-bit UVR-induced skin carcinogenesis.Materials and MethodsCell culture and treatmentsStudies in human skin cells were approved by theUniversity of Sydney Human Ethics Committee (refer-ence 1866). Keratinocytes were cultured from neonatalforeskins as previously described (36), and cells of pas-sages 2 to 5 were seeded onto poly- L-lysine–coated glasscoverslips in 96-well plates for p53 studies or directly into96-well plates for nitrotyrosine studies. The active meta-bolite 1,25(OH) 2D3was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,whereas both JN and 1 b,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3(HL)

bolite 1,25(OH) 2D3was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,whereas both JN and 1 b,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3(HL)were synthesized in the laboratory of Prof. A.W. Norman(University of California, Riverside, CA). 25-Dehydro-1 a-hydroxyvitamin D 3-26,23S-lactone (TEI-9647) was a giftfrom Dr. Seiichi Ishizuka (Teijin Institute for BiomedicalResearch, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were treated with vehicle,1,25(OH) 2D3, or JN immediately after UVR exposure. Forthe study with HL and TEI-9647, these compounds wereadded for 24 hours prior to irradiation alone or incombination with 1,25(OH) 2D3and again immediatelyafter UVR exposure. The UVR source for in vitro studiesconsisted of a UVA and a UVB fluorescent tube (Phillips),providing irradiance of 1,168 mJ/cm2UVA and 203 mJ/cm2UVB, filtered through 0.5-mm cellulose triacetate(Eastman Chemical Products) to remove wavelengthsbelow 290 nm.Detection of p53, CPD, and 3-nitrotyrosineFor detection of p53 and CPD, cells were fixed with
methanol (100%) at 4/C14C for 10 minutes at 3 and 6 hourspost–UVR exposure. Immunocytochemistry, using theD07 mouse monoclonal IgG2B anti-p53 antibody (Dako-cytomation) or the mouse monoclonal IgG1 lanti-thy-mine dimer antibody (Affitech; ref. 37), with imageanalysis was carried out as previously described (17).For whole-cell ELISA detection of 3-nitrotyrosine, perox-ynitrite (420 mmol/L) was added to positive control wells1 hour before fixation with formaldehyde [3.7% (v/v) inPBS] at room temperature for 10 minutes. Briefly, cellswere washed 3 /C2with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100,followed by blocking with H 2O2(1% in PBS) and thenFBS (5% in PBS). 3-Nitrotyro sine was detected by incuba-tion with the mouse monoclonal IgG2b primary antibody(Abcam) overnight at 4/C14Ca tac o n c e n t r a t i o no f2 mg/mL,followed by goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Cell SignalingTechnology) for 1 hour at room temperature. Colordevelopment was initiated with a citrate phosphate buffer
containing tetramethylbenzidine (0.1 mg/mL) and H 2O2.Following development (30–40 minutes), the reactionwas stopped by the addition of H 2SO4(2 mol/L). Absor-bance was read at 450 nm on a Polarstar Galaxy micro-plate reader (BMG Labtech).Dixon et al.Cancer Prev Res; 4(9) September 2011 Cancer Prevention Research 1486Downloaded from http://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article-pdf/4/9/1485/2250353/1485.pdf by guest on 10 November 2024
Murine studiesFemale Skh:hr1 hairless mice were maintained in wire-topped plastic boxes at 23/C14Ct o2 5/C14C on compressed paperbedding from Fibrecycle Pty. Ltd. The project was approvedby the Animal Ethics Committee of the University ofSydney (K22/3-2005/4/4089). Mice were fed Gordon ratand mouse pellets and tap water ad libitum . The solar-simulated UVR source was 1 fluorescent UVB tube (PhilipsTL40W 12R/S) flanked by 6 UVA tubes (Hitachi 40W F40T10/BL) and was filtered through 0.125-mm cellulose acet-ate sheeting (Grafix Plastics) as described in our previousstudies (23). Animals were divided into treatment groupsof 5 for immunosuppression studies and groups of 3 forstudies involving histologic analyses. UV-irradiated micewere subjected to a single exposure equal to 3 times theminimal erythemal dose (MED) of UVR (3.98 kJ/m2UVBand 63.8 kJ/m2UVA) for histologic and immunosuppres-sion studies.Immediately after irradiation, mice were treated topi-
cally on the dorsal surface with vehicle, 1,25(OH) 2D3,o rJN. Stock solutions of test compounds were dissolved inethanol and diluted in a base lotion containing ethanol,propylene glycol, and water to a final solvent ratio of2:1:1, respectively. Treatments were applied topically onthe highest part of the back as 100 mL of vehicle (baselotion) only, or vehicle containing 1,25(OH) 2D3(22.8or 4.6 rmol/cm2), or JN (22.8 rmol/cm2), as indicated inresults.HistologyBiopsies were taken from UV-irradiated dorsal skin 3 or24 hours post–UVR exposure and fixed in Histochoicefixative (Amresco) for 6 hours. Skin samples were paraf-fin-embedded and 5- mm sections were cut for all analyses.Sections (24 hours after UVR exposure) were subjected toroutine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining for visua-lization of sunburn cells (SBC). The stained sections wereexamined under a Zeiss-Axioplan light microscope at 40 /C2magnification, and the number of sunburn cells per linear
millimeter of skin section was recorded. Immunohisto-chemistry and image analysis were carried out for CPDdetection (3 hours after UVR exposure) as described pre-viously (17). The antibody was specific for thymine dimers,the major subset of CPDs (38). Analysis of p53 expressionin human keratinocytes was carried out as previouslydescribed (17).Contact hypersensitivityThe contact hypersensitivity response was tested to inves-tigate the effects of 1,25(OH) 2D3and JN on UVR-inducedsystemic immunosuppression. Mice were sensitizedapproximately 1 week after irradiation with 100 mLo f2% oxazolone [Sigma; (w/v)] in absolute alcohol, appliedto the nonirradiated abdominal skin. Sensitization wasrepeated on the subsequent day. The sensitized mice werechallenged 2 weeks after irradiation by application of 5 mL2% oxazolone to each surface of both pinnae so that eachmouse received 20 mL in total. Ear thickness measurementswere recorded before challenge and at 16 hours after
challenge.Photocarcinogenesis modelFor photocarcinogenesis studies, groups of 20 micewere exposed to a suberythemal dose of UVR on 5 d/wk for 10 weeks. The solar-simulated UVR source wasidentical to that used in our previous studies (23), asdescribed earlier for acute exposures, but the daily dosewas lowered to mimic chronic human sunlight exposurewithout burning. The daily dose provided 0.658 kJ/m2UVB and 20.30 kJ/m2UVA, which is approximately oneMED. Erythema in the hairless mouse is difficult toobserve, and the term MED s trictly refers to minimaledematous dose because it is the edema by which theinflammatory reaction can be quantified. A fan, situatedequidistant from each box of mice during irradiation, wasused to control temperature.Immediately after irradiation, mice were treated topi-cally over 7 cm2on the irradiated dorsal skin with 100 mLof either base lotion, 1,25(OH) 2D3(22.8 or 4.6 rmol/cm2), or JN (22.8 rmol/cm2). Mice receiving 1,25
cm2), or JN (22.8 rmol/cm2). Mice receiving 1,25(OH) 2D3(22.8 rmol/cm2) showed slight but nonstatis-
of either base lotion, 1,25(OH) 2D3(22.8 or 4.6 rmol/cm2), or JN (22.8 rmol/cm2). Mice receiving 1,25(OH) 2D3(22.8 rmol/cm2) showed slight but nonstatis-tically significant weight reductions compared with micein other treatment groups at 2 weeks. As this was likely tobe due to dehydration caused by hypercalcemia/hyper-calcuria, the dose was lowered to 11.4 rmol/cm2at thecommencement of week 3 for the remainder of theirradiation/treatment period. Hypercalcemia results inincreased urinary calcium, which then causes a diuresisand subsequent weight loss. Calcium levels were notdirectly measured because of the practical difficulty ofobtaining blood without morbidity or mortality, but micewere monitored for weight loss, as it is a sensitive sign ofhypercalcuria. Weight lo ss was not observed in micetreated with JN. After the dose of 1,25(OH) 2D3waslowered, no further weight loss occurred—average mouseweight did not differ significantly from that of other
groups. The highest dose of 1,25(OH) 2D3is given as11.4 rmol/cm2in the text, figures, and legends, as thisdose was used for most of the study.The time of appearance and the location of tumors weremapped for each mouse over the first 10 weeks of UVR/treatment and the following 30 weeks of tumor monitor-ing. Skin tumor formation, as evidenced by an outgrowth1-mm or greater in diameter, was expressed as both theaverage tumor incidence (% of mice affected) and theaverage tumor multiplicity (average number of tumorsper tumor-bearing mouse) for each treatment group. Alltumors were biopsied and examined histologically to con-firm the diagnosis. The minimum criterion for diagnosis ofa SCC was local invasion into the dermis.Statistical analysesThe Mantel–Haenszel log-rank test (39) was used toanalyze incidence data—as the progressive probability ofacquiring a tumor, comparing all treatments with control
over the entire time course of the study.Vitamin D Compounds Inhibit Photocarcinogenesiswww.aacrjournals.org Cancer Prev Res; 4(9) September 2011 1487Downloaded from http://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article-pdf/4/9/1485/2250353/1485.pdf by guest on 10 November 2024
In CPD, SBC, and immunosuppression studies,results are based on 3 to 5 mice per group. Experimentswere carried out at least twice with similar results.R e s u l t sa r ee x p r e s s e da sm e a n /C61S Do r /C61S E Mfrom multiple experiments as indicated. Comparisonsbetween treatment groups were made by ANOVA, fol-lowed by Dunnett’s or Tukey–Kramer post-test, usingthe GraphPad Instat statistical program (GraphPad Soft-ware Inc.).ResultsUVR-induced CPDs in mouse skin measured 3 hoursafter UVR exposure (Fig. 1A and B) were reduced to asimilar extent as a result of topical treatment with either1,25(OH) 2D3or JN applied immediately after UVRexposure. Sunburn cells (apoptotic keratinocytes)assessed at 24 hours were also reduced to a similarextent in mice by both 1,25(OH) 2D3and JN (Fig. 1C).Along with this, skin edema after UV, measured after 48hours, was also reduced by 1,25(OH) 2D3and bothdoses of JN (Fig. 1D). We have previously shown in
preliminary studies that UVR-induced immunosuppres-sion is reduced by 1,25(OH) 2D3and a high dose of JN.As shown in Figure 1E, topical JN also reduced UVR-induced immunosuppression dose dependently, identi-c a lt ot h er e s u l t so b t a i n e dw ith equivalent 1,25(OH) 2D3concentrations (23). In cultured keratinocytes, JN and1,25(OH) 2D3f u r t h e ri n c r e a s e dn u c l e a rp 5 3a f t e rU V Rexposure (Fig. 2A) beyond the effect of UVR alone. JNalso reduced UVR-induced NO products, as measuredby 3-nitrotyrosine, after UVR exposure to a similarextent as equimolar 1,25(OH) 2D3( F i g .2 B ) .L e v e l so f3-nitrotyrosine in sham-irradiated keratinocytes treatedwith 1,25(OH) 2D3were not significantly different thanthose in sham-irradiated vehicle-treated cells. In normalskin keratinocytes, the protective effect of 1,25(OH) 2D3on CPD after UVR exposure was abolished in thepresence of the nongenomic antagonist HL but unaf-
fected by the presence of the genomic antagonist TEI-9647 (Fig. 2C). Using the Tukey–Kramer post-test,which allows for comparisons between all groups ratherthan comparison with only vehicle control, there wasno significant difference in CPD in cells treated with1,25(OH) 2D3or with 1,25(OH) 2D3and TEI-9647. Incontrast, the number of CP D-positive nuclei in cellstreated with 1,25(OH) 2D3and TEI-9647 was signifi-cantly lower than that in ce lls treated with TEI-9647alone ( P<0.01).Mice began to develop papillomas toward the end of the10-week period of UVR and treatment. Figure 3A showstypical histology of the tumors recorded during the study,and Figure 3B shows photographs of some of the skintumors formed. The photographs in Figure 3B (i) and (ii)show papillomas and Figure 3B (iii) and (iv) show bothSCCs and papillomas.The period to onset of tumor (papilloma) formation
in mice varied between treatment groups. The averagelatency in the vehicle-treated group was 22.5 /C62.9 weeksfrom the first UVR exposure and topical treatment.This increased significant ly compared with vehiclein 1,25(OH) 2D3-treated mice (11.4 rmol/cm2) to 28.3/C68.3 weeks ( P<0.05), but it was not different than thatfor vehicle with any other treatment (data not shown).Tumor incidence was calculated as the percentage ofmice in each group bearing 1 or more tumors, recordedon a weekly basis throughout the 40-week study. All treat-ments were compared with vehicle control over the entiretime course of the study, using the Mantel–Haenszel log-rank test. Treatment with 1,25(OH) 2D3(11.4 rmol/cm2)resulted in highly significantly lower tumor incidence(P¼5.7/C210/C011) and significantly lower tumor incidencewith 1,25(OH) 2D34.6rmol/cm2(P<0.01) than withvehicle treatment (Fig. 4A). There was also a significantlylower risk of developing a tumor in mice treated with the
low-calcemic nongenomic agonist JN (22.8 rmol/cm2;P<0.01; Fig. 4A). It can be seen in this figure that tumorincidence in all groups increased over time. Decreases in
low-calcemic nongenomic agonist JN (22.8 rmol/cm2;P<0.01; Fig. 4A). It can be seen in this figure that tumorincidence in all groups increased over time. Decreases intumor incidence at some time points occurred because oftumor regressions.In the vehicle group, there were a total of 22 tumorregressions; 23% of tumors completely regressed. Thepercentage of tumor regressions was not significantlyhigher in the 1,25(OH) 2D311.4 rmol/cm2group(26%, a total of 8 regressions) or any of the other treat-ment groups.Tumor multiplicity was calculated as the average numberof tumors per tumor-bearing mouse. Figure 4B shows theaverage tumor multiplicity throughout the 40-week courseof study. Significant reductions were observed with 1,25(OH) 2D3(11.4 rmol/cm2) and JN (22.8 rmol/cm2). Aver-age tumor multiplicity was significantly reduced from 1.3/C60.3 in vehicle-treated mice to 0.3 /C60.2 ( P<0.05) in micetreated with 1,25(OH) 2D3(11.4 rmol/cm2) at 23 weeks
following the first UVR exposure and remained signifi-cantly reduced for the entire study thereafter. At week27, a further reduction in multiplicity was noted in the1,25(OH) 2D3-treated group, from 2.5 /C60.4 in the vehiclegroup to 0.8 /C60.2 ( P<0.01). JN was also effective inreducing tumor multiplicity from 26 weeks onward. Aver-age tumor multiplicity was reduced from 2.0 /C60.4 invehicle-treated mice to 0.9 /C60.2 ( P<0.05) in JN-treatedmice.Some of the papillomas progressed to SCCs through-out the course of the study. Figure 4C shows incidence ofSCC over the period of study. When analyzed by theMantel–Haenszel log-rank test, which tests the progres-sive probability of acquiring a tumor over the entire timecourse of the study (based on weekly data), the progres-sive risk of developing a tumor over the entire timecourse was reduced by 1,25(OH) 2D3and JN. Treatmentwith both doses of 1,25(OH) 2D3(11.4 and 4.6 rmol/cm2) resulted in significantly lower incidence of SCC
over the period of the study, compared with vehicle,as did treatment with JN (22.8 rmol/cm2;F i g .4 C ) .Figure 4D shows incidence of SCC at 40 weeks.

DiscussionThe data presented in this study support our previousfindings on protection by 1,25(OH) 2D3against acute UVR-induced events associated with initiation of carcinogenesis,such as DNA damage, and extend these findings to showprotection against chronic UVR-induced skin carcinogen-esis. We have previously proposed that photoprotection by1,25(OH) 2D3is likely to be mediated through the non-genomic pathway (20, 22, 23), in part because of the acuteeffects of JN and because the photoprotective actions of1,25(OH) 2D3in fibroblasts were completely reversed by anongenomic antagonist but not by an antagonist of thegenomic pathway (23). In the current study, we show thereversal of the protective effect of 1,25(OH) 2D3in normalskin keratinocytes by the nongenomic antagonist HL butnot by the genomic pathway antagonist 25-dehydro-1 a-hydroxyvitamin D 3-26,23S-lactone (TEI-9647; P¼non-significant, comparison of 1,25(OH) 2D3vs. 1,25(OH) 2D3

Furthermore, weshow that JN, a 6-s- cis-locked analogue that is only capableof acting via the nongenomic pathway (14–16), mimickedat least to some extent the photoprotective effects of 1,25(OH) 2D3in a murine in vivo model.Two doses of 1,25(OH) 2D3were tested in the photo-carcinogenesis model, based on its effects in earlier acutestudies. The original concentration for the higher dose of1,25(OH) 2D3was 22.8 rmol/cm2.

treatment groups. As this was likely to be due to dehydra-tion caused by hypercalcemia/hypercalcuria, the dose waslowered to 11.4 rmol/cm2at the commencement of week 3for the remainder of the irradiation/treatment period. Nofurther weight loss occurred, and the new dose of 11.4rmol/cm2was still effective in reducing skin carcinogen-esis. In our previous studies in which mice were treatedwith a dose of 22.8 rmol/cm2, the treatment was adminis-tered only once immediately after UVR exposure and didnot cause any adverse effects (23).We previously showed JN to have a similar potency tothat of 1,25(OH) 2D3in reducing UVR-induced CPD andcell loss, 24 hours after irradiation, in cultured human skincells (20, 23). As shown in the current study, treatmentwith this analogue also reduced UVR-induced CPD 3 hourspost–UVR exposure and sunburn cells, skin edema, andimmunosuppression in mice with a potency similar to thatof 1,25(OH) 2D3. Topical application of JN also resulted in
significant protection from photocarcinogenesis, thoughnot to the same level as that conferred by even half the doseof 1,25(OH) 2D3. The finding that 1,25(OH) 2D3, evenwhen used at lower doses, is more effective than JN maywell be due to its ability to act via 2 pathways, includinggenomic responses, whereas JN can activate only the non-genomic pathway. For example, induction of the oxygenradical scavenger metallothionein was observed in the skinof UVB-irradiated mice that had been treated topically with1,25(OH) 2D3(18). Moreover, 1,25(OH) 2D3has beenshown to regulate metallothionein gene expression (40)and this may contribute to photoprotection. Comprehen-sive studies on the effects of JN on other early molecularmarkers of skin carcinogenesis may prove useful in deter-mining why this compound was less effective than 1,25(OH) 2D3in reducing skin carcinogenesis. In this study, thelow-calcemic compound JN did not cause hypercalcemia.
Future studies in which higher doses of JN are tested mayperhaps show a stronger protective role for this compound.The results of this study showed that topical applicationof 1,25(OH) 2D3or JN immediately after daily UVR sig-nificantly reduced tumorigenesis. The ability of 1,25(OH) 2D3and JN to inhibit tumor formation in micemay be attributed, in part, to their ability to reduceCPD (17, 20, 22, 23). Although thymine (T <>T) dimersare not reportedly mutagenic (though this has beendisputed), T <>T dimers are proportional to other CPD(2). Supporting this view are separate studies by ourgroup showing fewer CPD post–UVR exposure with1,25(OH) 2D3,u s i n gam e t h o di nw h i c hD N Aw a sextracted from cultured skin cells and digested withT4N5 endonuclease followed by alkaline gel electrophor-esis (24), as described by Ananthaswamy and Fisher (41).It has been proposed that CPD formation is responsiblefor induction of the major mutational hotspots in UVR-
induced mouse skin tumors (42).The mechanism for reduced CPD with vitamin D com-pounds is not clear but may involve enhanced DNA repair.In an earlier publication, we showed further increases inp53 expression with 1,25(OH) 2D3treatment as seen afterAii iiii ivv1.5 mm6 mm3 mm7 mmSCCSCCpapillomapapillomaii iiii ivBFigure 3.

UVR alone. In the current study, JN also enhanced p53nuclear expression to a similar extent. p53 has been impli-cated in the facilitation of DNA repair (25). We alsoshowed that 1,25(OH) 2D3reduced NO products measuredby the insensitive Griess assay. Here, using a more sensitivemeasure of nitrative damage, 3-NT (43), we show a clearreduction in 3-NT with both 1,25(OH) 2D3and similarconcentrations of JN. These results complement those ofEllison and colleagues, who showed that VDR-knockoutmice are much more susceptible to photocarcinogenesis(44). The VDR has been shown to be essential for non-genomic effects of vitamin D compounds (9, 10, 13). InVDR-knockout mice, thymine dimer repair was signifi-cantly reduced (44). In those studies, there was no increasein chemical-induced carcinogenesis in 1 a-hydroxylase-knockdown mice, which are unable to produce 1,25(OH) 2D3. These authors concluded that the unligandedVDR, rather than vitamin D metabolites, was important for
protection from chemical-induced skin carcinogenesis, butUVR-induced carcinogenesis in 1 a-hydroxylase-knock-down mice was not examined. Our results and those ofWood and colleagues (34) and Kensler and colleagues (35)provide direct evidence that 1,25(OH) 2D3itself and relatedcompounds protect against skin carcinogenesis. An alter-native explanation for the results of the study conducted byEllison and colleagues (44) is that photoprotection in miceseems to be mediated through a nongenomic pathway,which is still likely to involve the VDR but which may beactivated by compounds other than the classical hormone(10).Although we added vitamin D compounds topically afterUV and showed photoprotection, it is likely that vitamin Dand metabolites produced physiologically in skin afterUVR exposure contribute to photoprotection also. Produc-tion of vitamin D 3in skin following UVR exposure takesseveral hours and subsequent conversion to 1,25(OH) 2D3
requires several more hours (45). This time course makes itmore likely that vitamin D compounds produced locally inskin, some of which may stay in skin (45), can provideprotection against subsequent exposures to UVR ratherthan the UVR exposure that resulted in their production.This is analogous to increased pigmentation and cornifica-tion that occur as a result of UVR damage and contribute tophotoadaptation (46). It is known that continued UVRresults in the degradation of vitamin D 3, leading to theproduction of overirradiated products (47, 48).

structures of some of these overirradiation products areconformationally restricted non secos-teroids, it is possibleto speculate that they too might act via nongenomicmechanisms to provide endogenous photoprotection, suchas analogue JN, as described here. One of these compoundsis, in fact, lumisterol-D 3, and pathways for the metabolismof lumisterol to JN have been reported (49, 50).The data presented in this study raise the possibility thatvitamin D analogues, including nongenomic analogues,may be useful in the prevention of UVR-induced skincarcinogenesis, though dose-ranging studies would benecessary. In particular, because vitamin D compoundsare effective immediately after UV exposure, they representthe possibility of a second chance at UV protection.Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of InterestNo potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.AcknowledgmentThe authors thank Dr W.H.
