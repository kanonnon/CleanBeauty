Molecular Basis of Tobacco Smoke-Induced PrematureSkin AgingAkimichi Morita1, Kan Torii1, Akira Maeda1and Yuji Yamaguchi1Although it is now widely recognized that tobaccosmoke has negative effects on the skin, the molecularmechanisms underlying its skin-aging effects remainuncertain. Epidemiological studies indicate that to-bacco smoking is a strong independent predictor offacial wrinkle formation and other aspects of pre-mature skin aging. Recentin vivo studies in humansand mice provided the first direct evidence thattobacco smoke causes premature skin aging, and theyhave begun to reveal the molecular changes in theskin that occur in response to it. Water-soluble
skin that occur in response to it. Water-solubletobacco smoke extract, which predominantly pro-duces oxidative stress when applied topically tocultured skin fibroblasts, impairs collagen biosynth-esis. Matrix metalloproteinases, which degrade col-lagen, are induced dose-dependently by tobaccosmoke extract as well as by other constituents thattrigger the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates thetoxicity of several environmental contaminants, in-cluding photoproducts in the body generated by UVBradiation. Tobacco smoke also contains many non-water-soluble constituents that activate the AhR path-way. Our most recent studies using hexane-solubletobacco extract indicate that activation of the AhRpathway may play a role in the premature skin-agingeffects of tobacco smoke exposure.Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings (2009) 14,53–55; doi:10.1038/jidsymp.2009.13INTRODUCTION
53–55; doi:10.1038/jidsymp.2009.13INTRODUCTIONTobacco smoking has specific damaging effects on the skin,which can result in poor wound healing, squamous cellcarcinoma, melanoma, oral cancer, acne, psoriasis, eczema,hair loss, and premature skin aging (Freiman et al ., 2004).Epidemiological studies implicate tobacco smoking as animportant factor in premature skin aging (Kadunce et al .,1991; Ernster et al ., 1995; Morita, 2007). Tobacco smokinginduces structural and compositional changes in theepidermis and dermis similar to those resulting from chronicUV radiation exposure, and it is an important environmentalfactor in premature skin aging (Grether-Beck et al ., 1997;Fisher et al., 1999). A smoker’s face is characterized by grayskin (smoker’s melanosis) and deep wrinkles (smoker’swrinkle). Here, we describe molecular mechanisms under-lying tobacco smoke-induced premature skin aging (Figure 1).IN VIVO EVIDENCE FOR THE SKIN-AGING EFFECTS OFTOBACCO SMOKE
TOBACCO SMOKEWrinkle formation is a typical clinical feature associated withtobacco smoking (Daniell, 1971). In a cross-sectional studyinvestigating the association bet ween facial wrinkle formationand tobacco smoking in Japan (Yin et al ., 2001), subjectscompleted a questionnaire to assess their sun exposure, pack-years of smoking history, and pot ential confounding variables.Facial wrinkles were quantified using the Daniell score, andstepwise regression analysis of the score produced the followingformula: Daniell score ¼/C01.24þ0.05/C2ageþ0.015/C2pack-yearþ0.158/C2sun exposure. Logistic regression analysis ofthe data indicated that age (odds ratio ¼7.5, 95% confidenceinterval ¼1.87–30.16), pack-year (odds ratio ¼5.8, 95% con-fidence interval ¼1.72–19.87), and sun exposure (oddsratio¼2.65, 95% confidence interval ¼1.0–7.0) independently
contribute to facial wrinkle formation (Morita, 2007). Further,tobacco smoking, and not UV exposure, is a strong predictor ofskin aging (Leung and Harvey, 2002).Significantly higher levels of matrix metalloproteinase(MMP-1) mRNA are present in the buttock dermal connectivetissue of smokers compared with non-smokers (Lahmannet al ., 2001). MMP-1 induces collagen and elastic fiberdegradation. We recently applied water-soluble tobacco

Tobacco smoke extract applied topically orintracutaneously induced a loss of collagen staining and aconcomitant increase in the ground substance in the upperdermis, indicative of collagen damage. Intraperitoneal injec-tion had no effect.

tobacco and skin wrinkling had been shown previously, thesefindings were the first direct evidence from an in vivo studythat tobacco smoke induces premature skin aging (Tanakaet al., 2007).MOLECULAR EVIDENCE THAT TOBACCO SMOKEIMPAIRS COLLAGEN METABOLISMWe next examined whether tobacco smoke extract affectscollagen directly by studying its effect on collagen metabo-lism in human skin fibroblasts. Tobacco smoke extractsimpaired collagen biosynthesis significantly in cultured skinfibroblasts (Yin et al ., 2000). In addition, production of thecollagen precursors, procollagen types I and III, wasdecreased significantly in supernatants of cultured fibroblaststreated with tobacco smoke extracts, and MMP-1 and MMP-3were induced in a dose-dependent manner (Yin et al., 2000).
The expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinaseremained unchanged, however, indicating that tobaccosmoke extract altered the ratio between these compoundsin favor of MMPs (Yin et al., 2000). Therefore, tobacco smokenot only impairs collagen biosynthesis, but also causescollagen degradation by inducing MMPs.Tobacco smoke extract also induces the non-functionallatent form of transforming growth factor- bin supernatants ofcultured skin fibroblasts (Yin et al ., 2003). Cellular respon-siveness to transforming growth factor- b1 is blocked by thisnon-functional form, and the downregulation of the trans-forming growth factor- b1 receptor results in decreasedsynthesis of extracellular matrix proteins.TOBACCO SMOKE AND THE ARYL HYDROCARBONRECEPTORIn the above studies, we used a water-soluble tobacco smokeextract that induces oxidative stress predominantly in culturedfibroblasts (Yin et al., 2000). Tobacco smoke is comprised of at
least 3,800 constituents, including numerous water-insolublepolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that trigger the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling pathway.Benzo[a]pyrene, a specific component within the class ofPAHs, was the first chemical carcinogen discovered intobacco smoke (Proctor, 2006). Tobacco smoke is asignificant source of PAH exposure, and PAHs are implicatedto be the principle carcinogenic agents in tobacco-relatedlung cancer (Proctor, 2006).The PAH 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) hasseveral pathological effects in humans through the activationof the AhR pathway. The primary mechanism underlying thechanges in gene expression induced by TCDD is activation ofthe transcription pathway comprising AhR and the AhRnuclear translocator (Arnt). AhR and Arnt are transcriptionfactors involved in the regulation of development, hypoxia
signaling, and circadian rhythms, and belong to a family ofproteins that reside in the cytoplasm in an inactive complexwith accessory proteins (Carver et al., 1998; Kazlauskas et al.,2000). Once bound to TCDD, AhR dissociates from some ofthe proteins in the inactive complex and translocates to thenucleus where it dimerizes with Arnt (Reyes et al., 1992). TheAhR/Arnt heterodimer activates the transcription of xenobio-tic-metabolizing genes (Fujii-Kuriyama et al ., 1992; Watsonand Hankinson, 1992), some of which encode proteinsinvolved in growth control, cytokines, nuclear transcription,and regulators of extracellular matrix proteolysis (Sutter et al.,1991; Yin et al., 1994). Therefore, the AhR pathway may beinvolved in the effects of tobacco smoke on skin.POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN AhR AND PREMATURE SKINAGINGThe AhR pathway is activated by TCDD and all-trans retinoic
acid, both of which increase MMP-1 expression in normalhuman keratinocytes (Murphy et al., 2004), suggesting that MMPinduction is a common mechanism underlying TCDD-inducedpathologies. MMP is regulated p redominantly at the level of geneAhRActivation of MMPs(MMP-1, 3, 7)DegradationBiosynthesis ofmatrix (collagen)Abnormal proteoglycanaccumulationAbnormal tropoelastinaccumulationProteinaseinhibitors (TIMPs)Dermal matrixbreakdownImperfect repairwrinkle formationOxidation

transcription and activity (Vincenti et al., 1996), and consensusactivator protein-1 is involved in MMP-1 transcriptional activa-tion. TCDD-induced MMP-1 expression is mediated through twoactivator protein-1 elements in the proximal promoter of theMMP-1 gene (Auble and Brinckerhoff, 1991; Benbow et al .,1999). TCDD-induced expression of MMP-1 requires bothactivator protein-1 elements (Murphy et al., 2004).Human melanocytes and some of the more metastaticmelanoma cell lines are activated by TCDD, express bothAhR and Arnt, and increase MMP expression and activity(Benbow et al., 1999). TCDD-induced MMP-1 expression ofmetastatic melanoma cells in vitro , however, does not requireactivator protein-1 elements, but is mediated throughsequences in the distal promoter region.Another environmental factor, UVB radiation, generatesthe endogenous AhR ligand 6-formylindolo[3,2- b]carbazolefrom tryptophan (Fritsche et al ., 2007), which may be a
photoproduct that initiates signaling events transferred to thenucleus and cell membrane through the activation ofcytoplasmic AhR. UVB irradiation of HaCaT keratinocytesinduces cytochrome P1A1 (CYP1A1) mRNA expression,which is inhibited through the depletion of tryptophan orby directly interfering with AhR signaling. These studiesindicate that AhR is critically involved in UVB-inducedCYP1A1 mRNA induction (Fritsche et al., 2007).To analyze the involvement of AhR in tobacco smoke-induced skin aging, we exposed primary human fibroblasts tohexane-soluble tobacco smoke extract. This extract increasedMMP-1 mRNA induction significantly in cultured humanfibroblasts, in association with a significant upregulation ofcytochrome P1B1 (CYP1B1) expression. AhR knockdownabolished the increased transcription of the AhR-dependentgene, CYP1A1/CYP1B1, induced by the extract. CYP1B1 andMMP-1 induction was abolished by the AhR pathwayinhibitors 3-methoxy-4-nitroflavone and a-naphthoflavone
(Ono et al., 2008).These studies suggest that h exane-soluble tobacco smokeextract induces MMP-1 expression in human skin fibroblaststhrough the activation of the AhR pathway. Thus, the AhRpathway may be pathogenetically involved in extrinsic skin aging.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors state no conflict of interest.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work is financially supported by a grant from Ministry of Education, Culture,Sports, Science, and Technology, Japan and by a grant from 1st Rohto award.REFERENCESAuble DT, Brinckerhoff CE (1991) The AP-1 sequence is necessary but notsufficient for phorbol induction of collagenase in fibroblasts.
