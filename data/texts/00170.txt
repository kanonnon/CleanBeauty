Polyphenols have antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory, and antineoplasticproperties. Growing evidence suggests that polyphenols may be used for the prevention of sunburnsas polyphenols decrease the damaging effects of ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB)radiation on the skin. This review was conducted to examine the evidence for use of topically
and orally ingested polyphenols in prevention of sunburns. The PubMed database was searchedfor studies that examined polyphenols and its effects on sunburns. Of the 27 studies found, 15 metthe inclusion criteria. Seven studies were conducted on human subjects and eight on animals(mice and rats). Eleven studies evaluated the effects of topical polyphenols, two studies examinedingested polyphenols, and two studies examined both topical and ingested polyphenols. Polyphenolsources included the following plant origins: green tea, white tea, cocoa, Romanian propolis (RP),Calluna vulgaris (Cv), grape seeds, honeybush, and Lepidium meyenii (maca). Eight studies examinedgreen tea. Overall, based on the studies, there is evidence that polyphenols in both oral and topicalform may provide protection from UV damage and sunburn, and thus are beneﬁcial to skin health.However, current studies are limited and further research is necessary to evaluate the efﬁcacy,
mechanism of action, and potential side effects of various forms and concentrations of polyphenols.Keywords: polyphenols; ﬂavonoids; antioxidant; sunburns; UVA; UVB; skin damage1. IntroductionUltraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) rays are damaging to the skin. Aside from agingwith the passage of time, skin may also age prematurely as a result of exposure to UVA and/or UVBlight [ 1]. Direct exposure to UVB radiation leads to DNA disruption [ 2]. As a result of overexposureto UVA or UVB light, skin begins to lose rigidity and elasticity, appearing wrinkly and rough to thetouch [ 3]. Recent research has shown elevated levels of mitochondrial DNA mutations in prematurelyaged skin following habitual exposure to UV light [ 1]. The most effective protection is avoidance ofexposure to UVB radiation (the sun), but this approach is not practical in everyday life. However,polyphenols may provide a more practical solution to protecting the skin from UVB radiation.
Polyphenols are antioxidant molecules that, like antioxidant vitamins and enzymes, help preventthe oxidative stress caused by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 4]. The antioxidant propertiesof polyphenols are primarily due to the presence of hydroxyl groups [ 2]. Typically, polyphenols areingested and then deglycosylated and absorbed across the intestinal epithelium [ 5]. There is increasingevidence for the bioavailability of polyphenols, once ingested, in systemic circulation [ 6–9]. In a studyby Clarke et al. [ 10], systemic green tea was provided in the form of capsules with a polyphenol contentof 180 mg catechins in each capsule. The total amount ingested was equal to ﬁve cups of green teadaily, with a total polyphenol content of 1080 mg green tea catechins daily. This was the ﬁrst studythat identiﬁed green tea catechin conjugates and their metabolites in plasma, blister ﬂuid, and skin

Polyphenols may be found in everyday, commonfoods such as green tea, chocolate, and red wine.Current research suggests that polyphenols may be an effective source of skin protection fromthe effects of UV radiation (UVA and UVB) [ 1]. Application and consumption of different types ofpolyphenols has been shown to lead to lower UVB-caused skin sunburn. This review will describethe recent research on the effects of the use of sources of polyphenols in protecting the skin from UVBradiation (sunburn).2. ResultsOf the 27 studies found, 15 met the inclusion criteria. Seven studies were conducted onhumans and eight on animals. Eleven studies examined topical polyphenols, two studies examinedsystemic polyphenols, and two studies examined both topical and systemic polyphenols. Polyphenols
studied included the following plant origins: green tea, white tea, cocoa, Romanian propolis (RP),Calluna vulgaris (Cv), grape seeds, honeybush, and Lepidium meyenii (maca). Eight studies examinedgreen tea.2.1. Green TeaStudies have shown a correlation between green tea consumption and decreased risk of cancerand cardiovascular disease [ 11], as well as skin protection from ultraviolet radiation (UVR) [ 12–14].Green tea contains ﬂavonoids called catechins, which include catechin (C), epicatechin (EC),epigallocatechin (EGC), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) [ 10]. After consumption of greentea, catechins undergo phase II metabolism and have been shown to be present in conjugated andunconjugated forms in plasma [14,15]; they have also been identiﬁed in many tissues [16].2.1.1. Human StudiesIn a 34-day study by Mnich et al. [ 17], 18 people aged 21 to 71 applied green tea topically on one
side of their buttocks and a placebo topical on the other; the areas were then exposed to UVB on days 5and 33 and erythema quantiﬁed on days 6 and 34. Skin biopsies followed. On day 34, the green teatopical pre-treated area had a 38.9% decrease in the amount of sunburn cells, which was shown to bestatistically signiﬁcant. These results indicate that a green tea extract topical (called OM24) is suitablefor protection from UVR and sunburn.In a study by Elmets et al. [ 18], subjects between 18 and 50 years old applied various greentea extract concentrations on their skin, ranging from 0.25% to 10%. This study showed that greentea polyphenol (GTP) applied before UV exposure decreased sunburn cells by 66%. The 2.5% GTPconcentration provided excellent protection but beneﬁcial effects were seen even with the lower doseof 0.5% GTP . In the second part of the study, skin was treated with equal concentrations of 5% GTP
and its constituents EGCG, EC, and EGC. The results showed that 5% GTP was the most effective inprotecting from erythema, and sunburn cells were reduced by 68% ( p< 0.01). DNA damage was alsoreduced by 55% ( p< 0.01). One limitation of this study is the small participant pool as only ﬁve to sixvolunteers participated in each part of the study. Also, this study mostly focuses on UVA light.A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial using systemic green tea was conducted byFarrar et al. [ 19] in the United Kingdom in 2015. The study had 50 volunteers aged 18–65 who wererandomly assigned to one of two groups: group 1 (G1) received 1080 mg/day of green tea catechins(GTC) in the form of capsules plus 100 mg/day vitamin C (to help with GTC stabilization in the gut);group 2 (G2) received placebo capsules that looked identical to G1. Before systemic GTC treatmentand 12 weeks post-treatment, buttock skin was exposed to UVR and 24 h post-exposure the skin was
examined visually for erythema. The outcome measure was minimal erythema dose (MED) (the lowest
and 12 weeks post-treatment, buttock skin was exposed to UVR and 24 h post-exposure the skin wasexamined visually for erythema. The outcome measure was minimal erythema dose (MED) (the lowestUV dose that produced visually detectable erythema, also known as the sunburn threshold) at baselineand 12 weeks post-treatment. The results showed no difference in MED between GTC group and
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2016 ,17, 1521 3 of 22placebo group ( p= 0.47). Within the GTC group, there was no difference in MED pre- and 12 weekspost-treatment ( p= 0.17). Additionally, the placebo group also showed no change in MED at 12 weekscompared to the baseline. This study failed to demonstrate that systemic GTC may protect againstUVR-induced sunburn. Some of the reasons for this ﬁnding may include inadequate GTC dose andvariable amounts of EGCG and other catechins compared to other green tea (GT) studies. Futurestudies might compare various dosages of systemic green tea.Camouse et al., 2009 [ 20] conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to assess whethergreen and white tea extracts could prevent UVR-induced Langerhans cell and DNA damage, whichcould lead to suppression of the immune system and development of skin cancer. The trial was donein the United States and included 10 subjects (age not reported) for a duration of 72 h. There were ﬁve
treatment groups: G1: No UV , no treatment; G2: UV only, no treatment; G3: vehicle + UV; G4: whitetea (WT) + UV; and G5: GT + UV . Topicals were applied to the buttock in the amount of 2.5 mg/cm2and allowed to dry for 15 min; UVR was then applied at twice the MED and the respective topical wasapplied again. Biopsies from the ﬁve sites were collected 72 h after UVR. The major outcome measureswere Langerhans cells in the epidermis (detected via anti-CD1a immunostaining) and DNA damage(detected by anti-8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (OHdG) staining). The results showed that, comparedto G1, G2 and G3 each had a 57% reduction in Langerhans cells. This suggests that the topical vehicleprovides no protection against LC damage and reduction. Compared to G3, G4 ( p= 0.002 ) and G5(p= 0.003) had a signiﬁcantly higher percentage of CD1a staining, suggesting a higher amount ofLangerhans cells per unit area of epidermis. Compared to G1, which did not receive UVR or any
treatment, G4 and G5 had a depletion of LC (22% and 35%, respectively). Additionally, there was nodifference between G4 and G5 in protection against LC depletion ( p= 0.09) suggesting the similarefﬁcacy of WT and GT extracts. The result examining DNA damage showed that, compared to G1, G2had a 40% increase and G3 a 69% increase in DNA damage. The DNA damage in G4 and G5 was notsigniﬁcantly different than in G1 ( p= 0.95 and p= 0.12). However, compared to G3, which was treatedwith vehicle and UVR, G4 and G5 had signiﬁcantly lower 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)(p= 0.002 andp= 0.001), representing less DNA damage when skin is treated with WT or GT topicals.There was no difference in skin protection from DNA damage between WT and GT. Overall, thisstudy demonstrated that topical WT and GT may protect the skin from UV damage by preventing LCdepletion and DNA damage that may be induced by UVR.
Li et al. [ 21] conducted a controlled trial in 2009 with 20 women in China to examine whether2%–5% green tea extract (GTE) topicals protect the skin from UVR-induced photoaging andphotoimmunosuppresion. Seven sites on dorsal skin were treated as follows: site 1—no UVR;site 2—UVR only; site 3—vehicle cream + UVR; site 4—2% GTE + UVR; site 5—3% GTE + UVR;site 6—4% GTE + UVR and site 7—5% GTE + UVR. Sites 3 to 7 involved application of topicals 30 minbefore UVR and 6, 24, and 48 h after last UVR. Biopsies from all sites were obtained 72 after lastUVR. Erythema was assessed via photographs of different sites. Other outcome measures included:thickness of stratum corneum (TSC) and epidermis (TE), measured by microscopy; level of cytokeratins(CK): CK5/6 and CK 16 as well as metalloproteinases (MMP): MMP-2 and MMP-9 (scored 0–3) anddensity of Langerhans cells (LC), determined by immunohistochemistry. On day 1, site 5 had the
least erythema while sites 2, 3, and 7 had the most and it worsened with subsequent UVR exposures.
density of Langerhans cells (LC), determined by immunohistochemistry. On day 1, site 5 had theleast erythema while sites 2, 3, and 7 had the most and it worsened with subsequent UVR exposures.Additionally, on day 7 sites 2, 3, and 7 had post-inﬂammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), sites 4 and 6moderate PIH, and site 5 mild PIH. Sites 2 and 3 had a signiﬁcant increase in TSC and TE after UVR.Compared to site 2, only sites 4 and 5′s topical treatments prevented TE rise ( p< 0.05). Compared tosite 1, sites 2, 3, 6, and 7 had increased TSC ( p< 0.05), while sites 4 and 5 were protected. In regards toCK5/6 and CK16—sites 2 and 3 had elevation of both after UVR and sites 4, 5, 6, and 7 had signiﬁcantprotection, with site 5 having the most protection. Additionally, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were slightlyexpressed at site 1, with high expression at sites 2, 3, and 7, and signiﬁcant reduction in both at
sites 4, 5, and 6 ( pvalues not reported). Langerhans cells were decreased by the following percentages:site 2—75%, site 3—64%, site 4—58%, site 5—46%, site 6—65%, and site 7—71%. The difference in LC
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2016 ,17, 1521 4 of 22reduction between site 1 and the others was signiﬁcant ( p< 0.05), but not between site 1 and 5. Overall,this study was able to show that GTE can protect the skin from damaging UVR and the 3% GTE wasthe most effective. MMP-2 and MMP-9 are implicated in photoaging and development of cancer andthis study showed that 2% and 3% GTE inhibited expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 post-UVR. LCsare dendritic cells found in the epidermis and the study showed that 3% GTE was protective againstLC depletion post-UVR exposure. The protective effects of GTE are not dose-dependent as 3% GTEwas shown to provide more skin protection than 4% or 5% GTE.2.1.2. Animal StudiesMeeran et al. [ 22] studied the use of ( −)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) (Figure 1), a majorpolyphenol in green tea, in 60 wild-type and IL-12 knockout (IL-12 KO) mice with 20 mice in each ofthe three treatment groups: (1) no EGCG treatment and no UVB exposure; (2) no EGCG treatment but
exposed to UVB; and (3) treatment with EGCG before UVB.Int. J. Mol.

LCs are dendritic cells found in the epidermis and the study showed that 3% GTE was protective against LC depletion post-UVR exposure. The protective effects of GTE are not dose-dependent as 3% GTE was shown to provide more skin protection than 4% or 5% GTE.  2.1.2. Animal Studies  Meeran et al. [22] studied the use of ( −)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) (Figure 1), a major polyphenol in green tea, in 60 wild-type and IL-12 knockout (IL-12 KO) mice with 20 mice in each of the three treatment groups: (1) no EGCG treatmen t and no UVB exposure; (2) no EGCG treatment but exposed to UVB; and (3) treatment with EGCG before UVB.  Figure 1.  Chemical structure of ( −)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG).
Meeran et al. [22] found that topical application of EGCG prevented skin tumor incidence and multiplicity in wild-type mice, but did not prev ent photocarcinogenesis in IL-12 KO mice. The number of sunburn cells decreased faster in wild-t ype mice treated with EGCG than in mice that received no treatment. The amount of DNA dama ge and number of sunburn cells did not differ significantly between the IL-12 KO mice group trea ted with EGCG and the untreated controls. This study showed that EGCG can prevent UVB-induced tumor development and reduce DNA damage and the amount of sunburnt cells via an IL-12-dependent mechanism. Conney et al. [23] studied the topical and oral use of green tea in 60 mice and development of skin tumors. Topical application of 3.6 mg green te a twice per week decreased skin tumors by 94%. In the systemic part of the experiment, mice were drinking water with gradually increasing green tea
concentrations; they reached 100% green tea by day 6 and continued to drink 100% green tea for a total of 25 weeks. There were six groups of 10 mice each that were placed under UV light (UVA 20%–25%, UVB 75%–80%). The number of skin tumors  was significantly decreased at week 15 ( p < 0.05) and week 25 ( p < 0.05). In experiments 1 and 2, the intensity and severity of sunburn lesions were significantly lower in groups pretreated with green  tea before UVB exposure compared to the control.  Sevin et al. [24] studied the topical application of 2% EGCG in 24 rats, applied 30 min before or after UVA exposure. The group treated with 2% EGCG 30 min before UVA exposure had a significant decrease in the number of sunburn cells at 24 h co mpared to the group that was not pretreated with 2% EGCG ( p < 0.05). Limitations of this study include the small sample size and the fact that this study mainly focused on UVA radiation rather than UVB. 2.2. Chocolate Human Studies

Chocolate Human Studies Chocolate is a natural source of polyphenols unde r the subgroup of flavon ols and its polyphenol properties as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory co uld potentially help in prevention of sunburns and other sequela of UV damage [25]. A two-grou p, parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted by Mogollon et al. [25] involved 74 women, aged 28 to 51, in Canada. The trial compared the use of high-flavonol chocolate (HFC) to low-flavonol chocolate (LFC) for 12 weeks and Figure 1. Chemical structure of ( −)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG).Meeran et al. [ 22] found that topical application of EGCG prevented skin tumor incidence andmultiplicity in wild-type mice, but did not prevent photocarcinogenesis in IL-12 KO mice. The numberof sunburn cells decreased faster in wild-type mice treated with EGCG than in mice that received
no treatment. The amount of DNA damage and number of sunburn cells did not differ signiﬁcantlybetween the IL-12 KO mice group treated with EGCG and the untreated controls. This study showedthat EGCG can prevent UVB-induced tumor development and reduce DNA damage and the amountof sunburnt cells via an IL-12-dependent mechanism.Conney et al. [ 23] studied the topical and oral use of green tea in 60 mice and development ofskin tumors. Topical application of 3.6 mg green tea twice per week decreased skin tumors by 94%.In the systemic part of the experiment, mice were drinking water with gradually increasing greentea concentrations; they reached 100% green tea by day 6 and continued to drink 100% green tea fora total of 25 weeks. There were six groups of 10 mice each that were placed under UV light (UVA20%–25%, UVB 75%–80%). The number of skin tumors was signiﬁcantly decreased at week 15 ( p< 0.05 )
and week 25 ( p< 0.05). In experiments 1 and 2, the intensity and severity of sunburn lesions weresigniﬁcantly lower in groups pretreated with green tea before UVB exposure compared to the control.Sevin et al. [ 24] studied the topical application of 2% EGCG in 24 rats, applied 30 min before orafter UVA exposure. The group treated with 2% EGCG 30 min before UVA exposure had a signiﬁcantdecrease in the number of sunburn cells at 24 h compared to the group that was not pretreated with2% EGCG ( p< 0.05). Limitations of this study include the small sample size and the fact that this studymainly focused on UVA radiation rather than UVB.2.2.

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2016 ,17, 1521 5 of 22other sequela of UV damage [ 25]. A two-group, parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled trialconducted by Mogollon et al. [ 25] involved 74 women, aged 28 to 51, in Canada. The trial comparedthe use of high-ﬂavonol chocolate (HFC) to low-ﬂavonol chocolate (LFC) for 12 weeks and measuredskin sensitivity to UVB (expressed as minimal erythema dose, MED). The total follow-up period was15 weeks. After 12 weeks, both the HFC and LFC group had a similar increase in MED. The studydid not show a statistically signiﬁcant protective effect of HFC compared to LFC on skin sensitivityto UVB. One limitation of this study is that the LFC control group received chocolate [ 25], and thereis no control group without any chocolate intake. Future studies are needed to address the potentialof chocolate polyphenols in the prevention of sunburns and should utilize a control group with nochocolate ingestion.2.3. Red Wine and Grape Seeds
2.3. Red Wine and Grape Seeds2.3.1. Human StudiesRed wine is known to have a high polyphenol content but its potential to protect skin from UVBradiation has not been fully investigated in humans [ 26]. Moehrle et al. [ 26] conducted a controlledstudy with 15 healthy male physicians, aged 28 to 51, in Germany during the spring of 2002. The studyinvestigated the topical and systemic use of three wines with different polyphenol contents. Wine Ahad the lowest polyphenol content while wine C had the highest polyphenol content. Ethanol (12%)served as the control. In the topical experiment, 5 mL of each wine and control alcohol was appliedto the back of each individual for 20 min, after which the skin was exposed to UVB and MED wasmeasured as a representation of erythema after 24 h. Eight volunteers completed the topical partof the experiment and there was no signiﬁcant difference between MED at baseline and MED local.
At least seven days were allowed between experiments. The systemic dose of wine was 6 mL wine/kgbody weight over 40 min. The results showed that Wine C oral consumption resulted in a statisticallysigniﬁcant decrease in MED systemic compared to MED at baseline ( p= 0.031). Limitations of thisstudy include the small sample size and lack of history about wine use prior to this experiment.2.3.2. Animal StudiesGrapes (Vitis Vinifera) are widely available across the world and their seeds are rich inpolyphenols [ 27], which allows them to have anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidant effects [ 28].Filip et al. [29] examined the Vitis Vinifera Burgund Mare (BM) variety in a study that included 80 miceseparated into eight groups. The polyphenol content of BM was 2.5 mg polyphenols/cm2and 4 mgpolyphenols/cm2. The groups were randomized as follows: (1) control; (2) vehicle; (3) UVB exposure;(4) vehicle + UVB; (5) BM 2.5 mg polyphenols/cm2+ UVB; (6) BM 4 mg polyphenols/cm2+ UVB ;
(7) UVB + BM 2.5 mg polyphenols/cm2; and (8) UVB + BM 4 mg polyphenols/cm2. In skin exposed toUVB radiation there was a signiﬁcant increase in the number of sunburnt cells ( p< 0.01). Pre-treatmentwith either dose of BM resulted in a decrease in the number of sunburnt cells and DNA lesions.2.4. Romanian Propolis (RP)Animal StudiesPropolis is collected from plant resins by bees and is known as one of the richest sources ofpolyphenols [ 30]. There is high variability in propolis composition dependent on geographic area,vegetation, and methods used to determine its chemical composition [ 31] but RP speciﬁcally has beenshown to have high antioxidant activity and signiﬁcant biological effects [ 32]. Bolfa et al. [ 33] conducteda controlled study in 30 female Swiss mice to investigate the topical application of romanian propolis(RP) and its photoprotective effects against UVB. RP with two different polyphenol concentrations
was used: RP1 = 3 mg and RP2 = 1.5 mg polyphenols/cm2. RP was applied topically three times over
(RP) and its photoprotective effects against UVB. RP with two different polyphenol concentrationswas used: RP1 = 3 mg and RP2 = 1.5 mg polyphenols/cm2. RP was applied topically three times over24 h without UVB radiation, before UVB or after UVB. Pre-treatment with both concentrations of RP
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2016 ,17, 1521 6 of 22minimized the amount of sunburn cells in the skin of mice ( p< 0.001). This study suggests that RPprotects skin from UVB damage. One limitation of the study is that it did not investigate the RP use inlong-term UVB exposure but RP effects are promising for topical applications.2.5. Calluna vulgaris (Cv) ExtractAnimal StudiesCalluna vulgaris (Cv) is used in folk medicine due to its anti-inﬂammatory properties, and itis known to contain polyphenols including hyperoside, quercitrin, quercetin, and kaempferol [ 34].Olteanu et al. [ 34] conducted a study with 50 mice to investigate the effects of Cv extract on the skin ofmice after exposure to UVB. The mice were divided randomly into 5 groups: (1) control (no treatment);(2) vehicle; (3) UVB exposure; (4) Cv + UVB exposure; and (5) Cv + vehicle + UVB. The results indicatedan increased number of sunburnt cells ( p< 0.001), as well as epidermal thickness and the number of
epidermal cell layers ( p< 0.001), in the control group after UVB exposure. Topical application of Cvresulted in a decreased number of sunburnt cells ( p< 0.001), less inﬂammation, and less DNA damage(p< 0.001). The plant for the study was obtained in Romania. Cv has beneﬁcial effects on the skinwhen it is applied topically before exposure to UV radiation.2.6. Honeybush (Cyclopia intermedia)The extract of the honeybush plant is rich in polyphenols; two of the most abundant polyphenolsin honeybush are hesperidin and mangiferin [ 35]. Honeybush extracts have been shown to havechemopreventive properties such as reducing oxidative stress [ 36], mutagenesis [ 37], and thedevelopment of skin tumors [ 36]. Petrova et al. [ 35] conducted a study with 70 female mice randomlydivided into seven groups in order to investigate the effect of topical honeybush extract, hesperidin,and mangiferin on the skin of mice before daily exposures to UVB for 10 days. The groups were divided
as follows: (1) positive control; (2) negative control; (3) vehicle; (4) “green” honeybush; (5) fermentedhoneybush; (6) hesperidin; and (7) mangiferin. Outcomes measured included the total polyphenolcontent and the skin′s response to sunburn. The results showed that fermented honeybush extract hadsigniﬁcantly less polyphenol content compared to “green” honeybush extract ( p< 0.05) and also lessﬂavonoids ( p< 0.05). The “green” honeybush extract had signiﬁcantly higher content of hesperidinand mangiferin than the fermented extract ( p< 0.05). Following daily UVB exposure there was asigniﬁcant increase in skin cell proliferation and, as well as sunburns indicated by erythema, peeling,thickening, and edema of the skin. The topical “green” honeybush and fermented honeybush extractsled to decreased cell proliferation more so than hesperidin and mangiferin extracts. Additionally, purehesperidin and mangiferin did not reduce sunburns and thus it can be concluded that honeybush
extract is more beneﬁcial than hesperidin and mangiferin alone in protecting the skin from sun damagecaused by daily UVB radiation.2.7. Lepidium meyenii (maca)Animal StudiesLepidium meyenii (maca) is a plant of the Peruvian highlands and maca hypocotyl is the edible partof the plant that has been used for its many medicinal properties including increase in fertility [ 38].Gonzales-Castaneda et al. [ 39] investigated whether two different extracts of maca could provideskin protection against UVB radiation. One maca extract was obtained with boiling and the otherwithout boiling. The topical extract was applied to the skin of ﬁve mice over three weeks. The resultsshowed that topical treatment with maca extract prevents skin damage caused by UVA, UVB, andUVC exposure. The limitations of this study include small sample size and short duration. However,maca extracts have potential as alternatives in skin protection from UV exposure including sunburns.
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2016 ,17, 1521 7 of 223. Discussion3.1. Natural IngredientsPolyphenols are naturally found in fruits and vegetables and in the form of ﬂavonoids, especiallyin wine, tea, chocolate, coffee, and dietary supplements [ 40]. Over the last two decades, interest hasgrown in the use of naturally based ingredients in medicine, which has led to an increase in studieson the effects of polyphenols, as antioxidants, on skin protection from UVA/UVB radiation [ 41] andcancer prevention. The cost-effective, non-invasive attribute of natural-based ingredients has been anincreasing preference of patients as compared to medical procedures or prescriptions when it comes toskin protection in particular [ 42]. It is important for health care professionals to be informed aboutthe use of natural ingredients, such as polyphenols, in preventing skin damage, sunburns, and othermechanisms that could ultimately lead to the development of skin cancers. Furthermore, knowledge
of the evidence is critical in appropriately educating the public about the potential beneﬁts and pitfallsof using natural ingredients.3.2. Polyphenol BioavailabilityGenerally, the bioavailability of polyphenols varies depending on the polyphenol forms withinthe dietary source [ 43]. Previous studies have attempted to investigate polyphenol absorption after asingle dose of polyphenol, either in food/beverage or pill form, by measuring plasma concentrationsand/or urinary excretion [ 43]. Across the multitude of classes of polyphenols, studies have showna broad range or bioavailability of the different polyphenols [ 43]. Anthocyanins, for example, area type of polyphenols commonly found in grapes. Studies have shown that an intake of 150 mg to2 g of anthocyanins led to low levels of anthocyanins in plasma, indicating poor bioavailability [ 43].Bioavailability studies have also been performed on catechins—a type of polyphenol typically found in
tea, grapes, and red wine. Studies have shown that bioavailability varies among catechins where EGCGis readily present in plasma after intake, indicating high bioavailability, whereas galloylated catechinswere never recovered in urine samples [ 43]. Across the board, studies have found extensive variancein the bioavailability of polyphenols, which may in part be driven by the nature of the study subjects’diets and potentially their levels of metabolizing enzymes [43]. Therefore, future studies will have totake additional factors into account when measuring the bioavailability of different polyphenols.3.3. Side EffectsIf administered at high doses, some antioxidants may have deleterious effects [ 2,40]. Research onthe toxicity of ﬂavonoids, a type of polyphenol typically found in dietary supplements, suggests thatat low concentrations ﬂavonoids have beneﬁcial effects on human cells, while at high concentrations
they can have toxic effects and may lead to endothelial injury [ 40]. Flavonoids exert their toxicity viaincorporation into normal human cells, where they lead to increased production of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) and thus result in DNA damage and cytotoxicity [ 40]. Consumption of isoﬂavones,a type of polyphenol commonly found in soy products, has typically been tied to a number of beneﬁtsincluding a reduced risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease [ 44–47]. However, recent studiesperformed on mice indicate that consumption of the isoﬂavone genistein may have carcinogenic effectson female reproductive organs due to its high estrogenic potency [ 48]. The studies reviewed in thisarticle did not reveal any adverse effects from the use of polyphenols they each examined. The dosageapplication of polyphenols should strive to ﬁnd a balance between maximizing the protective effectswhile minimizing the risk of toxic side effects [40,48,49].

3.4. Sunscreen and Polyphenolic Cream ComparisonRegular sunscreen protects the skin from the damaging effects of UVR by acting as a chemicalor physical barrier that absorbs or reﬂects UVR, and reduces the amount of UVR that reaches theskin [ 18]. In contrast, polyphenolic creams do not absorb a signiﬁcant amount of UVR, suggesting thatpolyphenolic creams may work through a different mechanism [ 18]. Additionally, some studies onsystemic polyphenols show protective effects on the skin, further supporting the idea that polyphenols
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2016 ,17, 1521 8 of 22may be protective via a separate mechanism [ 18]. Nevertheless, polyphenolic creams may be a suitableoption for individuals with a preference for natural-based ingredients or those who have adversereactions to regular sunscreen. Since various mechanisms may be involved, it should be exploredwhether regular sunscreen and polyphenolic cream may have an additive effect if used together.However, one of the limitations of using creams is that individuals tend not to apply them regularly.It has also been reported that individuals do not apply enough sunscreen for adequate protectionfrom damaging UVR and/or they may not apply the topical correctly [ 50]. Therefore, it is likely thatindividuals who do not use sunscreen regularly would not use polyphenolic creams either, despite thepotential beneﬁts.3.5. LimitationsInterpretation of this review should be considered in light of the limited number of studies
that were available. Many of the studies had small sample sizes and a number of studies had poorresearch design. More studies of high quality are needed to establish the efﬁcacy of different types ofpolyphenols for prevention of sunburns.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Search StrategyOn 12 July 2016 we searched PubMed for published articles that investigated the effects ofpolyphenols on sunburn. No limits were placed on the search timeframe. The search combined thekeywords “polyphenol” and “sunburn”. No ﬁlters were selected. On 22 August 2016 the search wasexpanded to include the keywords “green tea”, “sunburn”, and “sun protection”.4.2. Selection of StudiesRecords were screened by title and/or abstract to exclude studies that did not contribute toanswering the question in this review. Inclusion criteria: (1) published in English; and (2) interventionincluded a polyphenol or a plant-derived polyphenolic extract. Exclusion criteria: (1) in vitro studies;
and (2) review articles.4.3. Data ExtractionData was extracted from selected studies (Table A1) as follows: (1) polyphenol source; (2) testsubjects, country; (3) polyphenol administration; (4) polyphenol content; (5) dosage; (6) study design,duration; (7) control or placebo; (8) major outcome measures; (9) major results; and (10) reference.5. ConclusionsThere is increasing evidence that different forms of polyphenols used orally and topically maybe beneﬁcial for skin health and, more speciﬁcally, for prevention of sunburns. Many naturallyoccurring products contain polyphenols, including green tea, chocolate, red wine, Romanian propolis,Calluna vulgaris extract, grape seeds, honeybush extract, and Lepidium meyenii (maca), as reviewed here.Physicians and other health care professionals should be aware of the studies examining the beneﬁcialeffects of polyphenols as they could potentially be used as alternatives in skin care and protection from
the damaging UV rays. Our research produced a limited number of results for how polyphenols maybe used in preventing sunburn. Large-scale clinical studies are needed to assess the use of polyphenolsin topical and oral prevention of sunburns. Regardless of the ﬁndings reviewed here, prudent sunexposure, the use of sun-protective clothing, and the diligent use of sunscreens are important ﬁrst-linemethods for sun protection.Author Contributions: Both Suzana Saric and Raja K.
