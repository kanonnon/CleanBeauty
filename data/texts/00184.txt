Here weuse the FANTOM5 panelofsamples,covering the majority ofhuman tissues and celltypes,toproducean atlas of active, in vivo -transcribed enhancers. We show that enhancers share properties with CpG-poor messenger RNApromoters but produce bidirectional, exosome-sensitive, relatively short unspliced RNAs, the generation of which is stronglyrelated to enhancer activity. The atlas is used to compare regulatory programs between different cells at unprecedenteddepth, to identify disease-associated regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms, and to classify cell-type-specific and
ubiquitous enhancers. We further explore the utility of enhancer redundancy, which explains gene expression strengthrather than expression patterns. The online FANTOM5 enhancer atlas represents a unique resource for studies on cell-type-specific enhancers and gene regulation.Precise regulation of gene expression in time and space is required fordevelopment, differentiation and homeostasis1. Sequence elements withinor near core promoter regions contribute to regulation2, but promoter-distal regulatory regions like enhancers are essential in the control ofcell-type specificity1. Enhancers were originally defined as remote ele-ments that increase transcription independently of their orientation,position and distance to a promoter3. They were only recently found toinitiate RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription, producing so-calledeRNAs4. Genomic locations of enhancers can be detected by mappingof chromatin marks and transcription factor binding sites from chro-
matin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and DNase I hypersensitivesites (DHSs) (reviewed in ref. 1), but there has been no systematicanalysis of enhancer usage in the large variety of cell types and tissuespresent in the human body.Using cap analysis of gene expression5(CAGE), we show that enhan-cer activity can be detected through the presence of balanced bidirec-tional capped transcripts, enabling the identification of enhancers fromsmall primary cell populations. Based upon the FANTOM5 CAGE express-ion atlas encompassing 432 primary cell, 135 tissue and 241 cell linesamples from human6, we identify 43,011 enhancer candidates and char-acterize their activity across the majority of human cell types and tissues.The resulting catalogue of transcribed enhancers enables classificationof ubiquitous and cell-type-specific enhancers, modelling of physicalinteractions between multiple enhancers and TSSs, and identification of

potential disease-associated regulatory single nucleotide polymorph-isms (SNPs).Bidirectional capped RNAs identify active enhancersThe FANTOM5 project has generated a CAGE-based transcriptionstart site (TSS) atlas across a broad panel of primary cells, tissues andcell lines covering the vast majority of human cell types6. Within thatdata set, well-studied enhancers often have CAGE peaks delineatingnucleosome-deficient regions (NDRs) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Todetermine whether this is a genera l enhancer feature, FANTOM5 CAGE(Supplementary Table 1) was superimposed on active (H3K27ac-marked)enhancers defined by HeLa-S3 ENCODE ChIP-seq data7.

were observed in other cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Enhancer-associated reverse and forward strand transcription initiation eventswere, on average, separated by 180 base pairs (bp) and corresponded tonucleosome boundaries (Supplementary Figs 3 and 4). As a class, activeHeLa-S3 enhancers had 231-fold more CAGE tags than polycomb-repressed enhancers, indicating that transcription is a marker for activeusage. Indeed, ENCODE-predicted enhancers7with significant reporteractivity8had greater CAGE expression levels than those lacking reporteractivity ( P,4310222, Mann–Whitney Utest). A lenient thresholdon enhancer expression increased the validation rate of ENCODEenhancers from 27% to 57% (Supplementary Fig. 5).Although capped RNAs of protein-coding gene promoters werestrongly biased towards the sense direction, similar levels of cappedRNA in both directions were detected at enhancers (Fig. 1b and Sup-plementary Fig. 2b, c). Thus, bidirectional capped RNAs is a signature
feature of active enhancers. On this basis, we identified 43,011 enhan-cer candidates across 808 human CAGE libraries (see SupplementaryText and Supplementary Figs 6–8). Interestingly, the candidates weredepleted of CpG islands (CGI) and repeats (with the exception ofneural stem cells, see ref. 9).To confirm the activity of newly identified candidate enhancers, werandomly selected 46 strong, 41 moderate and 36 low activity enhancers(as defined by CAGE tag frequency in HeLa cells) and examined theiractivity using enhancer reporter assays compared to randomly selecteduntranscribed loci with regulatory potential in HeLa-S3 cells: 15 DHSs10,26 ENCODE-predicted ‘strong enhancers’7and 20 enhancers definedas in Fig. 1a (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Whereas 67.4–73.9% ofthe CAGE-defined enhancers showed significant reporter activity, only20–33.3% of the untranscribed candidate regulatory regions were active(Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 9a). The same trend was observed in
HepG2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 10a, b). Corresponding promoter-lessconstructs showed that the enhancer transcription read-through isnegligible (Supplementary Fig. 9b, c). Many CAGE-defined enhancersoverlapped predicted ENCODE ‘strong enhancers’ or ‘TSS’ states (25%and 62%, respectively, for HeLa-S3), but there was no substantial differ-ence in validation rates between thes e classes (Supplementary Fig. 10c, d).In summary, active CAGE-defined enhancers were much more likely tobe validated in functional assays than untranscribed candidate enhan-cers defined by histone modifications or DHSs.Initiation and fate of enhancer RNAs versus mRNAsRNA-seq data from matching primary cells and tissues showed that,95% of RNAs originating from enhancers were unspliced and typ-ically short (median 346 nucleotides)—a striking difference to mRNAsab c024DensityChromatin-definedenhancer RefSeqTSSBalanced 100% – strand 100% + strandDirectionality0.000.250.500.75High CAGE

(19% unspliced, median 1,256 nucleotides) (Fig. 2a and SupplementaryFig. 11a–c). Unlike TSSs of mRNAs, which are enriched for predicted59splice sites but depleted of downstream polyadenylation signals11,12,enhancers showed no evidence of associated downstream RNA pro-cessing motifs, and thus resemble antisense promoter upstream tran-scripts (PROMPTs)11(Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 11d). Most CAGE-defined enhancers gave rise to nuclear ( .80%) and non-polyadenylated(,90%) RNAs13(Supplementary Fig. 11e). Based on RNA-seq, fewenhancer RNAs overlap exons of known protein-coding genes or largeintergenic noncoding RNAs (9 and 1 out of 4,208 enhancers detected,respectively), indicating that they are not a substantial source of alter-native promoters for known genes (as in ref. 14).TSS-associated, uncapped small RNAs (TSSa-RNAs), attributed toRNAPII protection and found immediately downstream of mRNATSSs15,16, were detectable in the same positions downstream of enhan-
cer TSSs (Supplementary Fig. 12), indicating that RNAPII initiation atenhancer and mRNA TSSs is similar. Indeed, CAGE-defined enhancerTSSs resembled the proximal position-specific sequence patterns ofnon-CGI RefSeq TSSs (Fig. 2c and Supp lementary Fig. 13a). Furthermore,de novo motif analysis revealed sequence signatures in CAGE-definedenhancers closely resembling non-CGI promoters (Fig. 2d and Sup-plementary Fig. 13b).Because of the similarity with PROMPTs, we reasoned that cappedenhancer RNAs might be rapidly degraded by the exosome. Indeed,small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of the SKIV2L2 (also knownas MTR4) co-factor of the exosome complex resulted in a median 3.14-fold increase of capped enhancer-RNA abundance (Fig. 2e and Sup-plementary Fig. 14a, b), but only a negligible increase at mRNA TSSs.This increasing trend is similar to that of PROMPT regions upstreamof TSSs, although the increase of enhancer RNAs was significantly
higher ( P,4.6310267, Mann–Whitney Utest; Fig. 2e and Supplemen-tary Fig. 14b, c). Thus, the bidirectional transcriptional activity observedat enhancers is also present at promoters, as suggested previously17,but in promoters only the antisense RNA is degraded. Furthermore,the CAGE expression of enhancers in control and SKIV2L2 -depletedcells was proportional (Supplementary Fig. 14d), indicating that vir-tually all identified enhancers produce exosome-sensitive RNAs. Thenumber of detectable bidirectional CAGE peaks increased 1.7-foldupon SKIV2L2 depletion and novel enhancer candidates had on averagesimilar, but weaker, chromatin modification signals compared to controlHeLa cells (Supplementary Fig. 14e).CAGE identifies cell-specific enhancer usageTo test whether CAGE expression can identify cell-type-specific enhan-cer usage in vivo , ChIP-seq (H3K27ac and H3K4me1), DNA methyla-tion and triplicate CAGE analyses were performed in five primary
blood cell types, and compared to published DHS data (http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/, Supplementary Table 4). CAGE-definedenhancers were strongly supported by proximal H3K4me1/H3K27acpeaks (71%) and DHSs (87%) from the same cell type. Conversely,H3K4me1 and H3K27ac supported only 24% of DHSs distal to pro-moters and exons and only 4% of DHSs overlapped CAGE-definedenhancers (Supplementary Fig. 15), indicating that a minority of pro-moter-distal DHSs identify enhancers. From the opposite perspective,only11% of H3K4me1/H3K27ac loci overlapped CAGE-defined enhan-cers and untranscribed loci showed weaker ChIP-seq signals thantranscribed ones (Supplementary Fig. 16). Moreover, there was a clearcorrelation between CAGE, DNase I hypersensitivity, H3K4me1 andH3K27ac for CAGE-defined enhancers expressed in blood cells (Fig. 3a).Accordingly, cell-type-specific enhancer expression corresponds to cell-type-specific histone modifications (Fig. 3b). The majority of selected
cell-type-specific enhancers could be validated in corresponding cell
type-specific histone modifications (Fig. 3b). The majority of selectedcell-type-specific enhancers could be validated in corresponding celllines and were associated with cell-type-specific DNA demethylation(Supplementary Text, Supplementary Fig. 17 and SupplementaryTables 5–8, see also ref. 18). Thus, bidirectional CAGE pairs are robustpredictors for cell-type-specific enhancer activity.An atlas of transcribed enhancers across human cellsThe FANTOM5 CAGE library collection6enables the dissection ofenhancer usage across cell types and tissues comprehensively sampledacross the human body. Clustering based on enhancer expression clearlygrouped functionally related samples together (Fig. 3c and Supplemen-tary Figs 18 and 19). Although fetal and adult tissue often groupedtogether, two large fetal-specific clusters were identified: one brain-specific (pink) and one with diverse tissues (green). The fetal-braincluster is associated with enhancers that are located close to known
neural developmental genes, including NEUROG2 ,SCRT2 ,POU3F2andMEF2C (Supplementary Fig. 18b), for which gene expression pat-terns correlate with enhancer RNA abundance across libraries, suggest-ing regulatory interaction (see below). The results corroborate the func-tional relevance of these enhancers for tissue-specific gene expressionand indicate that they are an important part of the regulatory programsof cellular differentiation and organogenesis.To confirm that candidate enhancers can drive tissue-specific geneexpression in vivo , five evolutionarily conserved CAGE-defined humanenhancers (including the POU3F2 andMEF2C -proximal enhancersaCAGE-defined enhancers-1kb+1kb-1kb+1kb-1kb+1kbH3K4me1 H3K27ac-10CAGE DNase-10 -6 -1 -4CAGEreplicatesRelativepositionc b–1 kb+1 kb0rep 1rep 3rep 2CD19 CD4 CD8 CD56 CD14Whole bloodCerebellumFetal brainBrainHeartLymphatic organsFetal tissuesReproductive or gansCell type0.000.010.000.020.000.010.0000.03

identified above) were tested via Tol2-mediated transgenesis in zebra-fish embryos. We observed tissue-specific enhancer activity with 3 of 5fragments, which corresponded to the human enhancer tissue express-ion (Fig. 4). None of three control fragments without CAGE signalactivated the GATA2 promoter (Supplementary Table 9). Althoughthe sample size is not high enough to reliably estimate the validationrates in zebrafish, the correlation between the enhancer usage profilesin zebrafish to those defined in human by CAGE is notable.We grouped the primary cell and tissue samples into larger, mutu-ally exclusive cell type and organ/tissue groups (referred to as facets),respectively, with similar function or morphology (SupplementaryTables 10 and 11). Figure 5 summarizes how many enhancers weredetected in each facet and the degree of facet-specific CAGE express-ion (see also Supplementary Fig. 21). From the data we can drawseveral conclusions:
several conclusions:First, the majority of detected enhancers within any facet are notrestricted to that facet. Exceptions, where facets use a higher fractionof specific enhancers, include immune cells, neurons, neural stemcells and hepatocytes amongst the cell-type facets, and brain, blood,liver and testis amongst the organ/tissue facets.Second, despite their apparent promiscuity, enhancers are moregenerally detected in a much smaller subset of samples than mRNAtranscripts (Supplementary Figs 21 and 22a, b), consistent with cell-line studies7and the higher specificity of ncRNAs in general13. Facetsin which we detect many enhancers typically also have a higher frac-tion of facet-specific enhancers (Supplementary Fig. 22c, d).Third, the number of detected expressed enhancers and mRNAtranscripts is correlated (Supplementary Fig. 21b), but the numberof detected expressed gene transcripts ( .1 tag per million mapped reads
(TPM)) is 19–34 fold larger than the number of detected enhancerswith the cut-offs used. Noteworthy exceptions include blood and immunecells, testis, thymus and spleen, which have high enhancer/gene ratios.Conversely, smooth and skeletal muscle and skin, bone and epithelia-related cells have low ratios. Differential exosome activity between celltypes might affect these results, but there was no correlation betweenSKIV2L2 mRNA expression and the number of enhancers detected(Supplementary Fig. 22e, f).As expected, consensus motifs of known key regulators are over-represented in corresponding facet-specific enhancers, for instanceETS, C/EBP and NF- kB in monocyte-specific enhancers, RFX andSOX in neurons, and HNF1 and HNF4a in hepatocytes (Supplemen-tary Fig. 23). Notably, the AP1 motif appears to be enriched across allfacets, perhaps associated with a general role for AP1 in regulatingopen chromatin19.Expression clustering reveals ubiquitous enhancers
Hierarchical clustering of enhancers by facet expression revealed asmall subset of enhancers (200 or 247, defined by primary cell or tissuefacets, respectively) expressed in the large majority of facets (Sup-plementary Text, Supplementary Figs 24 and 25, and Supplemen-tary Tables 12 and 13). Compared to other enhancers, these ubiquitous(u-) enhancers are 8 times more likely to overlap CGIs and they aretwice as conserved (Supplementary Fig. 26a–c). U-enhancers overlaptypical chromatin enhancer marks but have higher H3K4me3 signal(Supplementary Fig. 26d). Although they produce significantly longerncRNAs than other enhancers (median 530 nucleotides, P,1.531028,Mann–Whitney Utest), the transcripts remain predominantly ( ,78%)unspliced and significantly shorter ( P,4.2310218, Mann–WhitneyUtest) than mRNAs (Supplementary Figs 27 and 28), do not shareexons with known genes, and are exosome-sensitive (Supplementary
Fig. 14b). Therefore, it is unlikely that these are novel mRNA promo-ters. They are also highly enriched for P300 and cohesin ChIP-seqpeaks20and RNAPII-mediated ChIA-PET signal21compared to other
Fig. 14b). Therefore, it is unlikely that these are novel mRNA promo-ters. They are also highly enriched for P300 and cohesin ChIP-seqpeaks20and RNAPII-mediated ChIA-PET signal21compared to otherenhancers (Supplementary Fig. 26d). These results indicate thatu-enhancers comprise a small but distinct subset of enhancers, whichprobably has specific regulatory functions used by virtually everyhuman cell.Linking enhancer usage with TSS expressionA major challenge is to link enhancers to their target genes21,22.Uniquely, FANTOM5 CAGE allows for direct comparison betweentranscriptional activity of the enhancer and of putative target geneTSSs across a diverse set of human cells. Based on pairwise expressioncorrelation, nearly half (40%) of the inferred TSS-associated enhan-cers (Methods) were linked with the nearest TSS, and 64% of enhan-cers have at least one correlated TSS within 500 kilobases. Severalassociations (10,260; 15.3%) are supported by ChIA-PET (RNAPII-
mediated) interaction data21, and the supported fraction increaseswith the correlation threshold (Supplementary Fig. 29a). The fractionof supported associations is 4.8-fold higher than that of associationspredicted from DNase I hypersensitivity correlations10(20.6% versus4.3%, at the same correlation threshold), indicating that transcriptionis a better predictor of regulatory targets than chromatin accessibility.Conserved sequence motifs and ChIP-seq peaks also co-occurredsignificantly in associated enhancer-promoter pairs (Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR ),0.05, binomial test), suggest-ing an additive or synergistic cooperation between enhancers andpromoters at RNAPII foci.On average, a RefSeq TSS was associated with 4.9 enhancers and anenhancer with 2.4 TSSs and we observed different regulatory archi-tectures around genes (Supplementary Fig. 30). For example, at thebeta-globin locus the CAGE expression patterns of four locus control
region hypersensitive sites are highly correlated (Pearson’s rbetween0.88 and 0.98) with the expression of known target genes23,24HBG2andHBD , and to some extent HBG1 .dadv ivyslivhin spfbmidCRE1 CRE3 CRE2ysl mufpfpnt BrainSalivary glandBlood vessel ofEndothelial cell ofKidneyepithelial cellepithelial cellepithelial cellhepatic sinusoidUrothelial cellRespiratory abcNeuronNeural stem cellAstrocyteBrainHuman enhancer expression (TPM)NeuronAstrocyteSpinal cordBrain010308100 μm100 μm100 μm100 μm100 μm100 μmFigure 4 |In vivo validation in zebrafish of tissue-specific enhancers.Validations of in vivo activity of CAGE-defined human enhancers CRE1, CRE2and CRE3 in zebrafish embryos at long-pec stage.

These observations call for computational models of enhancer regu-lation, in which multiple enhancers may work in concert to enhancethe expression of a gene. To this end, we focused on 2,206 RefSeq TSSsfor which the joint expression of nearby enhancers (the closest tenenhancers within 500 kb) is highly predictive of the gene expression.Model shrinkage showed that in most cases, only one to three enhancersare necessary to explain the expression variance observed in the linkedgene, and generally proximal enhancers are more predictive than distalones (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Fig. 29b–d and Supplementary Text).

same expression pattern is that they might confer higher transcriptionaloutput of a gene25,26. Indeed, the number of highly correlated (redund-ant) enhancers close to TSSs (Supplementary Methods) increased withthe observed maximal TSS expression over all libraries (Fig. 6b), imply-ing that these enhancers are redundant in terms of transcription patternsbut additive in terms of expression strength. Expression redundancy isalso common in genomic clusters of closely spaced enhancers (24% of815 identified genomic clusters, Supplementary Table 15). These areassociated with TSSs of genes invol ved in immune and defence responsesand, as suggested by a previous study27, have a higher expression thanother enhancer-associated genes (eightfold increase on average).Disease-associated SNPs are enriched in enhancersMany disease-associated SNPs are located outside of protein-codingexons and a large proportion of human genes display expression
polymorphism28. Using the NHGRI genome-wide association studies(GWAS) catalogue29and extending the compilation of lead SNPs withproxy SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium (similar to refs 30, 31),we identified diseases/traits whose associated SNPs overlapped enhan-cers, promoters, exons and random regions significantly more thanexpected by chance (Fisher’s exact test P,0.01, Supplementary Table 16).Disease-associated SNPs were over-represented in regulatory regionsto a greater extent than in exons (Fig. 6c). For many traits where enricheddisease-associated SNPs were within enhancers, enhancer activity wasdetected in pathologically relevant cell types (Fig. 6d and SupplementaryFigs 31 and 32). Examples include Graves’ disease-associated SNPsenriched in enhancers that are expressed predominantly in thyroidtissue, and similarly lymphocytes for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.As a proof of concept, we validated the impact of two disease-associated
regulatory SNPs within enhancers (Supplementary Fig. 33).ConclusionsThe data presented here demonstrate that bidirectional capped RNAs,as measured by CAGE, are robust predictors of enhancer activity in acell. Transcription is only measured at a fraction of chromatin-definedenhancers and few untranscribed enhancers show potential enhanceractivity. This implies that many chromatin-defined enhancers are notregulatory active in that particular cellular state, but may be active inother cells of the same lineage32or are pre-marked for fast regulatoryactivity upon stimulation33. Of course, given the relative instability ofenhancer RNAs some chromatin-defined sites may be active but fallbelow the limits of detection of CAGE.Our results show that position-specific sequence signals upstreamof the transcription initiation sites and the production of small,uncapped RNAs immediately downstream is present at both enhan-cers and mRNA promoters, suggesting similar mechanisms of ini-
tiation. Previous studies (for example refs 10, 34, 35) suggested thatpromoters and enhancers differ in motif composition. This view is notsupported by the larger FANTOM5 data set. Instead, the differencesreflect the local G 1C content because transcribed enhancers tend toharbour low G 1C content motifs like non-CGI promoters. Featuresdistinguishing enhancers from mRN A promoters are (1) enhancer RNAsare exosome-sensitive regardless of direction whereas (sense) mRNAshave a longer half-life than their antisense counterpart; (2) enhancerRNAs are short, unspliced, nuclear and non-polyadenylated and (3)enhancers have downstream polyadenylation and 5 9splice motif fre-quencies at genomic background level similar to antisense PROMPTs,whereas mRNAs are depleted of termination signals and enriched for59splice sites11,12.The collection of active enhancers presented here provides a resourcethat complements the activity of the ENCODE consortium7across a
much greater diversity of tissues and cellular states. It has clear appli-
that complements the activity of the ENCODE consortium7across amuch greater diversity of tissues and cellular states. It has clear appli-cations in human genetics, to narrow the search windows for func-tional association, and for the definition of regulatory networks thatunderpin the processes of cellular differentiation and organogenesis inhuman development.METHODS SUMMARYSingle-molecule HeliScopeCAGE data was generated as described elsewhere6.Sequencing and processing of ribosomal RNA-depleted RNAs, short RNAs andH3K27ac or H3K4me1 ChIPs as well as the processing of publicly availableDNase-seq data are described in the Methods.Putative enhancers were identified from bidirectionally transcribed loci havingdivergent CAGE tag clusters separated by at most 400 bp (described in Sup-plementary Fig. 6a). We required loci to be divergently transcribed in at leastone FANTOM5 sample, defined by CAGE tag 5 9ends within 200 bp divergent
strand-specific windows immediately flanking the loci midpoints. The expressionof each enhancer in each FANTOM5 sample was quantified as the normalizedsum of strand-specific sums of CAGE tags in these windows. A sample-set widedirectionality score, D, for each locus over aggregated normalized reverse, R, andforward, F, strand window-expression values across all samples, D5(F2R)/(F1R), were then used to filter putative enhancers to have low, non-promoter-like, directionality scores ( jDj,0.8). Further filtering ensured enhancers to belocated distant to TSSs and exons of protein- and noncoding genes.Motif enrichment analyses were done using HOMER36. Regulatory targets ofenhancers were predicted by correlation tests using the sample-set wide express-ion profiles of all enhancer-promoter pairs within 500 kb. The regulatory effectsof multiple enhancers were modelled using linear regression followed by lasso-based model-shrinkage37.
based model-shrinkage37.Enhancer activity was tested in vivo in zebrafish embryos using Tol2-mediatedtransgenesis38. Expression patterns were documented at 48 h post fertilizationusing.200 eggs per construct. Large-scale in vitro validations on randomlyselected enhancers were performed using firefly/ Renilla luciferase reporter plas-mids with enhancer sequences cloned upstream of an EF1 abasal promoterseparated by a synthetic polyA signal/transcriptional pause site in a modifiedpGL4.10 (Promega) vector (Supplementary Fig. 9d).

METHODSCAGE data. Single molecule HeliScopeCAGE39data was generated as describedelsewhere6. We used a set of 432 primary cell, 135 tissue and 241 cell line samplesthat passed quality control measures of .500,000 Q20 Delve (T.L. et al. , manu-script in preparation) mapped CAGE tags, RNA integrity and reproducibility (forfurther details, see ref. 6).Proof of concept analysis. We defined silent and active enhancers from ENCODEHeLa-S3, GM12878 and K562 broad peaks, downloaded from the UCSC ENCODErepository, according to the co-existence of histone modifications H3K4me1,H3K27ac and H3K27me3. Active enhancers were defined as co-localized H3K4me1and H3K27ac peaks with no H3K27me3 peak, whereas silent enhancers wereconsidered loci with H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 peaks but no H3K27ac peak.Loci were filtered to be located distant to TSSs (500 bp) and exons (200 bp) of protein-coding genes, multi-exonic noncoding genes and mRNAs (from ENSEMBL,
GENCODE (v10), RefSeq and UCSC, downloaded January 12, 2012), and otherlncRNAs from a gene-centric set derived from literature40as well as manuallyannotated sense-antisense pairs (coding-noncoding and noncoding-noncodingsense-antisense pairs) with 5 9expressed sequence tag (EST) and complementaryDNA support, and 5 9ESTs with no locus with protein-coding capacity. Trans-criptional differences between active and silent enhancer sets were determined bycomparing the average number of FANTOM5 CAGE tag 5 9ends from the sameENCODE cell lines (pooled triplicates) in a window 6300 bp around the H3K4me1peak mid points.The active enhancer sets of HeLa-S3, GM12878 and K562 cells were thencentred on proximal (within 200 bp) P300 ENCODE binding site peaks (jointP300 and GATA1 peaks for K562) to derive centre positions. FANTOM5 CAGEdata from the same ENCODE cell lines (pooled triplicates) were then overlaidover these centred enhancer regions and the absence (0) and presence (1) of (one
or more) CAGE tag 5 9ends in 10 bp non-overlapping windows were determinedand an average profile was calculated to assess the average bidirectional pattern oftranscription at chromatin-derived enhancers.Pooled CAGE data from all FANTOM5 libraries (described above) were fur-ther overlaid with these regions and a directionality score based on the aggregateof CAGE tags falling within 6300 bp from the centre positions were calculated todetermine potential strand bias. For comparison, we repeated the same calcula-tions for genomic regions 6300 bp around TSSs of RefSeq protein coding genes.Directionality was calculated as (F - R) / (F 1R), where F and R is the sum of CAGEtags aligned on the forward and reverse strand, respectively. Directionality close to-1 or 1 indicates a unidirectional behaviour while 0 indicates perfectly balancedbidirectional transcription.Positional cross correlations were calculated between reverse and forward
CAGE tag 5 9ends at ChIP-seq-derived active HeLa-S3 and GM12878 enhancercentre positions (as determined by P300 peaks) 6300 bp (maximum lag 300) toidentify theirmost likely separation. Cross correlations were also calculated in 300 bpwindows (maximum lag 150) flanking the enhancer centres between CAGE 5 9endsand ENCODE H2A.Z signals (from the same cell line) for HeLa-S3 and GM12878as well as between CAGE 5 9ends and 5 9ends of ENCODE GM12878 micrococcalnuclease-digested nucleosome sequencing (MNase-seq) reads (9 pooled repli-cates). In the latter analysis, correlations were made using reads on the same strand.Pooled, unique CAGE tags (in which only one CAGE tag per bp was counted) wereconsidered in all correlation analyses and enhancers were weighed according to theaggregated signal before subsequent averaging over lags not to make any library orenhancer have an undue influence.Reporter activity of ENCODE enhancers in relation to transcriptional status.

All results onnon-scrambled sequences were considered, regardless of the level of conservation.198 out of 738 tested K562 enhancers and 307 out of 1,136 tested HepG2 enhancershad significant enhancer reporter activity (as determined by the original publica-tion). We determined the expression in 401 bp windows centred on mid points ofENCODE-predicted enhancers using FANTOM5 CAGE from the same cell lines.We further calculated the false discovery rate after a minimum expression thresh-old in the interval [0,0.5] TPM, as the fraction of non-significant enhancers amongthose fulfilling the expression cutoff.Identification of bidirectionally transcribed loci. Bidirectionally transcribed
loci were defined from a set of 1,714,047 forward and 1,597,186 reverse strandCAGE tag clusters (TCs) supported by at least two CAGE tags in at least onesample (TCs defined in ref. 6). Only TCs not overlapping antisense TCs wereused. We identified 1,261,036 divergent (reverse-forward) TC pairs separated byat most 400 bp and merged all such pairs containing the same TC, while at thesame time avoiding overlapping forward and reverse strand transcribed regions(prioritization by expression ranking), which resulted in 200,171 bidirectionalloci (procedure illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 6a). A centre position wasdefined for each bidirectional locus as the mid position between the rightmostreverse strand TC and leftmost forward strand TC included in the merged bidir-ectional pair. Each bidirectional locus was further associated with two 200 bpregions immediately flanking the centre position, one (left) for reverse strand
transcription and one (right) for forward strand transcription, in a divergentmanner. The merged bidirectional pairs were further required to be bidirection-ally transcribed (CAGE tags supporting both windows flanking the centre) in atleast one individual sample, and to have a greater aggregate of reverse CAGE tags(over all FANTOM5 samples) than forward CAGE tags in the 200 bp regionassociated with reverse strand transcription, and vice versa. These filtering stepsresulted in 78,555 bidirectionally transcribed loci.Expression quantification of bidirectionally transcribed loci and prediction ofenhancers. We quantified the expression of bidirectional loci for each strand and200 bp flanking window in each of the 432 primary cell, 135 tissue and 241 cell linesamples separately by counting the CAGE tags whose 5 9ends were located withinthese windows. The expression values of both flanking windows were normalized
by converting tag counts to tags per million mapped reads (TPM) and furthernormalization between samples was done using the relative log expression (RLE)normalization procedure in edgeR41. The number of CAGE tags aligned on ChrMwas subtracted from the total number of aligned CAGE tags in each library beforenormalization. The normalized expression values from both windows were usedto calculate a sample-set wide directionality score, D, for each enhancer overaggregated normalized reverse, R, and forward, F, strand expression values acrossall samples (Supplementary Fig. 6a); D5(F2R)/(F1R).Dranges between 21and 1 and specifies the bias in expression to reverse and forward strand, respect-ively ( D50 means 50% reverse and 50% forward strand expression, while jDjclose to 1 indicates unidirectional transcription). A directionality score calculatedfrom pooled data is a good estimate of sample directionality (Supplementary
Fig. 6b). Each bidirectional locus was assigned one expression value for eachsample by summing the normalized expression of the two flanking windows.Bidirectional loci were further filtered to have low, non-promoter-like, direc-
sample by summing the normalized expression of the two flanking windows.Bidirectional loci were further filtered to have low, non-promoter-like, direc-tionality scores ( jDj,0.8) and to be located distant to TSSs and exons of protein-and noncoding genes (see ‘Proof of concept analysis’ above for details). Thisresulted in a final set of 43,011 putative enhancers.We further tested whether the expression level for each sample and candidateenhancer was significantly greater than the genomic background (see construc-tion of random genomic background regions below). A Pvalue was calculated foreach enhancer expression value for each primary cell, tissue and cell line sampleby counting the fraction of random genomic regions with greater expression levelin the same sample. Enhancers with Pvalues less than 0.001 and Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted FDR ,0.05 was considered transcribed in that sample. Thisanalysis yielded binary expression values, which were used for constructing
enhancer sets associated with each sample. In total, 38,554 enhancers were tran-scribed at a significant expression level in at least one primary cell or tissuesample. Below, we refer to this set as the ‘robust set’ of enhancers and indicatewhenever it was used. For all analyses, we use the whole (‘permissive’) set of43,011 enhancers if not otherwise mentioned.Construction of random genomic background regions. We randomly sampled100,000 genomic regions of 401 bp that were distal to TSSs and exons of knowngenes (same as the filtering procedure described above for bidirectionally tran-scribed loci). These were further filtered to not overlap with our set of 43,011predicted enhancers, which yielded 98,942 random genomic regions whose express-ion levels were quantified and normalized in the same manner as described forbidirectional loci (above).Correlation between ENCODE epigenomic data and CAGE-defined enhan-
cers. Using the UCSC ENCODE repository data (downloaded and pooled 26March 2012), we assessed the signal of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII), the pooledtranscription factor super track (all TFs), CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), E1Abinding protein P300, DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) and two histonemarks: H3K4me1 and H3K27ac around enhancers, TSSs and random genomicsites.Large scale enhancer reporter validations. We randomly selected 125 CAGE-defined enhancers with significantly higher expression than random genomicregions in at least two out of three HeLa-S3 replicates. These were groupedaccording to Hela-S3 expression tertiles: low (36), mid-level (41) and strong(46). These could be split up further according to overlap (mid position) withcombined ENCODE (release January 2011) segmentations of Segway42andChromHMM43chromatin state prediction: 25, 27 and 14 strongly, mid-level andlowly expressed CAGE enhancer overlapped ENCODE state ‘E’ (‘strong enhancer’)
whereas 21, 16 and 22 strongly, mid-level and lowly expressed CAGE enhanceroverlapped ENCODE state ‘TSS’.We further randomly selected 26 and 15 untranscribed (negligible amount ofoverlapping FANTOM5 HeLa-S3 CAGE tags) 500 bp regions centred on midRESEARCH ARTICLEMacmillan Publishers Limited.

positions of HeLa-S3 E states and HeLa-S3 ENCODE DHSs. Two literature-derived44HeLa-S3 positive enhancers and 4 random regions (see ‘Constructionof random genomic background regions’) were used for comparison. For com-parison, we also randomly selected 20 manually defined untranscribed HeLa-S3chromatin-defined active enhancers (see ‘Proof of concept analysis’).PCR primers for the amplification of enhancer and control regions weredesigned using the PerlPrimer tool45, and purchased from Operon Ltd Primersincluded BamHI or SalI restriction sites for cloning and sequences are listed in Sup-plementary Tables 2 and 3. Control fragments ranged between 420 and 1,452 bp.Enhancer fragments usually included a 500 bp window around the mid-point ofour predicted enhancers and depending on the availability of unique primersequences, enhancer fragments ranged between 470 and 840 bp.We inserted an EF1 abasal promoter fragment into HindIII and NheI sites of
the multiple cloning site in the promoter-less pGL4.10 (Promega) to construct thepGL4.10EF1 avector. We next removed the BamHI and SalI containing fragmentlocated downstream of the SV40 late poly(A) signal, and re-inserted the fragmentat the SpeI site that is located upstream of the synthetic poly(A) signal/transcrip-tional pause site to generate modified versions of pGL4.10EF1 aand pGL4.10 (seeSupplementary Fig. 9d).Enhancer and control regions were PCR-amplified using KOD plus polymer-ase (Toyobo) from HEK-293T gDNA, digested with BamHI and SalI (TakaraBio), and purified using the E-Gel SizeSelect system (Life Technologies). Five mlo fpurified PCR products were ligated with 100 ng of the BamHI- and SalI-digestedmodified pGL4.10EF1 aand pGL4.10 plasmids using Ligation-high (Toyobo),and transformed into DH5 acompetent cells (Toyobo). Correct insertion of thePCR products into the plasmids was checked by colony PCR. Vectors were
purified using the QIAGEN Plasmid Plus 96 Miniprep Kit (Qiagen).HeLa-S3 cells (JCRB Cell Bank) were cultured in MEM (WAKO) supplemen-ted with 10% FBS (Nichirei Bioscience Inc., lot no. 7G0031), 100 Units ml21penicillin and 100 mgm l21streptomycin (both Life Technologies). HepG2 Cells(RIKEN BRC) were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with10% FBS (Nichirei Bioscience Inc., Lot No. 7G0031), and MEM (WAKO) sup-plemented with 10% FBS (Nichirei Bioscience Inc., lot no. 7G0031), 100 Unitspenicillin and 100 mgm l21streptomycin (Life Technologies). Cell lines wereseeded into 96 well plates at a density of 7.5 3103cells per well one day beforetransfection. Firefly luciferase reporter plasmids (190 ng) and 10 ng of pGL4.73Renilla luciferase plasmid (Promega) were co-transfected into HepG2 or HeLa-S3cells using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’sinstruction. Each transfection was independently performed three times. After 24 h,
the luciferase activities were measured by GloMax 96 Microplate luminometer(Promega) using the Dual-glo luciferase assay system (Promega) according to themanufacturer’s instruction.Sequence motif analysis on global CAGE enhancer and promoter sets. Tocompare motif signatures characterizing bidirectionally transcribed enhancers(permissive set) with those of CAGE-defined promoters, we used the set of184,827 robust human CAGE clusters defined by ref. 6 separated into 61,322CGI and 123,505 nonCGI-associated clusters. We made further subsets of theseCAGE clusters, contingent on their overlap with annotated TSSs from Refseq andGencode. We merged overlapping extended CAGE clusters ( 2300,150; basedon the robust cluster set; average size nonCGI: 422 bp; average size CGI: 544 bp)contingent on CGI status and subtracted CAGE cluster regions that overlappedwith extended enhancers (mid position 6200 bp).This created five sets of regions representing non-overlapping bidirectional
enhancers, nonCGI promoters and CGI promoters (annotated and full sets for
with extended enhancers (mid position 6200 bp).This created five sets of regions representing non-overlapping bidirectionalenhancers, nonCGI promoters and CGI promoters (annotated and full sets forthe two latter ones). Motif enrichment was analysed using HOMER36version 3, asuite of tools for motif discovery and next-generation sequencing analysis (http://biowhat.ucsd.edu/homer/). Sequences of the three region sets (enhancers, nonCGIand CGI promoters) were compared to equal numbers of randomly selected geno-mic fragments of the average region size, matched for GC content and auto-normalized to remove bias from lower-order oligo sequences. After maskingrepeats, motif enrichment was calculated using the cumulative binomial distri-bution by considering the total number of target and background sequence regionscontaining at least one instance of the motif. One hundred motifs were searched fora range of motif lengths (7–14 bp) resulting in a set of 800 de novo motifs per set.
After filtering redundant motifs, the top 50 motifs resulting from each search werecombined, remapped and ranked according to enrichment (depletion) in theenhancer set. In parallel, we also used HOMER to calculate the enrichment ofChIP-seq derived known transcription factor motifs. Motif collections includingsearch parameters are deposited in a web database at http://enhancer.binf.ku.dk.Histograms of PhastCons scores were generated using the annotation tool inHOMER.Analysis of splice site and termination signals downstream of CAGE enhancerTSSs and promoter TSSs. To identify motifs downstream of TSSs potentiallydiffering between the structurally related bidirectionally transcribed enhancerTSSs and nonCGI-associated promoter TSSs, we extracted 600 bp regions down-stream of each TSS and performed comparative de novo motif searches usingHOMER. Here, we analysed one set using the other set as background (corrected
for region size, matched for GC content and auto-normalized) to calculate motifenrichment only on the given strand. The top motif enriched downstream ofnCGI promoters was the 5 9-splice site motif. Genomic distributions of the enrichedsplice site motif, as well as the AATAAA termination signal were generated usingHOMER.RNA-seq samples and library preparation. Prior to preparation of sequencinglibraries, rRNA was removed by poly(A)1selection (CD19 1B-cells, CD8 1T-cells, 500 ng) or rRNA depletion (fetal heart, 1 mg). Poly(A)1selection wasdone twice by using Dynabeads Oligo(dT) 25(Life Technologies) according to themanufacturer’s manual. rRNA depletion was done by using Ribo-Zero rRNAremoval kit (Epicentre, Illumina) according to the manual. The treated RNAwas dissolved in 20 ml water.The pretreated RNA was then fragmented by heating at 70 uC for 3.5 min infragmentation buffer (Ambion), followed by immediate chilling on ice and addi-
tion of 1 ml of Stop solution. Fragmented RNA was purified with the RNeasyMinElute kit (Qiagen) following the instructions of the manufacturer except675ml of 100% ethanol is used in step two, instead of 500 ml. Purified RNA wasdephosphorylated in phosphatase buffer (New England Biolabs) with 5 U ofAntarctic phosphatase (New England Biolabs) and 40 U of RNaseOut (LifeTechnologies) at 37 uC for 30 min followed by 5 min at 65 uC. After chilling onice RNA was phosphorylated by addition of the following reagents; 5 mlo f103PNK buffer, 20 U of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs),5ml of 10 mM ATP (Epicentre, Illumina), 40 U of RNaseOut, 17 ml of water.The reaction was incubated at 37 uC for 60 min. Phosphorylated RNA was puri-fied with the RNeasy MinElute kit (Qiagen) as described above. Purified RNA wasconcentrated to 6 ml by vacuum centrifugation on a SpeedVac (Eppendorf).Onemlo f2 mM pre-adenylated 3 9DNA adaptor, 5 9-App/ATCTCGTATGCCGT
CTTCTGCTTG-3 9was added to the concentrated RNA. After incubation at
Onemlo f2 mM pre-adenylated 3 9DNA adaptor, 5 9-App/ATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG-3 9was added to the concentrated RNA. After incubation at70uC for 2 min followed by chilling on ice for 2 min, the following reagents wereadded to ligate the adaptor at the 3 9end of the RNA; 1 mlo f1 03T4 RNA ligase 2truncated buffer, 0.8 ml of 100 mM MgCl 2, 20 U of RNaseOUT and 200 U of RNAligase 2 truncated (New England Biolabs). After the incubation at 20 uC for 60 min,1ml of heat-denatured 5 mM59RNA adaptor, 5 9-GUUCAGAGUUCUACAGUCCGACGAUCGAAA-3 9was ligated with 3 9adaptor ligation products with 20 Uof T4 RNA ligase 1 (New England Biolabs) and 1 ml of 10 mM ATP (New EnglandBiolabs) at 20 uC for 60 min. 4 ml of adaptor ligated RNA was mixed with 1 mlo f20mM RT Primer, 5 9-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGA-3 9, followed by incuba-tion at 70 uC for 2 min, and immediately kept on ice. The reverse transcriptionreaction was done with 2 ml53Prime Script buffer, 1 ml of 10 mM dNTP, 20 U of
RNaseOUT and 200 U of PrimeScript Reverse Transcriptase (TakaraBIO) at 44 uCfor 30 min. The cDNA product was amplified by PCR with 10 mlo f53HF buffer,1.25ml of 10 mM each dNTP mix, 2 mlo f1 0 mM FWD primer, 5 9-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGA-3 9,2ml of RT primerand 1 U of Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs). PCRwas carried out in a total volume of 50 ml with the following thermal program;98uC for 30 s, 12 PCR cycles of 10 s at 98 uC, 30 s at 60 uC, and 15 s at 72 uC,followed by at 72 uC for 5 min and then kept at 4 uC. Remaining PCR primers wereremoved twice by using 1.2 volumes of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Theresulting libraries were checked for size and concentration by BioAnalyzer (Agilent)using the High-Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent). Qualified sequencing libraries wereloaded on the HiSeq2000 (Illumina) using the custom sequencing primer, 5 9-CGACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGACGATCGAAA-3 9.
ACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGACGATCGAAA-3 9.All RNA-seq samples profiled in this study were also profiled in the FANTOM5promoterome manuscript and are described in detail there6. Briefly all humansamples used in the project were either exempted material (available in publiccollections or commercially available), or provided under informed consent. Allnon-exempt material is covered under RIKEN Yokohama Ethics applications(H17-34 and H21-14). For the samples profiled by RNA-seq, the human fetal heartRNA was purchased from Clontech (Catalogue no.636583). CD19 1B-cells andCD81T-cells were isolated using the pluriBead system (huCD4/CD8 cascade andhuCD19 single; PluriSe lect). RNA was then extracted using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen).RNA-seq mapping and transcript assembly. Single-end 100 bp long reads fromlibraries originating from the similar cell sources (all six ‘‘CD19 1B cells’’ librar-ies, all six ‘‘CD8 1T cells’’ libraries and one ‘‘Fetal heart’’ library) were processed
together via the Moirai pipeline (Hasegawa, Y. et al., manuscript in preparation).The processing steps implemented within the Moirai pipeline included (1) rawsequenced reads PolyA tail and ‘‘CTGTAGGCACCATCAAT’’ adaptor clippingusing FASTQ/A Clipper from FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/), (2) removal of sequenced reads containing ‘‘N’’ and sequences similar toARTICLE RESEARCHMacmillan Publishers Limited.

ribosomal RNA using rRNAdust version 1.02 (T.L. et al., manuscript in prepara-tion), and (3) mapping the resulting reads against the hg19 human genome usingTopHat46(version 1.4.1) using both TopHat de novo junction finding mode andknown exon-exon junctions extracted from GENCODE V10, with all the otherparameters set to their default values. Mapped reads flagged as PCR duplicateswere removed and the remaining TopHat aligned reads were then assembled usingCufflinks47(version 1.3.0) with Cufflinks parameters set to their default values.Assessment of lengths of RNAs emanating from enhancers and promoters. AllCufflinks assembled transcripts, whose 5 9ends, regardless of strand, were locatedwithin the outer boundaries of CAGE enhancers or, on the same strand, within200 bp (upstream or downstream) of a GENCODE (v10) protein-coding TSSwere considered for further analysis. For these Cufflinks transcripts we calculated
their (intron-less) RNA length, (possibly intron-containing) genomic length asthe genomic distance between their 5 9and 39ends, as well as their number of exons.Exons of Cufflinks transcripts with 5 9ends in enhancers were further checked forat least 50% (reciprocal) overlap with exons of GENCODE (v10) known, level 1,protein-coding genes and lincRNAs. We repeated the same analysis specifically foru-enhancers.Small RNA library preparation and mapping. Short RNA-seq sequencing lib-raries were prepared as 24-plex using the TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep Kit(Illumina) following the manufacturer’s manual. All starting sources were 1 mgof total RNA. The prepared sequencing libraries were loaded on a HiSeq2000(Illumina). All samples profiled in this study were also profiled in the FANTOM5promoterome paper6and are described in detail there. Briefly, all human samplesused in the project were either exempted material (available in public collections
or commercially available), or provided under informed consent. All non-exemptmaterial is covered under RIKEN Yokohama Ethics applications (H17-34 andH21-14). For the samples profiled by sRNA-seq, the human fetal heart RNA waspurchased from Clontech (catalogue no.636583). CD19 1B-cells and CD8 1T-cellswere isolated using the pluriBead system (huCD4/CD8 cascade and huCD19single; PluriSelect). RNA was then extracted using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen).Short RNAs were profiled using the Truseq protocol from Illumina, using an8-plex. The 8-plex was first split by barcode and the resulting FASTQ sequencestrimmed of the 3 9adaptor sequence. Sequences with low quality base N wereremoved. Ribsomal RNA sequences were then removed using the rRNAdustprogram. Remaining reads were then mapped using BWA version is 0.5.9(r16)and multimappers were randomly assigned.Analysis of small RNAs at enhancer TSSs and promoter TSSs. 59and 39ends of
mapped sRNAs as well as pooled CAGE 5 9ends were overlaid windows of 601 bpcentred on forward strand summits of enhancer-defining CAGE tag clusters andsense strand summits in promoters of RefSeq protein-coding genes. The averagecross-correlation between CAGE 5 9ends and sRNA 3 9ends were calculated inthese windows allowing a max lag of 300. For footprint plots, reads mapping tothe same genomic locations were only counted once not to make any library orgenomic region have an undue influence.HeLa cells culturing and SKIV2L2 depletion. HeLa cells were grown in DMEMmedium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 uC and 5% CO 2.siRNA-mediated knockdown of either EGFP(control), and SKIV2L2 (MTR4)were performed using 22 nM of siRNA and Lipofectamin2000 (Invitrogen) astransfecting agent. A second hit of 22 nM siRNA was given after 48 h. Cells werecollected an additional 48 h after the second hit, and protein depletion was
verified by western blotting analysis as described elsewhere48. The followingsiRNA sequences were used:egfp GACGUAAACGGCCACAAGU[dT][dT]egfp_as ACUUGUGGCCGUUUACGUC[dT][dT]SKIV2L2 CAAUUAAGGCUCUGAGUAA[dT][dT]

CAGE libraries wereprepared from 5 mg of total RNA purified from 2 3106HeLa cells using thePurelink mini kit (Ambion) with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) and on-columnDNase I treatment (Ambion) as recommended by manufacturer. CAGE librarieswere prepared as described previously49. Prior to sequencing four libraries withdifferent barcodes were pooled and applied to the same sequencing lane. Thelibraries were sequenced on a HiSeq2000 instrument (Illumina). To compensatefor the low complexity in 5 9end of the CAGE libraries 30% Phi-X spike-in wereadded to each sequencing lane as recommended by Illumina. CAGE reads wereassigned to their respective originating sample according to identically matching
barcodes. Assigned reads were trimmed to remove linker sequences and subse-quently filtered for a minimum sequencing quality of 30 in 50% of the bases usingthe FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/). Mapping to thehuman genome (hg19) was performed using Bowtie50(version 0.12.7), allowingfor multiple good alignments and subsequently filtering for uniquely mappingreads. Reads thatmapped to unplaced chromosome patches or chrM were discarded.Assessment of degradation rates of RNAs emanating from CAGE enhancersand promoters. Bidirectionally transcribed loci were identified in the same wayas with pooled FANTOM5 CAGE libraries (see ‘Identification of bidirectionallytranscribed loci’ and ‘Expression quantification of bidirectionally transcribed lociand prediction of enhancers’ above) from tag clusters (as defined in51) derivedfrom pooled HeLa CAGE (mock treated control, SKIV2L2 ) libraries. From 5,892
bidirectional loci distant to TSSs and exons, 4,196 were predicted to be enhancersbased on balanced directionality of transcription of which 3,896 had significantlygreater expression than random genomic regions in at least one library. Thesewere then overlapped with the whole set of FANTOM5 CAGE enhancers toestimate the fraction of unseen transcribed enhancers.The expression fold change of HeLa depleted of SKIV2L2 compared to mock-treated control were assessed and compared between expressed HeLa CAGEenhancers, promoters of RefSeq protein-coding genes in general and broken upinto CpG and non-CpG promoters, and ubiquitous FANTOM5 CAGE enhancers.We further calculated the average footprints of H3K4me1, H3K4me2 andH3K27ac from ENCODE (Broad, Bernstein) signal files in 601 bp windowscentred on mid points of enhancers identified in HeLa cells and those that werenovel in SKIV2L22.Purification of blood cell types. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were iso-
lated from leukapheresis products of healthy volunteers by density gradient cent-rifugation over Ficoll/Hypaque (Biochrom AG). Collection of blood cells fromhealthy donors was performed in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. Alldonors signed an informed consent. The leukapheresis procedure and subsequentpurification of peripheral blood cells was approved by the local ethical committee(reference number 92-1782 and 09/066c). CD4 1cells were enriched using mag-netically labelled human CD4 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) and the Midi-MACSsystem (Miltenyi Biotec). The CD4 1fraction was stained with CD4 FITC (fluor-escein isothiocyanate; Becton Dickinson, catalogue no. 345768), CD25 phycoery-thrin (PE; Becton Dickinson, catalogue no. 341011) and CD45RA allophycocyanin(APC) and CD3 1CD41CD252T cells were sorted on a FACS-Aria high-speedcell sorter (BD Biosciences). CD8 1cells were enriched using magnetically labelled
human CD8 MicroBeads (Miltenyi). The CD8 1fraction was stained with CD3FITC (Becton Dickinson, catalogue no 345763) and CD8 APC (Becton Dickinson,
human CD8 MicroBeads (Miltenyi). The CD8 1fraction was stained with CD3FITC (Becton Dickinson, catalogue no 345763) and CD8 APC (Becton Dickinson,catalogue no. 345775) and sorted for CD3 1CD81T cells. CD19 1and CD56 1cells were enriched from the CD8 2fraction using magnetically labelled humanCD19 and CD56 MicroBeads (Miltenyi). Enriched cells were stained with CD3FITC (Becton Dickinson, catalogue no. 345763), CD19 PE (Becton Dickinson,catalogue no. 345777) and CD56 APC (Becton Dickinson, catalogue no. 341027)and sorted into CD3 1CD191B cells and CD3 1CD561natural killer (NK) cells.Purification of blood monocytes is described elsewhere52.Generation of ChIP data for blood cells. Chromatin was obtained fromCD41CD252T cells, CD8 1T cells, CD19 1B cells, and CD56 1NK cells oftwo healthy male donors each. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) forH3K4me1 and H3K27ac and library construction were done essentially as
described elsewhere52. Sequence tags were mapped to the current human ref-erence sequence (GRCh37/hg19) using Bowtie50and only uniquely mapped tagswere used for downstream analyses. H3K4me1 and H3K27ac ChIP-seq data forCD141monocytes was generated elsewhere52. Complementary DNase hyper-sensitivity sequencing data was obtained from the Epigenetics Roadmap project(http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org) and mapped as above. Blood cell ChIP-seq data have been deposited with the NCBI GEO database (accession codeGSE40668) and UCSC Genome Browser track hub data of the entire blood celldata set can be found at http://www.ag-rehli.de/NGSdata.htm. Also see Sup-plementary Table 4.Clustering of blood cell CAGE and epigenetics data. CAGE samples corres-ponding to CD4 1, CD81, B cells, NK cells and monocytes were selected intriplicates from among the set of primary cell samples. Based on the total set of43,011 permissive enhancers, a subset of 6,609 blood-expressed enhancers was
defined as being significantly expressed above genomic background (describedabove) in at least two of the triplicate samples for at least one blood cell type. Thissubset of enhancers was clustered for heat map visualization using completelinkage agglomerative hierarchical clustering based on enhancer usage per celltype (binary matrix) and Manhattan distance.Enhancers were defined as being specifically expressed in one blood cell type ifhaving a pairwise log 2fold change .1.5 with respect to the other four blood celltypes. The fold change was calculated based on the mean expression over trip-licate samples per cell type. Footprints for DNase I hypersensitivity (DHS),H3K4me1 and H3K27ac were calculated per cell-type-specific enhancer set andcell type by extension of reads to 200 bp and overlap aggregation for a window of61 kb around enhancer midpoint as the mean TPM signal over all enhancers inthat specific subset.RESEARCH ARTICLE

Peak-calling was done using MACS253on pooled data for DHS, H3K4me1 andH3K27ac. Per cell type, peaks were regarded as significant if the peak summit fellwithin the upper 1 percentile of the background signal (max values in 92,604random 1 kb non-TSS non-enhancer regions). DHS regions were defined as6500 bp around peak summits. Since ChIP-Seq signals for H3K4me1 andH3K27ac often form bimodal peaks around enhancer sites, peak regions weredefined as merged regions resulting from overlapping 6500 bp regions aroundMACS2 called peak summits.Transient enhancer-reporter assays in blood cells. Selected blood cell-type-specific enhancer regions (ranging from 800–1,200 bp) were PCR-amplified fromhuman genomic DNA and cloned directly into the CpG-free pCpGL-CMV/EF1vector54,55replacing the CMV enhancer with the DMR regions. Primer sequencesare given in Supplementary Table 5. All inserts were verified by sequencing. For
transient transfections, plasmids were isolated and purified using the EndoFreePlasmid Kit (Qiagen). Each luciferase construct was transiently transfected intothree model cell lines (the monocytic THP-1 cell line, the Jurkat T cell line, andthe B cell lymphoma cell line DAUDI). THP-1 and DAUDI cells were transfectedusing DEAE-dextran with 200 ng reporter plasmid and 10 ng Renilla controlvector essentially as described56. Jurkat cells were transfected as described else-where54. The transfected cell lines were cultivated for 48 h, collected, and celllysates were assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity using the DualLuciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) on a Lumat LB9501 (Berthold).Firefly luciferase activity of individual transfections was normalized againstRenilla luciferase activity. Transfections correspond to at least three independentexperiments measured in duplicates.To correct enhancer activity for the amount of read-through that is potentially
generated from the enhancer TSS, we additionally generated constructs lackingthe basal EF1 apromoter for all B cell-specific constructs. Relative luciferaseactivities generated by read-through activity were subtracted from the activityof enhancer/EF1 constructs to reveal ‘true’ enhancer activities of individualregions. To further determine the position and activity of reporter TSS, 5 9rapidamplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR for the luciferase gene was performedas follows: RNA of transfected DAUDI cells was reverse transcribed using theSMARTer RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech) according to the manu-facturers’ instructions. Rapid Amplification of luciferase 5 9cDNA ends (5 9RACE)was performed with the Advantage 2 Polymerase System (Clontech) and a LUCspecific primer (5 9-CATGGCTTCTGCCAGCCTCACAGACATC-3 9) using therecommended touchdown-PCR program. 15 ml of the PCR products were analysed
by agarose gel electrophoresis (2.5%). In addition, fragments were cloned using theStrataClone PCR cloning Kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturers’ instruc-tions and sequenced (Life Technologies).Mass spectrometry analysis of bisulphite-converted DNA. For the set of genomicregions that were also used in transient enhancer-reporter assays, PCR primerswere designed using the MethPrimer web tool57and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (for sequences see Supplementary Table 7). Sodium bisulphite conversionwas performed using the EZ DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research) using 200–1,000 ng of genomic DNA from CD4 1CD252T cells, CD8 1T cells, CD14 1monocytes, CD19 1B cells, and CD56 1NK cells (two donors each) and an alter-native conversion protocol. Amplification of target regions was followed by SAPtreatment, reverse transcription and subsequent RNA base-specific cleavage(MassCLEAVE) as previously described58. Cleavage products were loaded onto
silicon chips (SpectroCHIP) and analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry(MassARRAY Compact MALDI-TOF, Sequenom). Methylation was quantified
silicon chips (SpectroCHIP) and analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry(MassARRAY Compact MALDI-TOF, Sequenom). Methylation was quantifiedfrom mass spectra using the Epityper software (Sequenom), and averaging methy-lation levels of CpG dinucleotides located in the central DNase hypersensitive(nucleosome-free) region that is flanked by CAGE clusters. The methylation datafor individual CpGs are provided in Supplementary Table 8.Definition of expression facets and differentially expressed ‘specific’ facets.Cell and UBERON ontology term mappings were extracted from the FANTOM5sample ontology6for primary cell and tissue samples, respectively, using indirectand direct ‘is_a’ and ‘part_of’ relationships. Ontology terms were manually selectedto construct groups (facets) of samples that were mutually exclusive and to cover asbroad histological and functional annotations as possible. 362 primary cell samples
and 138 tissue and whole blood samples were grouped into 69 cell type facets and41 organ/tissue facets, respectively (the groupings of samples into facets are pro-vided in Supplementary Tables 10 and 11). A few samples were ignored becausethey were difficult to assign to a facet with certainty, which means that the numberof samples within facets is slightly lower than the total number of samples.For each facet, we defined a set of robustly expressed enhancers from the unionof significantly expressed enhancers (see calculation of expression significanceabove) associated with each contained sample.For motif search (see below), we identified the set of robust enhancers that weresignificantly deviating between facets using Kruskal–Wallis rank sum tests(Benjamini–Hochberg FDR ,0.05) and performed pair-wise post-hoc tests(Nemenyi–Damico–Wolfe–Dunn (NDWD) test59,60using the R coin package61to identify enhancers with significant differential expression (Bonferroni single-
step adjusted P,0.05) between facets. Cell type facets and tissue/organ facetswere analysed separately. Each enhancer was considered differentially expressedin a facet with at least one pair-wise significant differential expression and overallpositive standard linear statistics. This procedure means that we, for each robustenhancer, selected the facets, if any, with strong overall differential expressioncompared to all other facets. It should be noted that differential expression in thissense is not equivalent to facet-specific (exclusive) expression.Specificity and usage level analysis. For each robust enhancer, we calculated a‘specificity’ score across cell type and organ/tissue facets. The specificity score wasdefined to range between 0 and 1, where 0 means unspecific (ubiquitously expressedacross facets) and 1 means specific (exclusively expressed in one facet).In detail, specificity( X)51 – (entropy( X)/log 2(N)), where Xis a vector of sample-
average expression values for an enhancer over all facets (cell types and organs/tissues were analysed separately) and Nits cardinality ( jXj, the number of facets).The same calculations were done for TPM and RLE normalized CAGE-derivedexpression levels of RefSeq protein-coding gene promoters (TSS 6500 bp).To visualize the complexity and specialization of facets according to usage andspecificity score of enhancers and genes, we counted the frequency of facet-usedenhancers (significantly expressed in at least one contained sample) and genepromoters ( $1 TPM in at least one sample) with a specificity score in any of 20bins distributed between 0 and 1. The number of robustly expressed enhancersand genes per sample were normalized to enhancers and genes per millionmapped tags, using the total number of mapped CAGE tags in each sample,and further log-transformed. The counts per million mapped tags were visualized
in box plots split by facet (only facets with more than one contained sample wereconsidered).Motif analysis on differentially specific enhancer sets. To identify and compare
in box plots split by facet (only facets with more than one contained sample wereconsidered).Motif analysis on differentially specific enhancer sets. To identify and comparemotif signatures characterizing facet-specific enhancers (permissive set) weapplied de novo motif analyses. Motif enrichment was analysed using HOMER.Enhancer regions (400 bp) were compared to ,50,000 randomly selected geno-mic fragments of the same region size, as described above. Twenty-five motifswere searched for a range of motif lengths (7–14 bp) resulting in a set of 200 denovo motifs per set, which was further filtered to remove redundant motifs. Inparallel, we also used HOMER to calculate the enrichment of ChIP-Seq derivedmotifs. Motif collections including search parameters for all facets are depositedin the web database at http://enhancer.binf.ku.dk. Known transcription factormotifs were used to compare motif enrichment between facets.
Hierarchical clustering of samples. Tissue and primary cell samples mapped toontology facets were clustered by complete linkage agglomerative hierarchicalclustering based on Jensen–Shannon divergence59. In detail, expression values forall enhancers in the permissive set were normalized to sum to 1 for each sampleand the square root (proper distance metric) of all pair wise Jensen–Shannondivergences between samples was calculated. Manually selected clades of sampleswere analysed for differential expression in a similar way as was done for facets(see above). In summary, differentially expressed enhancers (robust set) wereidentified by Kruskal–Wallis rank sum tests (Benjamini–Hochberg FDR ,0.05)and subsequent NDWD post-hoc tests were performed to find all significant pair-wise differences (Bonferroni single-step adjusted P,0.05) between clades.Hierarchical clustering of enhancers. We used matrices describing each enhan-
cer expression in TPMs for each facet (primary cell facets and tissue facets wereclustered independently) and clustered these by complete linkage agglomerativehierarchical clustering using Euclidean distances, as implemented in the gputoolsR package62, and ran these in parallel on a GTX960 Nvidia GPU. Due to limitedmemory in the GPU, we reduced the matrices to enhancers with total expression.2.5 TPM in the primary cell set and .0.6 TPM in the tissue/organ set, resultingin sets of roughly 22.500 enhancers each. To make sure these results were stable,we also explored normalization using fold change versus background in each facetinstead of TPM normalization, which resulted in very similar results (data notshown).We then used the cutree method to select 5 sub-clusters in each tree, startingfrom the root. Enhancers in each set were then extended 6300 nucleotides fromtheir midpoints, and CpG islands and observed/expected CpG ratios were calcu-
lated. The resulting sub-clusters broke up enhancers into 201 and 247 ubiquitousenhancers (u-enhancers) defined by cell type and tissue facets, respectively, (thesesets intersect by 106 enhancers) and non-ubiquitous enhancers. To summarizethe features of u-enhancers in terms of expression width and variance, identifiedin a single plot, we used those enhancers falling into u-enhancer group from thetissue clustering. We then plotted the mean TPM over all tissue facets, as well asthe coefficient of variation (expression variance over all tissue facets scaled byARTICLE RESEARCHMacmillan Publishers Limited.

mean expression). Then we repeated this for the remaining enhancers (non-u-enhancers).Zebrafish reporter transgenesis experiments. We selected enhancers for valid-ation based on human–zebrafish conservation ( .70% sequence identity over 100nucleotides, hg19 vs DanRer7) to take into account the large evolutionary sepa-ration between the two species, and selected enhancers that were only expressedin a subset of tissues/cells. We did not take epigenetic data (ChIP/DHS etc.) intoconsideration. We also selected three negative control regions, chosen randomlyfrom the human genome with the following constraints: low conservation withzebrafish and no other enhancer-selective feature, that is, no DNase hypersensi-tivity, no H3K4me1 or H3K27ac signals and CAGE signal only at noise levels.Selected human enhancers (CRE1-5) were amplified from human genomicDNA using primers (Supplementary Table 9). PCR products were purified using
NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit (Macherey Nagel) and were digested usingappropriate enzymes (listed in Supplementary Table 9). Human enhancers werecloned into EcoRV/SpeI or HindIII/EcoRI sites of pDB896 vector (gift fromD. Balciunas) upstream of zebrafish gata2 promoter63,64andYFP reporter gene.Plasmid DNA was purified using NucleoBond Xtra Midi Kit (Macherey Nagel)and quality checked by sequencing before injections.Zebrafish stocks ( Danio rerio ) were kept and used according to Home Officeregulations (UK) at the University of Birmingham. For these experiments wild-type fish (AB *strain) were used. Adults were crossed pairwise and eggs werecollected 10-15 min after fertilization. Microinjection solutions contained 30 ngml21of plasmid DNA, 0,2% of phenol red (Sigma) and 15 ng ml21of Tol2 mRNAtranscribed in vitro from pCS2:Tol2 plasmid using mMESSAGE machine SP6 Kit(Ambion). Injections were performed through the chorion and into the cyto-
plasm of zygotes using an analogue pressure-controlled microinjector (TritechResearch). More than 200 eggs were injected per construct and experiments werereplicated at least three times. Embryos were kept according to ref. 65 in E3Medium containing 50 ng ml21of gentamicin (Fisher Scientific) and 0.03% phe-nylthiourea (PTU, Sigma) in an incubator at 28.5 uC.Injected embryos were screened during the first 5 days post-fertilization usinga Nikon SMZ1500 fluorescence stereomicroscope. Specific expression patternswere documented at 48 hpf and levels of expression were quantified by countingthe number of embryos showing enhancer-specific expression. To control foroverall background activity from the construct (that is, promoter, backbone) anempty pDB896 vector containing gata2 zebrafish promoter linked to the reportergene but lacking an enhancer sequence was used. Any tissue-specific enrichmentshown by enhancer-containing vectors over the activity shown by the empty
control vector was considered enhancer-specific. Additionally, three negativeregions were also cloned to check the specificity of the enhancer selection process.These regions were chosen randomly from the human genome to have lowconservation with zebrafish and no other enhancer-selective feature, that is, noDNase I hypersensitivity, no H3K4me1 or H3K27ac signals and CAGE signalonly at noise levels. In parallel, 5 selected human enhancers were also analysed.See Supplementary Table 9 for a summary of zebrafish validations, includingexpression patterns, signal strengths and primers.Analysis of cohesin data. We used MCF7 cell ChIP experiments with antibodiestargeting STAG1 and RAD21 proteins, downloaded from the Short Read archive(accession nos ERR011980, ERR011982). These were mapped using Bowtie50with standard settings but discarding non-unique hits, and peak-called usingMACS53with default settings. We then used the intersection between peak sets
as proxy binding sites for the cohesin complex.Linking TSSs and enhancers by expression correlations. We identified all intra-
as proxy binding sites for the cohesin complex.Linking TSSs and enhancers by expression correlations. We identified all intra-chromosomal enhancer-promoter pairs (470,315 cases, permissive set of enhan-cers and unique locations of RefSeq protein-coding gene transcript TSSs 6500 bp)within 500 kb, in which the TSS was expressed .1 TPM in at least one sample, andperformed Pearson correlation tests between the expression of such pairs: 64% ofenhancers had at least one significant a ssociation (Benjamini–Hochberg FDR #1025)within that distance. On average, a TSS was associated with 4.9 enhancers and anenhancer with 2.4 TSSs.Next, we identified which predicted associations were supported by ENCODEChIA-PET (via RNAPII (MMS-126R)) interaction data21from four ENCODEcell lines (HCT-116, HeLa-S3, K562, MCF-7) by requiring an overlap of bothenhancer and promoter in both (and different) sites of a ChIA-PET interaction
pair. An association was considered supported if it overlapped in this way withany cell line replicate of interactions.For comparison, the fraction of 1,672,958 published10predicted enhancer-promoter associations derived from DNase data supported by ENCODE ChIA-PET interaction data was calculated.Analysis of genomic clusters of densely positioned enhancers. By pairwisedistance calculations between CAGE enhancers, we identified clusters of denselypositioned enhancers (mid points separated by ,2 kb) in the genome. 815 regionsof length $2 kb containing .2 enhancers were identified. Of these, 198 regionscontained enhancers whose average pairwise expression correlation (Pearson’s r)were$0.75. The expression of associated Refseq genes (see ‘Linking TSSs andenhancers by expression correlations’) as well as their enrichment of gene onto-logy biological process terms (via the DAVID tool66) were compared to that ofgenes associated with non-clustered enhancers.
genes associated with non-clustered enhancers.Inferring regulatory architectures by multiple linear regression. Multiple lin-ear regression was performed for all 25,144 expressed (max TPM .1) RefSeqTSSs with at least ten FANTOM5 CAGE-defined enhancers within 500 kb. Enhancerswere ranked by proximity to the TSS and the expression values across all samples ofthe ten closest were used as predictor variables in a model with the TSS expressionas response variable. The expression data of enhancers and TSSs were centred andrescaled. 2,206 TSS models, considering in total 11,386 enhancers, with R2$0.5were considered for further analyses. We also fitted a simple linear regressionmodel using each enhancer as predictor variable on their own, in order to comparethe predictive power of a single enhancer to the power of using all ten. We defined anew measure of ‘proportional contribution’ to the variance explained as the ratio
between simple linear regression r2and multiple linear regression R2, for eachenhancer among the ten considered for each TSS. This measure yielded highlysimilar ranking results of enhancers as the R2contribution averaged over orderingsamong regressors67,68andR2decorrelation decomposition67,69(data not shown),implemented in the ‘relaimpo’ R package37,69(lmg and car methods, respectively).We used ranking of enhancers according to proportional contribution and within-model enhancer-enhancer correlations to identify TSSs with different enhancerarchitectures. Redundant enhancers were identified for TSSs that had enhancersthat were, by proportional contribution, ranked second and onwards with at leastsome proportional contribution ( .0.2) and high correlation (Pearson’s r.0.7)with any other of the nine enhancers in the model. Patterning architectures wereconsidered for enhancers in non-redundant models that were, by proportional
contribution, ranked second and onwards with at least some proportional contri-bution ( .0.2) and low correlation (Pearson’s r,0.3) with all other of the nineenhancers in the model.
contribution, ranked second and onwards with at least some proportional contri-bution ( .0.2) and low correlation (Pearson’s r,0.3) with all other of the nineenhancers in the model.Penalized lasso-based regression was used to reduce the number of enhancersin the models. The optimal models were selected using 100-fold cross validationand the largest value of lambda such that the mean squared error was within onestandard error of the minimum, using the R package glmnet29,37SNP analysis. The NIH NHGRI catalogue of published genome-wide associationstudies29(GWAS catalogue, downloaded 7 May 2012) contained 7,899 SNP-disease/trait associations. We extended this set to 190,356 autosomal associationsby propagating disease/trait associations to proxy SNPs using the SNAP proxysearch tool70(http://www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/snap/) based on linkage dis-equilibrium ( r2.0.8) between SNPs (within 250 kb) in any of the three popula-
tions in the 1000 genomes project pilot71data. The 1000 Genome data coordinateswere in hg18 coordinates and were mapped to hg19 using the UCSC liftOver tool72.For robust enhancers (centre 6200 bp), promoters (unique locations of RefSeqprotein-coding gene transcript TSSs 6200 bp), exons (unique locations of RefSeqprotein-coding gene transcript inner exons), and random regions (describedabove), we calculated the number of overlapping and non-overlapping GWASSNPs associated with each disease/trait in the extended GWAS catalogue. Non-associated SNPs were extracted from the NCBI single nucleotide polymorphismdatabase (dbSNP, build 135). For each genomic feature and disease/trait with anodds ratio .1, we tested whether the observed overlap was significantly greaterthan expected (Fisher’s exact test P,0.01). Only diseases/traits with more thanthree SNPs overlapping were tested. The same analysis was repeated for each set of
significantly expressed enhancers associated with each facet. For ease of visualiza-tion and interpretation, only odds ratios for which the filtering criteria on both sig-nificance and overlap number were met are shown. Lists of enhancer-overlappedGWAS SNPs are in S16.Statistical tests, visualization and tools used. Statistical tests were done in the Renvironment (http://www.R-project.org). Graphs were made using lattice, ggplot2and gplots R packages. Cluster trees were generated by the APE73R package andvisualized using the FigTree software (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).Intersections of and distances between various genomic features were calculatedusing BEDTools74.39.
