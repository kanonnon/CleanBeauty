IntroductIon© 2009 The Society for Investigative Dermatology www.jidonline.org 1This volume is composed of the papers presented at the Photo-aging Research Symposium held as a satellite meet-ing of IID 2008 conjoined with the 9th annual meeting of the Society of Japanese Photo-Aging Research in Kyoto, Japan on May 13, 2008.The purpose of the symposium was to provide a forum for profound and fruitful discussion on photo-aging of skin, particularly focusing on the mechanisms of sun-induced wrinkle formation and pigmentary changes. The Society aimed not only to review novel findings on mechanisms and treatments in order to update our understanding of human skin photo-aging, but also to freely discuss contro-versial observations and theories in this field.The goal of this publication is to provide an overview
of “Photo-aging 2008,” and to encourage and stimulate researchers to design and conduct future studies to clarify the mechanisms of photo-aging caused by solar light. It is hoped that this will lead to even better strategies for pre-vention and repair of sun-induced damage.The symposium could not have been possible or suc-cessful without the participation of the leading researchers in photo-aging worldwide. We very much appreciate their contributions and enthusiasm for the field.Finally, the organizers of the symposium wish to acknowledge the support of Prof. Shinji Shimada, the presi-dent of the Japanese Society of Investigative Dermatology and the host of IID 2008 in Kyoto for providing the oppor -tunity to hold this symposium as an IID 2008 satellite meet-ing. The organizers also wish to acknowledge the Clinique Laboratories for their generous support of this symposium and publication of this supplement issue.Masamitsu Ichihashi (President),Akimichi Morita (Vice President),
