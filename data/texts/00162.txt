However,major drawbacks associated with most of them include issues with sustainability,safety, biocompatibility, biorecognition, stability, bi oavailability, bioadhesion, generationof reactive species, inefﬁcient encapsulation and protect ion, and inability to releasethe bioactive compounds at target regions of the gastrointe stinal tract. The use ofvesicles innately formed in plant and animal cells as delive ry agents would potentially
solve most problems associated with the existing nanodeliv ery systems. Underutilizedvesicles, known as exosomes, exist in plant and animal cells , where they play rolesin cell communication and nutrient delivery. To date, exoso mes have proven to bestable, biocompatible and able to withstand the activity of digestive enzymes untilthey reach their target locations. However, there is a need t o explore better ways ofinducingexosomeproduction,toelucidatetheirphysiolog icalroles,andunderstandtheirbiogenesis in plants, to discover sustainable methods of is olation of high yields of thevesicles. There is also a need to clarify the digestibility a nd interaction of the exosomeswith blood and gastrointestinal ﬂuids. This review highlig hts the isolation techniques anddelivery potential of exosomes, and equally presents resea rch gaps for enhancing theuse of the natural vesicles for delivery purposes.
Keywords: exosomes, extracellular vesicles, differential u ltracentrifugation, immunoisolation, exosome-likevesicles, loading efﬁciency, biostability, nutraceutica l compoundsINTRODUCTIONDuring the past decade, there has been a pressing need for devel oping green, sustainable andbiocompatible materials for the delivery of bioactive compoun ds within the food, pharmaceuticaland medical industry. Extracellular vesicles, derived from pl ants and animals are considerablyimportant in this area. Among the various extracellular vesic les, exosome, an intraluminal vesiclereleased when multivesicular bodies undergo exocytosis, ha ve gained attention as a potentialnanodelivery system for nutraceutical compounds. This is be cause of their various desirableproperties such as small size, safety, biocompatibility, bior ecognition, high stability and targetspeciﬁcity. Other extracellular vesicles such as microvesicl es diﬀer from exosomes in their
biogenesis and size. Exosomes have a size range of 30–100nm ( Raposo and Stoorvogel, 2013 )compared to sizes of 100–1,000nm reported for most microvesic les that are derived mainly

For several years, the role of exosomes in normalphysiological function was unknown. They were assumed tobe waste products obtained from the shedding of plasmamembranes.Furtherresearchhasnowproposedtheparticipationofexosomesinvarioushumanphysiologicalfunctions.Assho wninFigure1, exosome vesicles are composed of proteins, lipidsandnuclearcomponentsthataccumulaterandomlyfromthecel lin which they originate. Because of the way they are formed,
their phospholipid bilayer exterior is made up of cell surfaceproteins, which allow them to take part in processes such asintercellular communication, exchange of materials with o thercells, elimination of unwanted products from cells, and immu nesurveillance( Andaloussietal.,2013;Beachetal.,2014 ).Whetherit is by phagocytosis, endocytosis or activating another cel lthrough the surface proteins, exosomes have been proven to befunctionalincommunicationanddeliveryinbiologicalsyst ems.In animals, exosomes are secreted mainly by immune cellssuch as tumor cells, red blood cells, platelets, lymphocytes, anddendritic cells ( Mandal, 2016 ). They are present in biologicalﬂuids such as milk, urine and blood plasma ( Keller et al., 2007 ).More recently, there are reports of the presence of plant vesiclesthat resemble exosomes in structure and function, but theirbiogenesisisstillnotclear.Severalmethodshavebeenest ablished
for isolating exosomes and exosome-like vesicles from anima land plant sources, with diﬀerential ultracentrifugation as t hemajor technique. Once isolated, exosomes can further be loa dedwiththedesiredbioactivecompounds.Eventhoughexosomeshaveprospectsforuseindrugdeliveryapplications, there are many knowledge gaps to fully utilizetheir competitive properties. For instance, what happens to theexosomes in the body during and after delivery of bioactivecompounds?Arehumancellsandorganscomfortableinteractin gwith foreign exosomes from plants the way they do with humanexosomes? Moreover, the process of oﬄoading the content ofexosome to achieve high loading eﬃciency is not clear, andthe distinctive behavior and contents of exosomes derived f romplant and animal sources need to be established. There isalso a need to sustainably produce and isolate high yields ofexosome vesicles from plants for practical use in the delivery ofbioactivecompounds.ISOLATION OF EXOSOMES
bioactivecompounds.ISOLATION OF EXOSOMESIsolation by Differential UltracentrifugationThis method has become the gold standard procedure forisolationandpuriﬁcationofexosomesandexosome-likeparti clesmainly because of its simplicity and cost-eﬀectiveness ( Li et al.,2017). The method relies on diﬀerences in density and sizeof the separated particles. The exosome source, biological ﬂu idor plant juice, is subjected to series of centrifugation proce sseswith increasing speeds and duration to eliminate the larger a ndhigher-densitycomponents;thepelletsderivedfromthisstep arediscarded. The ﬁnal round of centrifugation of the supernata ntis done at a higher speed of about 100,000 ×g to recoverthe pellet containing the exosomes, which is then resuspendedand washed in a buﬀer. This method is often modiﬁed for thediﬀerent sources of exosomes. For instance, for animal ﬂuids(e.g.,plasma),becauseoftheirviscosity,dilutionoftheﬂu idand
centrifugation at increased speed and duration are necessar y forobtaining high exosome yields ( Théry et al., 2006 ). Diﬀerentialultracentrifugation is the basic procedure for exosome isol ation
centrifugation at increased speed and duration are necessar y forobtaining high exosome yields ( Théry et al., 2006 ). Diﬀerentialultracentrifugation is the basic procedure for exosome isol ationand the resulting exosomes often contain contaminants, mai nlynucleic acids and protein aggregates ( Chiou and Ansel, 2016 ).For further puriﬁcation, an extra step could be added involvin g30% sucrose gradient. Exosomes ﬂoat on a sucrose gradient(Figure2); hence, this step is invaluable for obtaining purerexosomes.Thisprocessensuresthatmajorityofthecontamin antsisolated with the exosomes do not ﬂoat with the exosomes and,thus, would be separated. Munagala et al. (2016) demonstratedthatdiscardingthepelletsderivedfromcentrifugationat1 00,000×g and adding an extra centrifugation at 135,000 ×gsuccessfullyeliminatedothercontaminatingextracellular vesicles(Arntz et al., 2015 ). Although this process increases purity, ithoweverreducestheyieldoftheisolatedexosomes.
howeverreducestheyieldoftheisolatedexosomes.Isolation by UltraﬁltrationDue to the low purity of exosomes isolated by diﬀerentialultracentrifugation, eﬀorts have been made to devise method sforlarge-scaleisolationofexosomeswithbothhigherpurit yandyield. Ultraﬁltration is a technique that separates biomolecul esbased on size diﬀerence. Lobb et al. (2015) suggested thismethod as a faster alternative to ultracentrifugation whenthey observed that it led to a higher recovery of exosomeparticles. Ultraﬁltration involves the use of membrane ﬁltersand pressure to eliminate large molecular size contaminantswith subsequent isolation of exosomes. Despite the promise,the applied pressure in this process may lead to contamination,Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems | www.frontiersin.o rg 2 April 2019 | Volume 3 | Article 23

Food Bioactives Delivery With ExosomesFIGURE 2 | Sources, isolation and puriﬁcation of exosomes and exosome- like vesicles.as larger vesicles may disintegrate into vesicles that resem bleexosomes and be co-isolated with the exosomes ( Li et al., 2017 ).An emerging modiﬁcation to this approach involves separationof the ultraﬁltration product by liquid chromatography forfurther puriﬁcation ( Andaloussi et al., 2013 ). This extra step isexpected to increase the production cost, which is an importantconsiderationwhenusingexosomesinfoodapplications.Isolation by ImmunoisolationIn this method, magnetic beads are coated with antibodies th attarget the proteins present on the exosome surface ( Théry et al.,2006).Thismethodreliesonsurfacebiomarkersthatareuniquelyexpressed on exosomes ( Li et al., 2017 ). Although it ensuresisolation with high purity, the major drawback of this approachis the limited information available on exosomal structure s and
surface compositions, especially for new plant sources. Besid es,the process would not be eﬃcient for large-scale isolation ofexosomes due to the dissociation and puriﬁcation steps requir edaftertheirbindingtotheantibodies.STABILITY OF EXOSOMESExosomes have proven to increase the stability of its contentand, hence, can play a role in enhancing bioavailability ofbioactive compounds. Some studies have shown that exosomescanresisttheenzymesindigestiveandotherbiologicalﬂuid s,sotheir contents are protected from degradation until they rea chtheir target. For instance, curcumin encapsulated in exosome sderived from EL-4 cells was found to be about four timesmore stable, with higher water solubility, when compared tofree curcumin ( Mandal, 2016 ). Among the extracellular vesicles,namely ectosomes, exosomes and apoptotic bodies, exosomeshave proven to be most stable. Osteikoetxea et al. (2015) foundthat exosomes possess a liquid-ordered phase membrane and
demonstrate the least sensitivity to detergent lysis of the threevesicletypes.Stability of Animal-Derived ExosomesExosomes are in their optimal state when freshly isolated butcan be stored for up to 1 year at −80◦C with no coagulation(Théry et al., 2006; Munagala et al., 2016 ). However, repeatedfreeze-thaw cycles aﬀect the structural integrity and shelflife of exosomes. Biological ﬂuids (e.g., plasma) containin gexosomes can be stored for up to 5 days at 4◦C in a glassbottle (Théry et al., 2006 ). Stability for up to 3 months at−20◦C has also been reported ( Kalra et al., 2013 ). A study byKumeda et al. (2017) revealed that the integrity of exosomesisolated from human saliva was retained for up to 20 monthswhen stored at 4◦C, and 28 days when stored at 4◦C inwhole saliva containing various enzymes. Although animalcell-derived exosomes are stable at low temperatures, theirstructural and physicochemical properties could be aﬀected by
pressure, repeated freeze-thaw cycles, nature of solvent, an dstorage duration. Understanding the relationship between t hesefactors and the integrity of exosomes is essential for eﬃcie ntapplication of the vesicles in enhancing the bioavailability o fbioactivecompounds.Stability of Plant-Derived Exosome-LikeVesiclesPlant-derived edible vesicles respond diﬀerently in biologi cal(e.g., stomach-like and intestinal) conditions. Changes i n thesize and surface charge of exosomes depend on the plant sourceand environment ( Mu et al., 2014 ). For instance, exosomeproperties may be pH-dependent. Grape-derived exosome-likevesicleswerereducedinsizeinstomachandintestinalcondi tions,compared to vesicles suspended in water, while a portion ofthe vesicles derived from ginger were enlarged in stomach-like and intestine-like environments ( Mu et al., 2014 ). Sincedynamic light scattering was used in the analysis, it is diﬃcu lt

dynamic light scattering was used in the analysis, it is diﬃcu ltto conclude if the size diﬀerences were due to aggregationof the vesicles, increase in the size of individual particles, orﬂuid absorption under these biological conditions. This ﬁnd ingis contrary to the work of Mandal (2016) , where exosomesisolated from EL-4 (murine lymphoblast) cells were stable whe ntreated with digestive enzymes. In our opinion, the surface a ndcompositional diﬀerences underscores the need to further stu dythe stability of exosomes from diﬀerent sources in food andbiologicalmatrices.Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems | www.frontiersin.o rg 3 April 2019 | Volume 3 | Article 23
Akuma et al. Food Bioactives Delivery With ExosomesLOADING EFFICIENCY OF EXOSOMESExosomes already contain some compounds encapsulatednaturally in the vesicles. To maximize the loading eﬃciency ,there may be a need to oﬄoad the content of the exosomes andexosome-likeparticles.Todate,noinformationisavailabl eintheliteratureontheoﬄoadingofexosomes.Thisstepcouldenha ncethe use of exosomes in delivery if the membrane integrity is n otlost during the oﬄoading process. Plant exosome-like particl espossess more bioactive compounds than those derived fromanimals, but in scenarios where the bioactive compound is notthe one of interest, an oﬄoading step may be added. Regardingthe loading process, two major methods have been applied:passiveandactivecargoloading.Passive Cargo LoadingPassive cargo loading involves an incubation process thatrecruit bioactive compounds into the exosomes. It consists o ftwo major methods. The ﬁrst method involves incubation of
compounds with the exosomes ( Luan et al., 2017 ). This methodof encapsulation and its loading eﬃciency rely on the processof diﬀusion and hydrophobic interaction between the lipid laye rof the exosomes and the molecule to be loaded ( Luan et al.,2017).Vashisht et al. (2017) reported the loading eﬃciency ofcurcumin in exosomes using this loading method to be 70.46%.Curcumin was also loaded into exosomes derived from EL-4cells with a loading capacity of 2.9g curcumin per 1g exosomes.However, a major drawback of this method is that it dependson diﬀusion through a concentration gradient for loading. Th esecondmethodislesscommonandinvolvesincubationwithth edonor cells. The purpose of this approach is for the host cellsto accumulate the bioactive compound and secrete exosomesthat possess these compounds ( Luan et al., 2017 ). Due to theuntargetednature,thismethodmayleadtolowyieldofexoso mescontainingthecompoundsofinterest.Active Cargo Loading
Active Cargo LoadingActive cargo loading involves methods that disrupt themembrane of the exosomes temporarily so that the desiredcompounds could easily diﬀuse into the vesicles. Membraneintegrity is then restored after the bioactive compoundsare loaded into the exosomes. The membrane could bedisrupted by sonication, extrusion, and freeze-thaw cycles .This method of cargo loading was reported to increasethe loading capacity of extracellular vesicles by up to 11times when compared to passive cargo loading ( Fuhrmannet al., 2015 ). The problem associated with this methodis the potential of damaging the native structures andtargeting features of exosomes during the membrane disrupti onprocess. We suggest that a combination of passive andactive cargo loading may solve the problems associated witheachmethod.DELIVERY APPLICATION OF EXOSOMESExosomesgainedalotofinterestoverthepastdecadebecause of
theirpotentialasananodeliverysystem( Table1),andadvantagesover other delivery systems. For instance, exosome vesicles forminnately and naturally participate as nanocarriers. Thus, un likesome synthetic liposomes used in delivery, exosomes would beexpected to be more biocompatible and safer. Exosomes arefound in various biological ﬂuids such as milk (Figure2) andare generally considered stable in digestive and other biolo gicalﬂuids.Thus,exosomescanbeeﬃcientinlongdistancebiologi calcommunication ( Luan et al., 2017 ), as they would not bedestroyed by the digestive condition and would likely remainunchangeduntiltheyreachtheirdestination.Exosomesalso havea targetability advantage as they bind speciﬁc targets due totheiruniquesurfacecompositions.Onreachingtheirdestina tion,exosomes can oﬄoad their contents into the target cells throu gheither phagocytosis or membrane fusion (Figure3) (Aryani andDenecke, 2016 ).

Although exosomes generally have a naturaltargeting capability, which diﬀers depending on their source,their preferred target can be customized by inserting molecul esindonorcells(sources)thatwouldberecognizedbytherecipi entcells in the body ( Luan et al., 2017 ). This process includesinserting genes that code for proteins that target speciﬁc cell s,so that exosomes secreted from those cells possess the desiredtargetingcapability.Mammalian Exosomes as a DeliveryVehicle for Nutraceutical CompoundsIn designing a drug delivery system for Parkinson’s disease,Haney et al. (2015) reported the eﬃcient encapsulation andstabilization of catalase with exosomes isolated from muri nemonocytes and macrophages. A size range of 100–200nmwas obtained for the catalase-loaded exosomes, which had ahigh loading eﬃciency, sustained release, its content prese rvedfrom degradation by proteases, and signiﬁcant in vitro and
in vivoneuroprotective properties. Moreover, fetal calf serumexosome has proven to be a good vehicle for deliveringshort interfering (si)RNA into the mouse brain ( Alvarez-Ervitiet al., 2011 ). Exosomes isolated from murine lymphoma andmacrophage cell lines have also been employed in curcuminencapsulation and delivery ( Sun et al., 2010; Zhuang et al.,2011). In one study, exosome encapsulation enhanced thebioavailability and anti-inﬂammatory activity of curcumi n andensured target speciﬁcity toward inﬂammatory cells ( Sun et al.,2010). In the other, curcumin or a signal transducer andactivator of transcription 3 (stat3) inhibitor encapsulated inexosomes and delivered intranasally protected mice from LPS-induced inﬂammation, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoproteinpeptide-induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis progression,and inhibited murine brain tumor (GL26) cell growth ( Zhuanget al., 2011 ). The attention given to animal-derived exosomes
as delivery vehicles for bioactive compounds is because of the irbiocompatibility, biorecognition, target speciﬁcity, and s tability(Kelleretal.,2006 ).Delivery of Bioactive Plants ComponentsExosome-like particles derived from plants have recently gai neda lot of interest.

The exosome vesicles also have factors that deter minetheir delivery eﬃciency, such as long-distance communicat ionfactors. Majority of the plant sources have inherent and uniq uecompoundswithphysiologicallyrelevantbioactivities.Iti slikelythat the bioactive compounds are also delivered to their targ etsviaexosome-like vesicles. Zhang et al. (2016a) reported thatginger-derived exosomes possess high levels of phosphatidicacid, which promotes intervesicular fusion. Furthermore, Rutterand Innes (2017) reported the presence of exosomes in theapoplastsofleaves,anditsroleinplantimmunitywasconﬁrmedbased on their protein proﬁle and high expression duringstress. For target delivery, there would be a need to oﬄoadthe inherent bioactive compounds in exosomes in order to
achieve a high loading eﬃciency with the bioactive compoundsofinterest.Plant Lipid-Derived Vesicles as DeliveryVehiclesNanovectors can also be made from lipids extracted fromplant sources and used as nanocarriers of bioactive compoundsother than their inherent compounds. Using sonication,lipids extracted from plants can form nanostructures ontowhich small compounds can be embedded. For instance,doxorubicin was successfully inserted into nanovesicles de rivedfrom ginger lipids through electrostatic interaction and th isencapsulation prompted the drug release in a pH-dependentmanner ( Zhang et al., 2016b ). This stands as a good large-scale method for nanodelivery, and overcomes the low yieldissue associated with exosomes. However, the lipid nanocarr iersare not exosomes, in structure and function, but they havethe beneﬁts of a natural, food-derived delivery system. Alimitation of this system is the exclusive dependence on
electrostatic interaction for the loading and oﬄoading ofthevesicles.Exosomes and LiposomesUnlike exosomes, which are produced naturally, liposomesare made synthetically and have a similar lipid bilayerstructure. Liposomes are designed to enable both encapsulatio nof hydrophilic molecules such as siRNA, DNA, and RNA,into the aqueous core of the vesicle, and hydrophobicbioactive compounds such as proteins, peptides, phenolicsand antibodies, into the lipid bilayer ( Ça˘gda¸ s et al., 2014 ).Liposomes are prepared by membrane extrusion, sonication,microemulsiﬁcation, and freeze-thawing, and have been uti lizedin many drug delivery applications, e.g., in the formulation o famphotericin B, doxorubicin, verteporﬁn, cytarabine, morphi nesulfate, and daunorubicin ( Fan and Zhang, 2013 ). Preparationof liposomes, however, can be problematic as it requiresnumerous chemical treatments and steps to modify thelipid bilayer structure using protein, ligands, and antibodi es
(Ishida et al., 1999; Theek et al., 2016 ). The diﬃcultyin functionalizing the lipid bilayer and rigorous syntheticprotocol can be circumvented by the use of exosome fordelivery purposes. Exosomes and liposomes have similarphysicochemical properties but unlike liposomes, exosomescannot be currently used to eﬀectively deliver exogenoushydrophilic macromolecules ( Stremersch et al., 2016 ). Theinherent biochemical similarities between the exosome sur faceand that of the originating cells makes it more feasible, whencompared to liposomes, to target cells from which the exosomesarederived( Kelleretal.,2006 ).Challenges With the Use of Exosomes forDelivery PurposesThe major drawback with the use of exosomes as a deliveryagent is centered on ineﬃcient extraction and isolationprocess, low extraction yield, low encapsulation and loadingeﬃciencies, and issues with delivery of exogenous hydrophil icmacromolecules, and potential delivery of unwanted cargo
materials naturally present in the exosomes. Most exosomeextraction methods are complex, labor intensive, and give lo w
macromolecules, and potential delivery of unwanted cargomaterials naturally present in the exosomes. Most exosomeextraction methods are complex, labor intensive, and give lo wyield. However, recent extraction and detection technique shave shown promise, such as magnetic adhesion ( Qi et al.,2016) and ﬂow cytometry ( Morales-Kastresana et al., 2017 )in addition to improved loading technique such as sonication(Kim et al., 2016 ), electroporation ( Kamerkar et al., 2017 ),and incubation ( Qi et al., 2016 ). However, oﬄoading thecontent of exosome without distorting the structural integr ityis very important in ensuring high loading and encapsulationeﬃciencies. Lastly, there is a need for exosome functionaliz ationto accommodate the encapsulation of exogenous hydrophilicmacromolecules either by pre-formation (i.e., during exosom ebiogenesis) or post-formation loading (i.e., after exosomeisolation)( Stremerschetal.,2016 ).CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONSSince exosomes have piqued curiosity, there has beenan increasing focus on their potential application in thedelivery of bioactive food compounds. As some nutrients andphytochemicals can pass through the digestive tract withoutbeing absorbed eﬃciently, exosomes can be explored as a stabl eand natural nanodelivery system for increasing bioavailab ilityof these compounds. Moreover, it is likely that these vesiclesalready function as nanocarriers within the plant and animaltissues. For instance, when fruits are consumed, there is thepossibility that exosome-like particles are used as nanovecto rsin the body, thereby functioning in delivering of their inhe rentnutrients and bioactive compounds. Some studies have focuse don the loading of exosomes with bioactive compounds toachieve a high loading eﬃciency. We recommend the additionof an extra step to the standard procedure where the vesicles
are stripped of their initial contents prior to the loading step.The oﬄoading process should be such that the content isremoved without signiﬁcantly altering the native structur e(e.g., size, surface composition) and biological function ( e.g.,long-distance communication) of exosomes.
