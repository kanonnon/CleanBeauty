appearance of aging. Most of these patients also use topical creams in addition to undergoing surgical procedures. Over-the-counter (OTC) anti-aging products are a billion-dollar industry to which even young patients who wish to prevent the agingprocess contribute.Many OTC products advertise dramatic results, but there have been relatively little scientiﬁc data to support these claims. Wereviewed the literature on ingredients commonly found in OTC anti-aging creams. We conclude that although many different com-pounds are marketed as anti-aging products, studies proving their efﬁcacy are limited. Vitamin C and alpha-hydroxy acids havebeen the most extensively researched products, and their anti-aging capabilities have been demonstrated in the literature. Therehave also been some promising studies on vitamin A and vitamin B derivatives. Moisturizers have been shown to increase skinhydration and improve the overall appearance of skin. Studies also indicate that pentapeptides can be
Studies also indicate that pentapeptides can be effective in decreasing facialwrinkles and roughness. However, botanicals, which have become popular over the last few years, require signiﬁcantly moreresearch to formulate any positive conclusions for their topical application. As aesthetic surgeons, it behooves us to educate our-selves on the most common ingredients found in topical anti-aging products and their efﬁcacy.

Thereare two processes that lead to aging: the intrinsicchronologic aging of the skin, which is largely genetic,and environmentally induced aging.1Environmentalexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, smoking, wind,and chemical exposure result in roughness, fine lines,sagging, irregular pigmentation, and decreased skin elas-ticity.1Cumulative exposure to UV irradiation is one of

Aesthetic Surgery Journal ~ July/August 2007 403 The Truth About Over-the-Counter Topical Anti-Aging Products: A Comprehensive ReviewSCIENTIFIC FORUMMany of these alterations in the extracellular matrix aremediated by matrix metalloproteinases that degrade ﬁb-rillar collagen (type I and III).2,3However, the primarymechanism by which UV irradiation damages skin cellsis by the photochemical generation of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS)—superoxide anion, peroxide, and singletoxygen—that damage nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins,including collagen.3,4This cumulative collagen damagedisrupts the structural integrity of skin and contributesto wrinkle formation.The skin protects itself with naturally occurringantioxidants, such as vitamins A, C, and E, squalene, andcoenzyme Q-10, which donate electrons and neutralizethe ROS.5,6These natural antioxidants become depletedwith age and UV exposure.7UV radiation also forms
with age and UV exposure.7UV radiation also formsthymine dimers—an inappropriate bond between twothymine bases in the DNA. These nucleic acid errors areexcised and repaired, but if cumulative damage allows forthe replication of a dimer, carcinogenesis results.In 2000, according to Time magazine, Americansspent more than $2 billion on OTC anti-aging prod-ucts.8,9Many OTC products boast dramatic results usingvarious combinations of ingredients to produce thedesired youthful effects. To participate in a patient’squest for slowing down the visible signs of aging, itbehooves the plastic surgeon to educate him- or herselfabout the most common ingredients found in OTC cos-metics and their efﬁcacy.VitaminsVitamin A/retinolsVitamin A is a naturally occurring antioxidant in the
skin. The biologically active form of vitamin A is all-transretinoic acid or tretinoin (Retin-A). Retinoic acid aids inepidermal proliferation, keratinization, and peeling. Italso modiﬁes keratin synthesis, ﬁbroblastic proliferation,and collagen metabolism.10Topical application ofretinoic acid has been widely proven to improve globalappearance, ﬁne and coarse wrinkling, roughness, pig-mentation, and sallowness in many studies.11,12However,retinoic acid is a prescription formulation that can be irri-tating to the skin and is not used in OTC cosmetics. Onlyless potent forms of vitamin A are available for nonpre-scription use: retinol, retinaldehyde, and retinyl palmitate,which is the ester of retinol combined with palmitic acid.All vitamin A derivatives are converted to their biologi-cally active form, retinoic acid, in the skin.13A few experimental studies have investigated OTC
A few experimental studies have investigated OTCvitamin A derivatives as anti-aging alternatives. In 2000,Varani et al14found that retinol was effective in improv-ing the extracellular matrix of aging skin. They applied1% retinol for 7 days on volunteers over 80 years of age.Histologic study of skin samples revealed increasedﬁbroblast growth and collagen synthesis with decreasedmatrix-degrading matrix metalloproteinases as comparedwith untreated individuals.Some studies on retinyl esters have been promising. In1998, Creidi et al15applied 0.5% retinaldehyde to theskin of volunteers for 18 weeks. They used optical pro-ﬁlometry to determine quantitative calculations of skintexture, wrinkling, roughness, and other surface irregu-larities. With these measurements, they found a signiﬁ-cant reduction of wrinkles and surface roughness of thecrow’s feet area. Vitamin A esters also appear to be pro-tective against the carcinogenic effect of UV radiation. In2003, Antille et al
16reported that application of retinylpalmitate on the buttocks of young adult men exposed toUVB rays inhibited the formation of thymine dimersequivalent to that of SPF 20. However, retinyl palmitatehas not yet been proven to be an effective anti-agingagent. The studies on vitamin A derivatives are promis-ing, but there have been few large-scale double-blindedplacebo-controlled trials investigating the clinical beneﬁtsof any of the OTC vitamin A products.Vitamin B
Vitamin BThere has been minimal investigation of the B vita-mins as anti-aging ingredients, but a few studies havebeen encouraging. In a study in which a group of mid-dle-aged women applied topical niacinamide B3daily toone side of their face and compared it to the other sideas a control for 12 weeks, there were significantimprovements in fine lines and wrinkles, hyperpigment-ed spots, red blotchiness, and skin yellowing. Therewas also quantitative improvement in elasticity .17Nicotinamide, another vitamin B analog, has beenshown in in-vitro culture to increase the synthesis ofceramide, a compound that decreases with aging.18However, the clinical relevance of this analog has notbeen established.A new vitamin B choline analog, called 2-dimethy-laminoethanol (DMAE), has recently been investigated.In 2005, a randomized clinical study by Grossman19
19found that application of 3% DMAE facial gel for 16weeks resulted in improvement of coarse wrinkles,under-eye dark circles, nasolabial folds, sagging neckskin, and neck ﬁrmness. These effects did not regressduring a 2-week cessation of application.

Reports comparing the clinicalappearance of mild to moderately photodamaged facialskin after a 3-month application of 10% topical vitamin C(Cellex-C; Cellex-C International, Toronto, Ontario,Canada) to the hemi-face found statistically signiﬁcantimprovement compared with the untreated hemi-face withrespect to surface texture, ﬁne wrinkling, tactile roughness,coarse rhytids, skin laxity, and sallowness.25
25Many groups have used optical profilometry todemonstrate significant improvements in skin texture,wrinkling, and roughness with vitamin C treat-ment.25,26Histologic proof that vitamin C improvesskin has also been published. In 2002, Fitzpatrick andRostan27applied 10% vitamin C to the cheek of volun-teers and compared it with the opposite untreatedcheek. At 12 weeks, biopsy specimens revealed anincrease in the Grenz zone collagen (the connective tis-sue immediately beneath the epidermis) and increasedgene expression of type I collagen in the skin. Therehave even been significant changes noted with lowerconcentrations of vitamin C. In another randomizeddouble-blinded placebo-controlled study, 5% vitaminC applied to one forearm of volunteers and placebo tothe other forearm for 6 months resulted in increasedexpression of collagen I, collagen III, and tissueinhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase on the treatedside I.28Similar studies with 5% vitamin C also found
28Similar studies with 5% vitamin C also foundan increase in elastic fibers and more uniform distribu-tion of type I collagen bundles .29In 2004, Sauermannet al30investigated the epidermal-dermal junction anddepth of dermal papilla in volunteers of all ages andfound that as people age, the papillae and its nutritivecapillary decrease in density. They then applied topical3% vitamin C on the forearm of volunteers and sawthat there was an increase in the dermal papillae withnew vessel formation after 1 month of treatment, com-pared with the opposite forearm where placebo wasapplied. These studies suggest that vitamin C increasesthe integrity of the extracellular matrix in the skin. Onthe basis of the large body of evidence supporting itsanti-aging effects, topical vitamin C has proven to bean effective ingredient in OTC formulations.Vitamin EVitamin E is a lipophilic antioxidant that occurs
Vitamin E is a lipophilic antioxidant that occursnaturally in the skin. Vitamin E scavenges free radi-cals, preventing their ability to damage the lipid cellmembrane. Forms of vitamin E that may be seen oncosmetic labels are tocopherols and tocotrienols.There have been no clinically applicable human stud-ies demonstrating an anti-aging benefit of topical vita-min E. In in-vitro cultures, some antioxidant effectshave been noted. In 2002, Chung et al31found thathuman dermal fibroblasts treated with vitamin Eshow decreased expression of human macrophagemetalloelastase in response to UVB radiation. In1999, Jones et al32reported that a vitamin E analogsuppressed UVR-induced oxidative stress in humanskin fibroblasts in vitro.32The combination of antioxidant vitamins appears tobe synergistic. On a molecular level, vitamin C helpsregenerate vitamin E from its oxidized form, thusenhancing its antioxidant capacity.6,33Application of

34,35Sunburn cells are keratinocytes undergoingapoptosis—a protective mechanism controlled by tumorsuppressor gene p53 to eliminate cells at risk of malig-nant transformation—and an indicator of UV cellulardamage.36Although vitamin E appears to be protective,more clinical studies need to be performed on humansbefore any conclusions can be made about vitamin E asan anti-aging compound.AntioxidantsOther lipophilic antioxidants found in the skin are co-enzyme Q-10 and squalene. These antioxidants havebeen found to decrease with age and irradiation andhave therefore been investigated as anti-aging prod-ucts.37-39Both ubiquinone and idebenone, a syntheticderivative of coenzyme Q-10, have been used as anantioxidant replacement, but studies have shown thattopical application does not increase their concentrationsin the skin.38There have also been no human clinical
38There have also been no human clinicalstudies studying the efﬁcacy of coenzyme Q-10 or squa-lene as a photoprotective anti-aging agent, and a porcineskin study showed that 1% ubiquinone and 1%idebenone applied topically to pig skin daily for 4 dayshad no photoprotective effect.35402-412_YMAJ456_Huang_CPR  7/25/07  3:48 PM  Page 404Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/asj/article/27/4/402/257852 by guest on 26 September 2024
Aesthetic Surgery Journal ~ July/August 2007 405 The Truth About Over-the-Counter Topical Anti-Aging Products: A Comprehensive ReviewSCIENTIFIC FORUMAlpha lipoic acid (ALA) is an antioxidant that is notnaturally found in the skin but has been used as an addi-tive in cosmetic creams.40-42ALA is a potent reactiveoxygen scavenger and has been found to repair oxidativedamage in vitro.43In an animal study, 0.5% ALA wasapplied to the skin of rats and found to increase collagensynthesis in the dermis and epidermis.44In a randomized,placebo-controlled double-blind study performed byBeitner45in 2003, 5% alpha-lipoic acid was appliedtwice daily to the cheek of volunteers for 12 weeks.Laser proﬁlometry showed 50% decreased skin rough-ness compared with 40% on the placebo, which had car-rier cream of 0.3% coenzyme Q-10 and .03% acetyl-L-
L-carnitine. Although this difference was not statisticallysigniﬁcant, clinical self-assessment by patients reportedsubjective improvement with the ALA-containing cream.Alpha-Hydroxyl AcidsAlpha-hydroxyl acids (AHAs) may be seen on cosmeticproduct labels as glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, cit-ric acid, alpha-hydroxyethanoic acid, alpha-hydroxyoc-tanoic acid, alpha-hydroxycaprylic acid, hydroxycaprylicacid, and hydroxyl fruit acids. Many alpha-hydroxyl acidsoccur naturally in foods. Glycolic acid is present in sugarcane, lactic acid is present in sour milk and tomato juice,malic acid is found in apples, tartaric acid is found ingrapes and wine, citric acid occurs in citrus fruits, andascorbic acid, as mentioned above, is widely found infruits, vegetables, berries, and tea.22The most commonly
22The most commonlyused alpha-hydroxyl acids in cosmetics are glycolic acidand lactic acid. The Food and Drug Administration limitsOTC AHAs to less than 10% concentration. Mild peels of10% to 40% can be used in salons by trained profession-als. Peels with more than 40% AHA concentration can beused only by medical doctors.Alpha hydroxyl acids thin the stratum corneum byreducing corneocyte (the dead layer of surface skin cells)cohesion and speeding up the normal process of skin cellregeneration and exfoliation.46-48At higher concentra-tions of 25%, AHAs can cause increased epidermal orpapillary dermis thickness, increased acid mucopolysac-charides, improved quality of elastic ﬁbers, and increasedcollagen density.49They also can promote increased geneexpression of collagen and hyaluronic acid in the dermisand epidermis.50,51These ﬁndings have been reproducedin many studies and in different species of animals.52-55The degree of exfoliation is directly proportional to
the duration of application, and higher concentrations ofacids have more potent anti-aging effects.22A study com-paring 5% versus 12% lactic acid found that applicationof 12% lactic acid twice daily for 3 months resulted inincreased epidermal and dermal ﬁrmness and thicknesswith clinically improved skin smoothness and appear-ance of lines and wrinkles. With 5% lactic acid, therewere similar clinical and epidermal changes but no mod-ulation of the dermis.However, the clinical changes induced by lower con-centrations of alpha-hydroxyl acids still signiﬁcantlyimprove the appearance of photodamaged skin withoutcausing as much irritation. In 1996, Stiller et al56per-formed a double-blind vehicle-controlled randomizedclinical trial in which 8% glycolic acid or 8% L-lactic
L-lacticacid creams were applied twice daily to the face and out-er forearms for 22 weeks. A signiﬁcant percentage ofpatients had at least one grade of facial improvement(scale 0 to 9) in photodamage compared with placebo.On the forearms, treatment with glycolic acid cream orL-lactic acid cream ameliorated the overall severity ofphotodamage, as demonstrated by decreasing sallowness,mottled hyperpigmentation, and roughness. Extensiveclinical studies have proven alpha hydroxyl acids to bean effective anti-aging compound.BotanicalsPlant polyphenols are responsible for the intrinsic
BotanicalsPlant polyphenols are responsible for the intrinsicantioxidant properties found in botanicals. Polyphenolscan be divided into several classes of chemicals: antho-cyanins, bioflavonoids, proanthocyanidins, catechins,hydroxycinnamic acids, and hydroxybenzoic acids.57Various plants used in anti-aging creams contain thesecompounds. Anthocyanins are found in red wine andberries; bioﬂavonoids are found in citrus fruits, soy-beans, red wine, Ginkgo biloba , and many other vegeta-bles; proanthocyanidins are found in coca, red wine,grape seed extract, green tea, and black tea; catechins arefound in tea, chocolate, apples, pears, grapes, and redwine; hydroxycinnamic acids are found in coffee and redwine; and hydroxybenzoic acids are found in fruits, nuts,tea, and red wine.57Bioﬂavonoids are antioxidant, anticancer, and antiin-ﬂammatory.58-60Bioﬂavonoids also inhibit UV-inducedmatrix metalloproteinases, which cause connective tissuedamage to the skin.
2,61Anthocyanins, a group ofﬂavonoids present in many common vegetables, havebeen shown to decrease UVB-induced DNA fragmenta-tion and reactive oxygen species in human keratinocytes,thereby decreasing cancer formation.62,63Proanthocya-nidins are believed to inhibit production of free radicalsand inﬂammatory pathways, such as histamine, serineprotease, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes.64There have402-412_YMAJ456_Huang_CPR  7/25/07  3:48 PM  Page 405Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/asj/article/27/4/402/257852 by guest on 26 September 2024
406 Aesthetic Surgery Journal ~ July/August 2007 Volume 27, Number 4SCIENTIFIC FORUMbeen many in-vitro cell culture and animal experimentsinvestigating the photoprotective potential of commonlyused botanicals, but relatively few randomized placebo-controlled human clinical studies have been conducted.Several representative ﬁndings are summarized in theTable. Given the limited data, it is not yet possible toformulate any conclusions on the efﬁcacy of botanicals.MoisturizersSkin hydration is important for the overall appear-ance of the skin. Dryness can cause the skin to appeardiscolored, ﬂaky, and rough. The stratum corneum (SC)contains corneocytes held together by a lipid bilayer.Lipid membranes in the stratum corneum comprised ofcholesterol, free fatty acids (the most abundant beinglinoleic acid), and ceramides restrict transepidermalwater loss (TEWL) and maintain the skin barrier.96Corneocytes contain water-soluble molecules called nat-
ural moisturizing factors that allow the skin to bindwater.97It is the combined action of binding water andpreventing water loss that maintains skin hydration andallows the stratum corneum to be soft and ﬂexible.Moisturizers contain occlusives, humectants, andemolients.98,99Occlusives prevent transepidermal waterloss and are comprised of oils or fats such as petroleum,lanolin, mineral oil, vegetable oil, or waxes .96,100Humectants are low-molecular-weight substances thatattract water. Natural moisturizing factors are naturallyoccurring humectants. Common humectants used in mois-turizers are glycerin, propylene glycol, and urea.96Emollients have no hydrating properties, but they are oftenused in moisturizers to act as a ﬁller between desquamatingcorneocytes to allow for a smoother skin surface.There have been only a limited number of studies on
moisturizers published in the literature. Petrolatum—themost commonly used occlusive substance—is able todecrease water loss from the skin by about 50% but doesnot produce any increase in hydration.101,102In the epi-dermis of aged individuals, there is about a 30%decrease in stratum corneum lipid content and signiﬁ-cantly delayed barrier recovery.103Therefore many of theinvestigations of moisturizers have involved topicalapplication and replacement of stratum corneum lipids.In a mouse model, all three lipid components (fattyacids, cholesterol, and ceramide) were necessary for nor-mal barrier repair.104Betz et al105investigated thehydrating power of liposomes—vesicles with a phospho-lipid bilayer membrane identical to natural cell mem-branes—in 2005. They found that a liposome made fromegg phospholipids applied to the forearm increased skinwater content 1.5-fold after 30 minutes and that dailyapplication maintained this level of hydration.
Glycerin (glycerol) and propylene glycol are common-ly used humectants. However, there have been few clini-cal studies demonstrating their hydrating effects. Thebest clinical study investigating the hydrating and protec-tive effects by glycerol was performed by Gloor andGehring106in 2001. Topical application of 85% glycerolemulsion for 3 weeks in volunteers with normal skinresulted in signiﬁcant reduction in TEWL measured bythree different machines. All other studies in the litera-ture on humectants involved experiments on individualswith atopic dermatitis or looked at barrier repair withskin injury. In a study in which glycerol was applied for3 days to tape-stripped and sodium lauryl sulphate–dam-aged skin, faster barrier repair and greater stratumcorneum hydration was seen in glycerol-treated sites.107
107However, the results in the literature are inconsistent. Ina study looking at topical application of 20% glycerin tothe skin of patients with atopic dermatitis, there was nodifference in TEWL compared with placebo.108
108Unfortunately, most of the research on humectantsinvolves subjects with preexisting dry skin conditionswith altered stratum corneum, and the ﬁndings may notbe applicable to the hydration of normal skin.An anti-aging compound that has recently been inves-tigated for its hydrating properties is the vitamin B ana-log nicotinamide, which was discussed previously. In2005, Soma et al109compared topical application of 2%nicotinamide cream with white petrolatum to patientswith atopic dermatitis for 4 weeks. They found that bothsubstances increased stratum corneum hydration, butnicotinamide application was signiﬁcantly more effectiveand resulted in a higher desquamation index anddecreased transepidermal water loss. On a molecular lev-el, human keratinocytes incubated with nicotinamideshowed increased biosynthesis of ceramide, glucosylce-ramide and sphingomyelin, all stratum corneum lipidscrucial to the skin water barrier.110Pentapeptides
110PentapeptidesIn 1993, Katayama et al111found that a subfragmentpentapeptide of type I collagen lysine-threonine-threo-nine-lysine-serine signiﬁcantly increased production oftype I collagen, type III collagen, and ﬁbronectin inhuman lung and dermal ﬁbroblasts in a dose and timedependent manner. To make this peptide more lipophilicand increase its ability to penetrate skin, Lintner112linked it to palmitic acid and patented the pentapeptideknown as palmitoyl-lysine-threonine-threonine-lysine-402-412_YMAJ456_Huang_CPR  7/25/07  3:48 PM  Page 406Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/asj/article/27/4/402/257852 by guest on 26 September 2024

This is the compound that is currentlyused in OTC pentapeptide-based creams.The compound received a signiﬁcant amount of atten-tion after effective anti-aging results were presented atthe 20th World Congress of Dermatology in Paris,France in 2002. In vivo studies of cultured explantedhuman skin incubated with pal-KTTS showed a dose-dependent increase in collagen IV and glycosaminogly-can synthesis.112In a double-blind, placebo-controlledstudy in which .005% (50-ppm) pal-KTTS was appliedto the right eye area of female volunteers twice a day for28 days, optic profilometry revealed a quantitativedecrease in wrinkle depth, wrinkle density, and skinrugosity by 18%, 37%, and 21% respectively.112
112Another study in which 25 volunteers were treated withtwice-daily applications of 3% Matrixyl (Sederma, Paris,France) (a commercial product containing 100-ppm pal-KTTS) to the half-face for 6 months also revealed signiﬁ-cant decreases in wrinkle depth, roughness, wrinkle vol-ume, and main lines density by 21.6%, 16.4%, 24.4%,and 46.8% compared with placebo.113Similar resultswere conﬁrmed in 2005 by Robinson et al,114who usedthe same concentration of pal-KTTS (3 ppm) to treat 93women in a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled,split-face randomized clinical study.When compared with a commercially available creamcontaining 5% vitamin C in 10 volunteers who appliedeither cream on a half-face twice daily for 6 months,wrinkle depth, roughness, wrinkle volume, and main linesdensity decreased signiﬁcantly more on the half-facetreated with Matrixyl as compared with the half-facetreated with vitamin C.113When compared with 0.07%

However, for manypatients, OTC remedies alone may not be sufﬁcient toproduce the desired effects, and prescription-strengthmedications or surgical procedures may be necessary. ■References1.
