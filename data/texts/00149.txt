The aim of this review is to summarize and discuss frequently usedwhitening agents and their e ﬃcacy from a chemical viewpoint. Therefore, a comprehensive literature
survey on teeth whitening agents and products was conducted. The current whitening methods areanalyzed and discussed from a chemist’s viewpoint. Frequently used whitening agents are abrasives(mechanical removal of stains), antiredeposition agents (prevention of deposition of chromophores),colorants (intended to lead to a white color), proteases (degradation of proteins), peroxides (oxidationof organic chromophores), and surfactants (removal of hydrophobic compounds from tooth surface).In-oﬃce bleaching using peroxides is e ﬀective, but side e ﬀects like tooth sensitivity or a damageof the natural organic matrix of enamel and dentin may occur. The applicability of abrasives inteeth whitening is limited due to potential tooth wear, especially when toothpastes with high RDAvalues are used. The e ﬀect of other whitening agents in vivo is often unclear because of a shortage ofplacebo-controlled clinical trials.Keywords: teeth; toothpaste; whitening; peroxides; abrasives
1. IntroductionThe mineral phase of human teeth consists of calcium phosphate in the form of hydroxyapatite,Ca5(PO 4)3(OH) [ 1–5]. The inner part of a tooth is called dentin, which is a protein-rich bone-likebiocomposite containing about 70% hydroxyapatite with proteins (mainly collagen) and water formingthe rest [ 6,7]. Enamel, the outer part of a tooth, is a highly mineralized tissue containing about 97%hydroxyapatite in the form of micrometer-long needles that form a complex hierarchical organizedmicrostructure [ 5,8]. Its hardness and fracture toughness stem from a complex entanglement of thehydroxyapatite needles that are connected via an organic protein phase. The enamel surface itself iscovered by the pellicle, which contains mainly salivary proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids [9,10].The original color of pure hydroxyapatite (i.e., without substituting foreign ions) is colorless /white,
which also broadly holds for the integrated proteins. Consequently, natural enamel has a white colorwith some translucency. However, due to continuous chemical and mechanical wear of enamel withincreasing age (erosion, etc.), the enamel will become thinner and more translucent, i.e., the dentin willbecome more visible and the overall tooth color will become darker [11].Furthermore, the “natural” white color of teeth is often compromised due to stains resultingfrom wine, tea, co ﬀee, smoking, etc. [ 12]. Whitening formulations for home use (e.g., toothpastesin combination with toothbrushes) and professional use in the dental practice (e.g., bleaching orprofessional dental cleaning) try to address this problem. In this context, whitening is deﬁned as anymeans to increase the visual whiteness of a tooth.Dent. J. 2019 ,7, 79; doi:10.3390 /dj7030079 www.mdpi.com /journal /dentistry
Dent. J. 2019 ,7, 79 2 of 13The aim of modern oral care products is to prevent caries and periodontitis, which are commonchallenges of our societies worldwide [ 13–16]. Caries and periodontitis can be prevented mainly bytooth brushing with a manual or electric toothbrush in combination with toothpaste as well as a healthydiet (e.g., low sugar intake, no excessive use of erosive drinks) and lifestyle (e.g., no smoking, low levelsof stress, not being overweight) [ 17,18]. Modern toothpastes are highly complex formulations whichcontain many di ﬀerent agents for the prevention of caries and periodontitis, e.g., ﬂuorides (sodiumﬂuoride, amine ﬂuoride etc.), chlorhexidine, stannous, zinc salts and calcium phosphates such ashydroxyapatite or amorphous calcium phosphates, and surfactants as well as di ﬀerent abrasives for aneﬃcient plaque removal [2,3,15,17,19–22].In addition to that, an increasing number of oral care products also (sometimes mainly) focus on
teeth whitening. This is due to cosmetic reasons, because many people prefer white teeth and a brightsmile as it may also a ﬀect their quality of life [ 23,24]. Lifestyle habits like smoking or consumptionof red wine or black tea can lead to darker teeth [ 25]. Additionally, the tooth color in general alsodepends on the tooth age [11].Consequently, oral care companies have introduced many di ﬀerent teeth whitening products.Here we present an overview of common teeth whitening agents and discuss their e ﬃciency as well aspotential risks from a chemist’s viewpoint. We believe that this will help both dentists and patientsto assess the beneﬁts and the potential risks of whitening treatments. We also hope that some myths(as we would like to call them) that are used to advertise some formulations will be more criticallyconsidered after our thorough assessment from a chemical point of view.2. Staining of the Tooth Surface
2. Staining of the Tooth SurfaceColored compounds in the tooth are so-called chromophores, both of organic and of inorganicorigin [ 26,27]. Chromophores absorb light in the visible range and reflect mainly the complementary colorthat is recognized by the eyes, typically yellow or brownish in the case of teeth. Organic chromophores aresmall organic molecules like tannins or furfurals, e.g., from coffee, tea, red wine, or fruits. Characteristicsof these molecules are double bonds (e.g., carbonyl groups or aromatic groups). Inorganic chromophoresare colored transition metal ions like Fe2+/Fe3+, Cu2+, or Mn2+. In the form of metal complexes, organicand inorganic chromophores may also be present in combination, e.g., in hemoglobin where a coloredporphyrin ligand (organic) is combined with a colored iron ion (inorganic) [26,27].Stains can be of intrinsic and extrinsic origin [ 12,26,27]. Intrinsic stains are localized inside the
tooth, either in the enamel or in the underlying dentin. They can result from excessive ﬂuoride intakeduring tooth formation (ﬂuorosis), from tetracycline incorporation, and a number of metabolic diseasesand systemic factors during tooth development. The severity of ﬂuorosis, for example, can be classiﬁedby Dean’s index, which ranges from questionable, very mild, mild, moderate, and severe [13].Intrinsic staining of teeth happens prior to tooth eruption during tooth development. However,intrinsic staining can also occur after tooth eruption. Mainly pulpal hemorrhagic products followingtrauma may lead to intrinsic discoloration by blood penetration into the dentin tubuli [ 28]. They canalso be caused by dental procedures like amalgam ﬁllings or endodontic treatments. As enamel is asolid structure, abrasive techniques are only able to remove intrinsic stains if they remove part of the
enamel, i.e., the outermost part of a tooth [ 29]. However, this cannot be performed as part of the dailyoral hygiene at home.Another option is the use of chemical bleaching agents that penetrate the enamel structure [ 26,30].
oral hygiene at home.Another option is the use of chemical bleaching agents that penetrate the enamel structure [ 26,30].As most enamel discolorations are caused by developmental malformation or incorporation ofions in the natural enamel structure (e.g., ﬂuorosis), bleaching agents will not completely removethem [ 31]. The removal of intrinsic stains in dentin is almost impossible by any chemical or mechanicalmeans from the outside. Due to the microporous nature of dentin, stains adhere very strongly [ 32].Internal treatments are possible, i.e., by endodontic bleaching with peroxides [ 30], but these proceduresare invasive treatments that are performed in dental clinics only [33].
Dent. J. 2019 ,7, 79 3 of 13Extrinsic staining is present on the tooth surface, i.e., on enamel and exposed dentin, especially ontooth surfaces which are di ﬃcult to clean and on surfaces with a thick pellicle layer [ 26,29,30,32,34].Those stains consist of organic and inorganic chromophores that are either directly adsorbed to thetooth (especially if its surface is rough) or (more likely) incorporated into calculus, bioﬁlm and /orpellicle [ 12]. Chemically, these environments are well suited to host organic and inorganic chromophores.Most organic dyes show a high a ﬃnity to proteins, i.e., it is well conceivable that they are present on orinside plaque and pellicle. Calculus as a predominantly inorganic pathological calciﬁcation, based oncalcium phosphates (i.e., hydroxyapatite (Ca 5(PO 4)3(OH)), whitlockite ( β-(Ca,Mg) 3(PO 4)2), octacalciumphosphate (Ca 8(HPO 4)2(PO 4)4·5 H 2O), and brushite (CaHPO 4·2 H 2O)), is able to incorporate other
inorganic ions (chromophores) into the calcium phosphate lattice [ 1,35]. Their origins are usuallychromophore-containing foods, beverages, or smoking [25].In addition to that, ingredients of oral care products themselves may lead to the staining oftooth surfaces. This is called “indirect staining” because these ingredients typically have a di ﬀerentcolor than the resulting stain [ 32]. Typical examples include stannous ﬂuoride, SnF 2, and otherstannous salts, as well as chlorhexidine (e.g., in form of mouth rinses), which are widely used asantibacterial agents but may have the side e ﬀect of staining the tooth surface, especially after long-termuse [ 32,36,37]. Thus, researchers have proposed alternative anti-bioﬁlm agents that do not stain thetooth surface. Examples include particulate calcium phosphates like hydroxyapatite, which are whitepowders [ 3]. In an in situ study, Kensche et al. showed that a hydroxyapatite mouth rinse (without
other ingredients than water) reduces the initial bacterial colonization to bovine enamel surfaces similarto 0.2% chlorhexidine. This e ﬀect can be explained by anti-adhesive properties of hydroxyapatiteparticles [ 38]. While chlorhexidine is known as an antibacterial agent that inhibits the metabolism ofbacteria, the staining e ﬀect of chlorhexidine is very complex and has been intensively discussed, forexample, by Addy and Moran [32].Notably, chromophores can also be formed by chemical processes (e.g., oxidation) of initiallycolorless compounds. Colored tin sulﬁde, SnS, may result from the chemical reaction of stannousﬂuoride, SnF 2, from a toothpaste with volatile sulfur compounds produced by oral bacteria.Extrinsic stains can be removed by abrasive techniques (e.g., by toothpastes and toothbrush as well asprofessional dental cleaning) and also by chemical treatment (e.g., by peroxides) [26,29,30,34].3. Whiteness of Teeth
3. Whiteness of TeethIn order to assess the performance of a whitening agent, in vitro and in vivo methods have beendeveloped to quantify the degree of whiteness and of staining (e.g., the pellicle cleaning ratio [PCR] is avery prominent in vitro approach) [ 39]. Staining solutions to determine the PCR in vitro often containcoﬀee or tea in order to imitate a natural staining process in the oral cavity [40]. Several methods canbe used to evaluate the tooth color, e.g., a visual assessment using shade guides, spectrophotometry,colorimetry, or computer analysis of digital images [41].The Lobene stain index is commonly used and is based on a visual inspection of the tooth color [ 12].It can only be used to assess extrinsic stains. Staining is classiﬁed regarding its intensity (no stain, lightstain, moderate stain, and heavy stain) and area (no stain detected, stain covering up to 1 /3 of the
region, stain covering >1/3 to 2 /3 of the region, and stain covering >2/3 of the region) [42].Tooth stain can be semi-quantitatively assessed by color shade guides [ 12]. A more quantitative
region, stain covering >1/3 to 2 /3 of the region, and stain covering >2/3 of the region) [42].Tooth stain can be semi-quantitatively assessed by color shade guides [ 12]. A more quantitativeassessment of tooth color and brightness requires the measurement of optical reﬂection spectra asa function of the light wavelength and their interpretation with respect to di ﬀerent colors and theirintensity. Quantitative methods are available, based on the CIEL*a*b* color tables, based on lightness(L*), red /green (a*), and blue /yellow (b*). The numbers can be combined in the CIELab equation togive a relative change in tooth color ∆E [26,34,39].Besides measuring absolute whiteness numbers, the performance of whitening agents is usuallyassessed in a relative way by comparing the whiteness before and after a treatment. A non-uniform
Dent. J. 2019 ,7, 79 4 of 13color of a tooth may complicate the analysis. Positioning splints can be used to identify positions inthe mouth [26].4. In-Oﬃce Teeth Whitening Using PeroxidesTo achieve teeth whitening, many di ﬀerent agents are used, e.g., in commercially availabletoothpastes (Table 1).Table 1. Examples of commonly used whitening agents in products for home and professional use (inalphabetical order; the most e ﬃcient whitening agents are underlined) [12,17].Whitening Agent Mode of ActionAbrasives (e.g., hydrated silica, perlite, alumina)→Most important toothpaste ingredient forstain removalMechanical removal of extrinsic stainsAntiredeposition agents (e.g., polyphosphates,sodium citrate)Prevention of the deposition of chromophores andinhibition of calculus formation where external stainscould be incorporatedCalcium phosphates (e.g., hydroxyapatite)Adhesion of white calcium phosphate particles on thetooth surface, and prevention of bacterial

Chemically, bleaching with hydrogenperoxide (H 2O2; H-O-O-H) or calcium peroxide (CaO 2; Ca2+−O-O−) and related compounds areprominent options [12,26,27,34,43].In-oﬃce bleaching (“power bleaching”) is performed with concentrated solutions of H 2O2in
water (typically 35 wt%) for about 20–30 min. Care must be taken because a concentrated hydrogenperoxide solution is highly oxidizing and harmful to soft tissue. Therefore, gingiva and tongue mustbe protected by suitable means (e.g., rubber dam, water-soaked gauze). In some cases, dental pulpirritation was reported for in-o ﬃce tooth bleaching [ 44]. Furthermore, peroxides are antibacterialagents that may lead to an imbalance (dysbiosis) of the oral microbiome [ 45]. The oxidative action issometimes supported by irradiation with a heat lamp to enhance the oxidative action [ 26]. From achemical viewpoint, this irradiation should not change the oxidative e ﬀect of hydrogen peroxide, butit may enhance the reaction rate due to local temperature increase. In 2000, Viscio et al. stated thatirradiation for activation of hydrogen peroxide has not been clinically validated so far [ 26]. In a clinical
study, no signiﬁcant e ﬀect of light irradiation during the application of 35% hydrogen peroxide wasfound [ 46]. Carey stated in the year 2014 that there is still no proven e ﬀect of an irradiation, neitherfor the amount of whitening achieved nor for the persistence of the whitening treatment during thebleaching process [27].Overnight (“nightguard”) bleaching is accomplished by application of a 10–20% carbamideperoxide-containing gel (see below) in a patient-speciﬁc mouthguard [ 26]. A 10% carbamide gel hasbeen approved by the American Dental Association for home bleaching [ 30,43]. Due to the lowerconcentration of hydrogen peroxide, a number of overnight treatments are necessary to achieve visible
Dent. J. 2019 ,7, 79 5 of 13eﬀects [ 30]. The whitening e ﬀect of both power bleaching and nightguard bleaching was reportedto persist for several years after treatment [ 27,30]. Other bleaching options are paint-on gels andwhitening strips, both based on peroxides [27,43].Note that hydrogen peroxide decomposes over time, especially in the presence of catalyticallyactive compounds like metal ions, noble metals (Pt), and enzymes (catalase), according to(I) H2O2→H2O+12O2.The released oxygen molecule can act as an oxidant. However, the normal oxidative action ofhydrogen peroxide depends on the pH value:(II) H2O2+2 H++2 e−→2 H 2O, or(III) H2O2+2 e−→2 OH−.This also happens after hydrolysis of peroxide-precursor compounds that releasehydrogen peroxide:(IV) MgO 2+2 H 2O→Mg(OH) 2+H2O2(magnesium peroxide);(V) CaO 2+2 H 2O→Ca(OH) 2+H2O2(calcium peroxide);(VI) Na2(CO 4)+H2O→Na2CO 3+H2O2(sodium percarbonate);
(VII) CO(NH 2)2·H2O2→CO(NH 2)2+H2O2(carbamide peroxide, an adduct of urea and hydrogenperoxide, contains about 36 wt% hydrogen peroxide).Chemically, the conjugated systems of unsaturated organic compounds (like aromatic compounds,alkenes, alkynes) that absorb light in the visible spectrum and therefore act as chromophores are oxidizedby peroxides so that light is no longer absorbed. The underlying chemical reactions are manifoldand complex. In short, bleaching with peroxides leads to the oxidation of organic chromophores tonon-colored organic compounds. It is tacitly assumed that these organic compounds are removed fromthe tooth surface by subsequent washing steps. Notably, inorganic ions like Fe3+are not oxidized byperoxides and remain colored after the treatment. However, it is chemically reasonable to assume thatthey are also removed after surrounding (bio-)organic molecules have been destroyed by oxidation
so that the ions are released into the surrounding bleaching liquid [ 26,30]. The overall kinetics ofthese complex chemical reactions are not known. Consequently, Fearon has stated that the degree ofwhitening can be only insu ﬃciently controlled during power bleaching [30].5. Whitening ToothpastesDedicated whitening toothpastes are on the market, e.g., for smokers [ 12]. Additionally, alsomany “multifunctional” or “all-in-one” toothpastes claim whitening e ﬀects. They often contain specialabrasives and /or whitening agents (see Table 1).To analyze the e ﬃciency of whitening toothpastes, in vitro (usually on extracted human teeth oranimal teeth) and in vivo studies (usually clinical trials) have been performed [ 12,17]. For whiteningtoothpastes, we also distinguish between (external) stain prevention and (external) stain removal.Abrasives are the most important ingredients in toothpaste formulations for an e ﬃcient stain
removal [ 17]. Whitening toothpastes often (but not always) contain harder abrasives and a higheramount of these than conventional toothpastes to achieve a su ﬃcient abrasion of external stains(Table 2) [ 12,26,29,47]. In general, a toothpaste with a high abrasivity will remove the outer part of theenamel, including the attached and the incorporated stains. The demand for a high polishing action(with high whitening e ﬀect) is constrained by the potential damage to the outer tooth layer (enameland exposed dentin).
Dent. J. 2019 ,7, 79 6 of 13Table 2. Overview of commonly used abrasives in toothpastes [ 47]. Hard abrasives remove stains moreeﬃciently than soft abrasives; however, they may be harmful to the enamel and specially to exposeddentin (INCI: International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients).Name (INCI) Chemical FormulaRelativeHardnessExpected StainRemovalSodium bicarbonate NaHCO 3 Soft LowDicalcium phosphate dihydrate (brushite) CaHPO 4·2 H 2O Soft LowCalcium carbonate CaCO 3 Soft LowCalcium pyrophosphate Ca 2P2O7 Medium hard MediumHydroxyapatite Ca 5(PO 4)3(OH) Medium hard MediumHydrated silica SiO 2·n H 2O Medium hard MediumPerlite A mineral silicate Hard HighAlumina Al 2O3 Hard HighThus, the abrasivity of a toothpaste is limited by a potentially harmful action on the enamel,exposed dentin, and gingiva by compounds that are too abrasive. In contrast, a toothpaste withlow abrasivity (e.g., for sensitive teeth; gentle cleaning of exposed dentin) may lead to increased
staining of the tooth surface because of lower cleaning e ﬃcacy. Common abrasives are hydratedsilica, SiO 2·n H 2O, calcium carbonate, CaCO 3, and alumina, Al 2O3(Table 2). Additionally, theseabrasives may vary in particle size, morphology, and hardness [ 29,47]. Especially, the properties ofsilica abrasives strongly depend on various parameters such as water content, cross-linking, particleshape, and particle size [47].Particulate hydroxyapatite is a biomimetic agent used in preventive oral care [2,15,19,20,38,48,49] .Additionally, it also appears as promising abrasive due to its similarity to tooth minerals, besides awhitening e ﬀect that is not only due to polishing but also to its presence on the tooth surface [ 50].It was shown that hydroxyapatite particles attach to the enamel [ 38,51]. However, a low concentrationof hydroxyapatite particles leads to a lower surface coverage of the tooth [ 52]. Other white pigments
(e.g., TiO 2) show a higher refractive index than calcium phosphates, but are not biomimetic.Another application form is a coating of the teeth with calcium phosphate in the form of a polymer-basedgel or by using high concentrations of hydroxyapatite [52].Dabanoglu et al. have reported an in vitro study with particulate hydroxyapatite and obtained goodwhitening results on extracted human premolars [ 53]. Jin et al. have reported some whitening effectsof various calcium phosphate particles in a toothpaste that also contained carboxymethylcellulose onextracted human teeth [ 54]. Scanning electron micrographs in both publications did not indicate a denselayer of calcium phosphate particles on the tooth surface. Hence, the reason for the whitening effectis basically unknown [ 53,54]. Kim et al. reported that the whitening effect of a hydroxyapatite-basedtoothpaste was comparable with two commercial toothpastes, but the full composition of the toothpastes
was not given [ 55]. Bommer et al. reported on a combined in vitro /in vivo study on nanohydroxyapatiteand a self-assembling peptide matrix as a glue to the tooth surface and observed a significant whiteningeffect that they ascribed to diffuse reflection by hydroxyapatite particles on the tooth surface [ 56].Lelli et al. demonstrated how a zinc-carbonate hydroxyapatite-containing toothpaste can lead to particleadsorption on the tooth surface [ 51]. Fabritius-Vilpoux et al. quantitatively studied the interactionbetween teeth and particulate hydroxyapatite in vitro and showed a dose-response relationship [52].Much e ﬀort is directed to developing abrasives that remove stains with a minimal damagingeﬀect on the enamel [ 47]. The RDA value (radioactive dentin abrasion) is an accepted way to expressthe abrasive performance of toothpastes. Toothpastes with RDA values below 250 are generally
accepted as safe. A means to assess the cleaning e ﬀect of toothpastes and abrasives is the PCR
the abrasive performance of toothpastes. Toothpastes with RDA values below 250 are generallyaccepted as safe. A means to assess the cleaning e ﬀect of toothpastes and abrasives is the PCRvalue (pellicle cleaning ratio) [ 12]. In general, a high RDA value is associated with a high PCRvalue as both parameters are based on the same e ﬀect (mechanical abrasion on the tooth surface).However, the mathematical correlation between both parameters is not very pronounced [ 19,26,47,57].
Dent. J. 2019 ,7, 79 7 of 13Furthermore, the abrasiveness of toothpaste formulations is also a ﬀected by many other factors liketoothbrush ﬁlaments, etc.Bleaching compounds in whitening toothpastes are also peroxide-based. Due to the chemicalinstability of hydrogen peroxide, other compounds like calcium peroxide, sodium percarbonate,and magnesium peroxide are used. After hydrolysis, they release H 2O2that will then exert itsbleaching action. From a chemical point of view, it is clearly important to assure that the shelflife of this bleaching compound is su ﬃciently long because (in most cases) toothpastes are alsowater-based formulations.Bleaching compounds in cosmetics, such as toothpastes, are legally regulated due to their potentialharms. In particular, due to safety concerns, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in cosmetictoothpastes is usually limited to about 1 wt%; in the European Union it is limited to a maximum of
0.1 wt% [ 26,29]. From a chemical viewpoint, it is questionable whether such a low peroxide concentrationwill lead to a sufficient oxidizing power in a toothpaste. This is based on the inherent instability ofhydrogen peroxide in an aqueous formulation and on the short contact time during toothbrushing(about 2–3 min) and the additional dilution due to salivary flow [29]. Activating agents like transitionmetal ions have been proposed to enhance the oxidative capacity of hydrogen peroxide [ 26]. It hasbeen stated by Demarco et al. that whitening toothpastes work only by their abrasive effect and not bybleaching [ 43]. In contrast, Joiner has cited a number of studies where whitening toothpastes containingaround 1% peroxide have shown a significant whitening effect. However, only in vitro studies werediscussed [ 12]. Another study states that the efficacy of several whitening-agents used in toothpastes,such as peroxides, is debatable [29].
such as peroxides, is debatable [29].Besides peroxides, many other whitening agents are commercially available and used in oralcare products. This includes, surface active agents (surfactants), antiredeposition agents, colorants,enzymes, and polyaspartate [12,17,26].Surfactants remove hydrophobic compounds from the tooth surface by solubilization as incleaning applications (soap, washing powder etc.) [ 12,29]. Frequently used surfactants in toothpasteformulations are e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and cocamidopropyl betaine [17].Antiredeposition agents are expected to prevent the subsequent deposition of chromophores afterthe whitening procedure [ 26,29]. They also act as calculus control agents that inhibit the formationof calculus where external stains may be incorporated [ 29]. Polyphosphates and sodium citrate aretypical antiredeposition components. They are intended to prevent the formation of calculus, which is
basically a pathological deposition of calcium phosphate phases from saliva [ 8,58,59]. It is assumedthat they have a strong adsorption a ﬃnity to the tooth surface. They can also bind colored inorganicions and prevent their deposition [ 26]. The e ﬃciency of antiredeposition components in whiteningtoothpastes has been demonstrated [ 60]. Pyrophosphate, sodium trimetaphosphate (STP), and sodiumhexametaphosphate (HMP) are typical examples of substances that are used in whitening toothpasteswith proven performance [ 12,29]. A relatively new approach is the use of polyaspartate in whiteningformulations. A toothpaste with sodium polyaspartate showed better stain preventing properties than acontrol toothpaste in vivo [9]. Sodium polyaspartate contains many carboxy groups. These may lead toan interference either with the tooth-surface or with the pellicle, leading to a di ﬀerent color-absorptionand reﬂection.

Colorants are speciﬁc dyes that are intended to give the teeth a white color. It is yet unclearwhether they will attach to the teeth after brushing [ 26]. However, papers reported the successfulapplication of novel whitening toothpastes containing the blue dye covarine that shifts the reﬂectedcolor of teeth from yellow into the blue region, thus leading to a whiter appearance [12,61].Enzymes (proteases) which selectively degrade proteins by hydrolysis of peptide bonds may be apotential approach as future whitening agents [ 26]. An example is the use of the protease enzymepapain. Papain consists of 212 amino acids and can be isolated from papayas [ 62]. Joiner discussedthe use of papain with conﬂicting clinical results [ 12]. Whitening toothpastes with papain havenbeen combined with bromelain extracts [ 63]. Papain and bromelain are both cysteine proteases
Dent. J. 2019 ,7, 79 8 of 13(endopeptidases). This means that they have a cysteine in their active site that covalently attaches totarget proteins for subsequent cleavage [ 64]. By protein degradation, the characteristics (absorptionmaximum, extinction coe ﬃcient) of their chromophores can be changed, leading to less light absorptionin the visible range. Lysozymes and peroxidases have also been used in toothpastes [ 65]. However,when using enzymes, special emphasis must be given to the storage conditions. Most enzymes are onlystable for a short time at room temperature. Even during the production process and at the transportand storage temperatures, an inactivation may occur.Furthermore, an increasing number of toothpastes with activated charcoal are commerciallyavailable. Activated charcoal is a nanocrystalline form of carbon with a high speciﬁc surface area(>1000 m2g−1) and a high number of pores in the nanometer range. It can be prepared by heating organic
materials like wood or coal. Activated charcoal is typically used as an adsorbent in di ﬀerent applications.The application of activated charcoal in whitening toothpastes, however, has not yet been studiedin detail [ 66]. A recently published in vitro study compared toothpastes of di ﬀerent manufacturescontaining di ﬀerent whitening formulations, i.e., with activated charcoal, blue covarine, hydrogenperoxide, or polyethylene microbeads. It was concluded that the toothpastes with polyethylenemicrobeads and blue covarine were most e ﬀective in teeth whitening [66].In addition to whitening toothpastes, whitening mouth rinses, whitening stripes, whitening dentalﬂoss, and whitening chewing gums have been reported in the literature. Whitening mouth rinsescontaining a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide (1.5%) and sodium hexametaphosphate havebeen applied with moderate success [ 43]. Furthermore, mouth rinses do not contain any abrasives, i.e.,
the stain removal properties are generally inferior to a toothpaste. Whitening dental ﬂoss has beenbrought to the market (coated with abrasive silica), but up to 2009, no clinical report was published [ 43].Whitening chewing gum, containing sodium hexametaphosphate, did not show a better performancethan normal chewing gum [43].The clinical e ﬃciency of whitening toothpastes is controversially debated in the literature.Walsh et al. reported a clinical study where a standard toothpaste was compared to a dedicatedwhitening toothpaste. The e ﬀect after 1, 4, and 6 weeks was not very pronounced and within thestatistical error margin [ 67]. Demarco et al. noted that, “Although whitening toothpastes can preventextrinsic tooth stains, the whitening e ﬀect obtained seems not to be clinically signiﬁcant,” and gavereferences for this statement [ 43]. Da Silva et al. performed a cyclic smoke incubation /brushing of
bovine tooth discs for seven weeks. Neither the whitening toothpastes nor a conventional toothpastewere able to prevent the staining of the tooth surface [ 25]. Imfeld and Sener suggested that the term“whitening” should be deﬁned in more detail in order to di ﬀer between “normal” and whiteningtoothpastes [68].6. Potential Risks of Teeth Whitening ConceptsIn teeth, an inorganic mineral (calcium phosphate in the form of hydroxyapatite) is combinedwith an organic protein matrix. Only the chemical and structural interplay between these twocomponents leads to the extraordinary mechanical properties of teeth with respect to hardness andfracture toughness. Thus, teeth are not simply inorganic materials but highly optimized and complexorganic-inorganic biocomposites. If aggressive bleaching agents like hydrogen peroxide are applied inhigh concentrations, it will also damage the organic matrix in the tooth, especially in dentin. We note
that enamel contains about 1% organic matrix and dentin contains about ca. 20% organic matrix, mainly
that enamel contains about 1% organic matrix and dentin contains about ca. 20% organic matrix, mainlycollagen [ 8]. This could lead to a mechanical weakening of the tooth due to a decreasing integration ofthe calcium phosphate crystals. Fearon discussed a number of studies of di ﬀerent whitening proceduresand concluded that changes in the tooth surface structure and increased tooth sensitivity can occur,especially if highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide solutions are applied. There are also reportsabout a structural damage of enamel surface prisms after application of 35% carbamine peroxide [ 30].The risk of adverse e ﬀects will increase with the peroxide concentration. In contrast, a chemical reactionbetween calcium phosphate and peroxides is very unlikely.
Dent. J. 2019 ,7, 79 9 of 13An increased tooth sensitivity (bleaching sensitivity) after power bleaching, which persisteda few days, has also been reported [ 30,69–71]. Bleaching sensitivity often occurs after bleachingbecause small microscopic defects and subsurface pores are caused by the whitening agents (peroxide).This sensitivity is caused by reversible pulpitis, leading to thermal tooth sensitivity [ 72]. A possiblestrategy to reduce tooth sensitivity after bleaching is the use of oral care products containing particulatehydroxyapatite [ 73–77] or potassium nitrate [ 78]. Clearly, the factors “white teeth” (with a positiveinﬂuence on the quality of life) and “tooth sensitivity” (with a negative inﬂuence on the quality of life)are related [23].Strong (hard) abrasives like perlite and alumina have a higher hardness than hydroxyapatite (i.e.,the tooth mineral) and may not only damage enamel and exposed dentin, but also the gingiva during
stain removal, especially when high pressure is applied during tooth brushing. The RDA value, ingeneral, only gives limited information as it measures the abrasion of dentin and not of the muchharder enamel. The correlation between PCR and RDA is low [ 47], but nevertheless exists, therefore acompromise must always be sought between a good stain removal e ﬃciency and the protection ofteeth and gingiva.It is unclear whether bleaching leads to a long-term damage of the teeth due to oxidation of theconstituting organic molecules. This damage may a ﬀect the mechanical integrity of a tooth (enameland dentin). Additionally, enhanced tooth sensitivity (bleaching sensitivity) is a common side e ﬀectfollowing the use of peroxides [69,71,79].7. ConclusionsFor whitening, two major approaches can be distinguished, as follows: Chemical bleaching byperoxides and mechanical cleaning by toothpaste abrasives. Chemical bleaching leads to good results,
especially when it is performed with high peroxide concentrations in a controlled environment, i.e., inthe dental practice. Mechanical cleaning relies on suitable abrasives that are harder than stains but lesshard than enamel. Considerable progress into this direction has been achieved with silica toothpasteformulations in the last years (optimized RDA /PCR ratio) [ 47,80], but current formulations alwaysrepresent a compromise between desired cleaning e ﬃciency and unwanted tooth abrasion.It is not always easy to interpret the results of in vitro studies and clinical studies in the ﬁeld ofteeth whitening. They are not always randomized and, often, more than one parameter is changed.For instance, an enzyme-containing toothpaste should ideally be compared to exactly the same productwithout the enzyme (placebo). However, for practical reasons, new formulations with di ﬀerentabrasives, additives, etc., are often compared to toothpastes on the market. The simultaneous change
of more than one parameter makes deﬁnite conclusions di ﬃcult or even impossible. It is oftennot clear which agent in a toothpaste formulation contributes to the whitening e ﬀect and to whatextent. This should be addressed in further studies by comparing whitening agents separately, i.e.,a non-abrasive gel formulation with enzymes vs. the same gel formulation with colorants. Otherwise,there will always be synergetic e ﬀects of di ﬀerent whitening agents because toothpastes are complexformulations (abrasives, enzymes, surfactants, etc.) causing an equally complex response in themouth [ 17]. The whitening market has a large economic volume, i.e., the competition betweenmanufacturers is high, and not all claims are based on solid scientiﬁc evidence. In general, a greatchallenge for planning and conducting clinical studies in the ﬁeld of teeth whitening is the selection ofpopulation-representative inclusion criteria as teeth staining is strongly correlated to the diet and other
factors (like smoking, chlorhexidine).
population-representative inclusion criteria as teeth staining is strongly correlated to the diet and otherfactors (like smoking, chlorhexidine).Finally, the modes of action of many whitening agents in vivo are still unknown. Thus, mechanisticstudies are required to understand the mechanisms of action from a chemical and biological viewpoint,which is an important requirement for the development of more e ﬃcient teeth whitening formulations.Besides whitening of natural teeth (see above), another important research ﬁeld is the prevention andremoval of stains on restauration materials, e.g., of polymer-based composites [81–84].
