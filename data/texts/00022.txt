Chromatographic analysis demonstrated the presence of the tannin (ellagic acid) andﬂavonoids (quercetin and gallic acid) which characterize the EDE as a polyphenol-rich mixture. Using HFF-1ﬁbroblasts, it was shown that EDE promoted cell regeneration after UVA exposure. It also led to the inhibition of
the collagenase, elastase and tyrosinase enzymes, which are involved in skin-related disorders. In terms oftoxicological evaluation, the EDE was classi ﬁed as non-phototoxic through the 3T3 Neutral Red UptakePhototoxicity Test (OECD N° 432, 2004) and non-eye irritant by Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability(OECD N° 437, 2013) assay, in conjunction with corneal histomorphometric analysis. Furthermore, the EDE hasno skin sensitization potential as demonstrated by a two-out-of-three prediction model [protein-binding/haptenization (OECD N° 442C, 2015), keratinocyte and dendritic cell activations]. In addition, it was shown thatthe EDE seems to be non-genotoxic through the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (OECD N° 487, 2014) usingHepG2 cells. When considered together, these ﬁndings support the use of EDE botanical mixture in cosmetic/pharmaceutical products.1. IntroductionBrazilian biodiversity comes from six di ﬀerent biomes: Amazônia
(the Amazon rainforest found in northern and mid-western Brazil),Cerrado (the central Brazilian savanna), Mata Atlântica (the Atlanticrainforest stretching from the coast to Brazil's eastern highlands),Caatinga (the North-eastern xerophilous forest and drylands), Pampa(the Southern Brazilian grasslands) and Pantanal (the Mid-westernBrazilian ﬂooded grasslands) ( Dutra et al., 2016; IBGE, 2004 ). Studieshave demonstrated that this giant biodiversity has great potential forthe development of new drugs, cosmetics, agrochemicals and dietarysupplements ( Joly et al., 2011). Therefore, native plants play animportant economic and biotechnological role as a result of theincreasing global interest of pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic com-http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tiv.2017.04.002

panies in plant-derived products ( Bowe, 2013; Caramori et al., 2004;Dutra et al., 2016; Pereira, 2009; Zillich et al., 2015).The Cerrado's ,Eugenia dysenterica DC. (Myrtaceae), a polyphenol-rich plant, popularly known as cagaita orcagaiteira (Almeida et al.,1998 ), has traditionally been used by local populations because of itstherapeutic properties and nutritional resources, recently explored byfood companies. In addition, its leaves have showed potential for use indermocosmetic formulations given their in vitro potent tyrosinaseinhibitory activity ( Souza et al., 2012a ). Recently, our group has shownthat a complex botanical mixture based on E. dysenterica leaf hydro-alcoholic extract (EDE) has in vitro antioxidant activity and chemopre-ventive e ﬀects associated with its high levels of polyphenols ( Ávilaet al., 2016; Couto et al., 2009). Several studies have also highlightedits antioxidant properties due to the presence of phytochemicals
(Clementino et al., 2016; Prado et al., 2014; Takao et al., 2015 ). Itsfruit, which are sources of folates, carotenoids, vitamins A and C andphenolic compounds (e.g. quercetin, kaempferol and ellagic acid)(Cardoso et al., 2011; Gonçalves et al., 2010 ), also present antioxidantproperties ( Gonçalves et al., 2010; Roesler et al., 2007), although inquantities lower than those found in the leaves ( Ávila et al., 2016 ).Other biological activities have been associated with E. dysenterica,corroborating its use in folk medicine, such as its antiviral ( Cecílioet al., 2012 ) and antifungal ( Correia et al., 2016 ) properties, α-amylaseandα-glucosidase inhibitory activity ( Souza et al., 2012b), antidiar-rhoeic ( Galheigo et al., 2016; Lima et al., 2011 ) and gastroprotectiveeﬀects ( Prado et al., 2014).In the cosmetic ﬁeld, the use of complex botanical mixtures such asoils, butters and extracts, obtained with an ecological sustainable
approach, has driven research with a focus on developing eco-friendlyproducts, rich in natural raw materials ( Fonseca-Santos et al., 2015;Pereira, 2009 ). The many biological properties of these mixtures, whichinclude anti-in ﬂammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant and photo-protective e ﬀects, have boosted this development, especially in the ﬁeldof anti-aging skin products ( Mukherjee et al., 2011; Nichols andKatiyar, 2010; Saewan and Jimtaisong, 2015).Contrary to popular beliefs, natural products may not be free oftoxicity. For example, Hypericum perforatum , a medicinal plant widelyused in traditional medicine, has been reported as a high skinphotosensitizer ( Marrelli et al., 2014 ). Thus, risk evaluation of theraw materials and the ﬁnishedproduct, must be carried out to meet theregulatory criteria and obtain information related to human safety(Andres et al., 2013). For such purposes, several toxicological endpoints
in the regulatory context have historically been conducted throughanimal testing ( Bauch et al., 2012). However, in di ﬀerent parts of theworld political and public concern for animal welfare and currentscienti ﬁc development have made the use of animal testing unsustain-able, especially as regards e ﬃcacy and toxicological evaluations ofcosmetic ingredients and their products ( Strickland et al., 2016 ). InBrazil, four States (São Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná and Pará)banned animal testing for cosmetics whereas all European Unioncountries have fully prohibited them since 2009 ( European Union,2003, 2009 ).In the context of developing new natural product-based cosmetics,the eﬃcacy of EDE, as a protective/functional natural raw material foruse in cosmetic formulations, was investigated. Given the particularityof the EDE mixture, namely, that it could be used in dermal prepara-tions for daily use, and that it is widely used, several toxicological
endpoints were also investigated to determine its safety pro ﬁle forhuman exposure.2. Material and methods2.1. Chemicals

Obtaining EDEE. dysenterica leaves were collected from a specimen located in NovaAmérica, Goiás, Brazil (674 m, 15° 00 29.5 ″South, 49° 59 0.5 ″West)and identi ﬁed by Dr. José Realino de Paula. A voucher specimen wasdeposited in the Herbarium of the Federal University of Goiás (UFG N°41,319). The hydroalcoholic extract was obtained by percolating leaf
powder (1 kg) in an ethanol:water solution (70:30, v/v). This wasfollowed by spray drying, and yielded 19.5% (w/w) ( Couto et al., 2011,2013 ).In cell-based assays, a stock solution of EDE (250 mg/mL) wasprepared in DMSO and ultrapure water (1:1, v/v), kept in an ultrasonicbath for 20 min at room temperature and ﬁltered through a 0.22 μmmembrane. The solution was stored at −20 °C.2.3. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of EDEThe EDE solution was centrifuged at 14,500 rpm for 5 min, and500μL of supernatant were used for HPLC analysis. The possiblecompounds present in the EDE were identi ﬁed by comparing theirretention times with those of reference standard phytochemicals. Thesystem used was an Agilent 1200 series chromatographer (AgilentTechnologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), equipped with an autosamplerand a diode array UV detector.

and 280 nm (for gallic acid and ellagic acid).2.4. Cell culturesBalb/c 3T3-A31 ﬁbroblasts were kindly donated by Dr. Mari CleideSogayar (Chemistry Institute, University of São Paulo, SP, Brazil); whileHepG2 liver cells, HFF-1 human foreskin ﬁbroblasts, HaCaT humanimmortalized keratinocytes and human myeloid U937 cells wereobtained from the Rio de Janeiro Cell Bank (Rio de Janeiro, RJ,Brazil). The cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (for U937 cells) orDMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 4.5 mM HEPES, 0.17 M sodium bicarbonate and 100 IU/mLpenicillin G, in a humidi ﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2in air at 37 °C.2.5. Inhibition of collagenase, elastase and tyrosinase activitiesThe evaluation of collagenase, elastase and tyrosinase inhibitoryactivities was carried out, using as a basis the methods described byThring et al. (2009) ,Kim et al. (2004) andHearing (1987) , respectively,with some modi ﬁcations. Brie ﬂy, for the collagenase assay, 10 μLo f
diﬀerent concentrations of EDE (5 –100μg/mL) were mixed with 10 μLof collagenase (10 mg/mL), diluted in bu ﬀer tricine pH 7.5 (tricine50 mM, NaCl 400 mM and CaCl 210 mM), and placed in a 96-well ﬂatmicroplate. The plate was then incubated at room temperature for15 min, after which 100 μL of FALGPA (1.6 mM) dissolved in bu ﬀerwere added. Absorbance was measured at 340 nm immediately andagain after 20 min. For the elastase assay, 10 μL of each concentrationof EDE were mixed with 90 μL of elastase (0.2 mg/mL) diluted inultrapure water, after which the plate was incubated at 37 °C for15 min. Then, 100 μL of AAAPVN (0.8 mM), dissolved in bu ﬀer Tris-HCl pH 7.5 (60 mM), were added and absorbance was measured at405 nm immediately and again after 50 min. For the tyrosinase assay,20μL of EDE concentrations were mixed with 80 μL of tyrosinase(25μg/mL) prepared with bu ﬀer monobasic potassium phosphatepH 6.5 (10 mM). The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and then
100μL of L-DOPA (1 mM) dissolved in bu ﬀer were added to each well.Absorbance was measured immediately at 492 nm and again after20 min. For the assays, blank and control groups were constituted.From the optical density (OD) values, the inhibitory activity of eachenzyme was obtained according to the following equation: inhibition(%) = 100 –[(ODﬁnal sample –ODinitial sample ) / (OD ﬁnal control –ODinitialcontrol )] × 100.2.6. Determination of sun protection factor (SPF)The SPF evaluation was undertaken according to the methodproposed by Mansur et al. (1986) . Ethanolic solutions of EDE (12.5,25 or 50 μg/mL) were submitted to photometric scanning, using aspectrophotometer (Varian Carry 50 UV-VIS, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at200–400 nm, to assess at which wavelength the greatest absorption ofEDE would be obtained. Emulsions containing EDE at 0.1, 0.5 and 1%(p/v) were then prepared using a self-emulsifying base (Hostacerin ®
SAF). A formulation control was prepared using octyl methoxycinna-mate (OMC), a sunscreen compound, at 3.7 or 7.35% (p/v). Photo-metric scanning was performed with the formulations and the SPF wasobtained according to the following equation: SPF = CF x290Σ320290EE(λ)xI( λ) x abs ( λ), where: CF (correction factor) = 10; EE( λ)= erythermal e ﬃciency spectrum; I( λ) = solar intensity spectrum;abs(λ) = absorbance of the sunscreen solution in the wavelength ( λ).2.7. Photoprotection and cell regeneration analysesAn assessment of the cell regeneration and photoproctective e ﬀectsof EDE was carried out as described by Liu and Min (2011) . For thephotoprotection assay, the HFF-1 cells (6 × 104cells/mL) were seededinto 96-well ﬂat microplates and left overnight. The plates were thenwashed with HBSS and treated with complete culture medium (controlcells), vehicle (DMSO at 0.1%) or eight concentrations of EDE(10–300μg/mL) for 2 h. The plates were then washed twice with HBSS
and 100 μL of this bu ﬀer were added to each well. After that, one plate
(10–300μg/mL) for 2 h. The plates were then washed twice with HBSSand 100 μL of this bu ﬀer were added to each well. After that, one platewas covered with aluminum foil (UVA-) to protect it from the light,while another was exposed to 10 J/cm2UVA (UVA+) using anirradiation chamber (Caron, model 6545– 2, OH, USA). The UVA lightof the chamber was previously calibrated using an UVA meter (model732, CHY Firemate CO., LTD., Tainan, Taiwan). The plates werewashed again with HBSS and complete medium was added to eachwell. After 24 h of incubation, cell viability was evaluated by MTTassay. Thus, 10 μL/well of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) were added to eachwell and the plate incubated for 3 h. After that, the plate wascentrifuged at 800 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was removed andDMSO (100 μL/well) was added to solubilize the formazan formed. Theplate was shaken on a microplate shaker (Orbit ™P4, Labnet, Edison,NJ, USA) for 20 min in the dark, at 25 rpm, and absorbance was
measured at 545 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (ThermoScienti ﬁc Multiskan ®Spectrum, Boston, MA, USA). The same protocolwas undertaken for the cell regeneration analysis; however, thetreatment with EDE concentrations was carried out after UVA- orUVA+ exposure.2.8. 3T3 neutral red uptake (NRU) phototoxicity assayThe phototoxicity analysis of EDE was performed according toOECD test guideline N° 432 ( OECD, 2004 ). Before performing the assay,UVA light of the irradiation chamber (Caron, model 6545 –2, OH, USA)was calibrated to achieve an UVA irradiance of 1.7 mW/cm2(resultingdose: 1 J/cm2per 10 min of exposure) using an UVA meter (model 732,CHY Firemate CO., LTD., Tainan, Taiwan). In brief, the 3T3 cells(1 × 104cells/well) were seeded into 96-well ﬂat microplates andincubated overnight. The plates were then washed with HBSS andtreated with 100 μL of HBSS, amiodarone HCL (positive control) or 8diﬀerent concentrations of EDE (1.56 –100μg/mL, diluted in HBSS), for
1 h. Then one plate was exposed to UVA (UVA+, 5 J/cm2) for 50 minusing an irradiation chamber, while another was protected from light(UVA-). After that, the plates were washed with HBSS and completemedium was added to each well. After incubating for 24 h, the plateswere washed with HBSS and neutral red (50 μg/mL) diluted in DMEMwas added to each well and left to incubate for 3 h. The supernatant wasdiscarded and the cells were washed with HBSS. After that, 150 μLo fneutral red desorb solution (50 ethanol:1 acetic acid:49 ultrapurewater) were added to all wells and shaken for 20 min at 25 rpm.Absorbance was measured at 540 nm. The Phototox version 2.0 soft-ware, provided by OECD, was used to calculate the photoirritationfactor (PIF), mean photo e ﬀect (MPE) and concentration that inhibitedcell growth in 50% compared to untreated cells (IC50) for each testsubstance. According to these parameters, test material can be classi ﬁed
as non-phototoxic (PIF < 2 or MPE < 0.1), probably phototoxic(2 < PIF < 5 or 0.1 < MPE < 0.15) or phototoxic (PIF > 5 orMPE > 0.15) ( OECD, 2004; Spielmann et al., 1998 ).2.9. Skin sensitization evaluation2.9.1. Micro-direct peptide reactivity assay (mDPRA)The assay was conducted based on OECD test guideline N° 442C(OECD, 2015 ) and DPRA DB-ALM protocol N° 154, n.d. (https://ecvam-dbalm.jrc.ec.europa.eu/methods-and-protocols/topic/sensitisation-and-allergy/key/t_41# ), with a modi ﬁcation in the reaction volume(from 1 mL to 0.1 mL), herein called mDPRA ( Ávila et al., 2017b).Brieﬂy, prior to use peptides containing cysteine and lysine weresolubilized in phosphate (100 mM sodium phosphate monobasic,100 mM sodium phosphate dibasic; pH 7.5) and ammonium acetate(100 mM) bu ﬀers, respectively, in a ﬁnal concentration of 0.667 mM,while stock solutions of EDE (3.45 mg/mL) and DNCB (positive control;L.C. Moreira et al. Toxicology in Vitro 45 (2017) 397–408399
100 mM) were prepared in methanol and acetonitrile, respectively.From the stock solution of EDE, ﬁve dilutions of the extract wereprepared at 50 –800μg/mL and used to carry out the assay. Eachpeptide solution was then incubated with exposure groups in 0.25 mLglass inserts (Sun Sri, Rockwood, TN, USA) to make up a ﬁnal reactionvolume of 100 μL( 5μL sample, 20 μL acetonitrile and 75 μL cysteinepeptide or 25 μL sample and 75 μL lysine peptide). Thus, cysteine andlysine peptide solutions were incubated with the exposure groups at1:15 (v/v) and 1:3 (v/v) ratios, respectively. In the ﬁnal reactionvolumes, both peptides found at 0.5 mM.After the incubation period in the dark for 24 h at 25 °C, the freepeptide of each sample was quanti ﬁed using the same chromatographeras that described in Section 2.3 . The samples and calibration standardsof each peptide (0.0167 –0.534 mM) were analyzed in triplicate for eachpeptide. The temperatures of the autosampler and column were 25 and
30 °C, respectively, and the injection volume was 10 μL. The mobilephase consisted of 0.1% (v/v) tri ﬂuoroacetic acid in ultrapure water (A)and 0.085% (v/v) tri ﬂuoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (B), both at0.35 mL/min. The chromatograms were extracted at 220 nm.The mean peptide depletion (%) was obtained according to thefollowing equation: depletion (%) = [1 –(peptide peak area of testchemical / peptide peak area of control)] × 100. A value ≤6.38% wasconsidered a negative result (no or minimal reactivity class). Thepositive results (depletion ≥6.38%) were classi ﬁed according to thefollowing reactivity classes: low (6.38% < depletion ≤22.62%), mod-erate (22.62% < depletion ≤42.47%) and high (42.47% < deple-tion≤100%).2.9.2. HaCaT keratinocytes-associated IL-18 assayAn analysis of intracellular IL-18 production by HaCaT keratino-cytes was carried out, based on the protocol described by Corsini et al.(2013) . First, the MTT assay was undertaken to determine the non-
cytotoxic concentrations of EDE that maintain cell viability ≥80%(CV80). Brie ﬂy, the cells (1.5 × 105cells/mL) were seeded into 96-wellplates and incubated overnight. After that, they were exposed to eightdiﬀerent concentrations of EDE (6.25 –400μg/mL), DMSO as vehiclecontrol (0.1%) or culture medium only (control cells) for 24 h. Theplates were then washed twice with PBS (100 μL/well) and cell viabilitywas assessed by MTT assay, as in Section 2.7 .In the evaluation of IL-18 production, HaCaT cells (1.5 × 105cells/mL) were seeded into a 24-well ﬂat plate and incubated overnight. Afterthat, the cells were exposed to culture medium only (untreated cells),non-cytotoxic concentrations of EDE (40, 80 or 160 μg/mL), DNCB(2μg/mL) as positive control or vehicle control (0.1% DMSO) for 24 h.Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with PBS (1 mL/well) andcell lysates were obtained using 250 μL of PBS solution containing 0.5%
(v/v) Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail. The samples werestored at −80 °C to await analysis. Quanti ﬁcation of IL-18 levels wasconducted using the Quantikine ®ELISA human IL-18 BPa kit (R & DSystems) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, while theprotein content of the cell lysates was measured by bicinchoninic acidprotein assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich) using bovine serum albumin asstandard. The IL-18 levels (pg) are expressed based on total intracel-lular protein content (mg) and the stimulation index (SI) was calculatedas follows: SI = IL-18 in chemical-treated cells/IL-18 in vehicle-treatedcells. A result was considered positive when SI ≥1.2 and with asigniﬁcant increase in IL-18 in comparison to vehicle treated cells.2.9.3. Myeloid U937 skin sensitization test (MUSST) and IL-8 productionanalysisMUSST was conducted based on the protocol described elsewhere(Piroird et al., 2015 ). In brief, the ﬁrst step was an evaluation of the
cytotoxicity of EDE in U937 cells to determine the extract concentra-
(Piroird et al., 2015 ). In brief, the ﬁrst step was an evaluation of thecytotoxicity of EDE in U937 cells to determine the extract concentra-tions which promote viability ≥80%. Thus, 100 μL of cell suspension(0.5 × 106cels/mL) were plated into 96-well plates and 100 μL of eightconcentrations of EDE (3.12– 400μg/mL) or vehicle (DMSO at 0.2%)were added and incubated for 45 h. The cells were then washed twicewith ice cold-PBS and cell viability was determined by propidiumiodide (PI) (3 μg/mL) staining. The second step carried out was anevaluation of CD86 expression in U937 cells after exposure to ﬁvediﬀerent concentrations of EDE (12.5 –200μg/mL), vehicle or DNCB(1μg/mL) as positive control for 45 h. Brie ﬂy, after the incubationperiod, the cell supernatant of each well was stored at −80 °C to awaitIL-8 secretion analysis using BD OptEIA ™human IL-8 ELISA set kit (BDBiosciences), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, while
the cells were used to analyze CD86 expression. The cells were washedwith 500 μL of ice-cold bu ﬀer (PBS + 5% FBS, v/v) and centrifuged at1000 rpm, at 4 °C for 5 min. After that, they were incubated with100μL of staining solution containing bu ﬀer (95 μL) and FITC-con-jugated anti-human CD86 monoclonal antibody or FITC-isotype controlIgG1. After 30 min of incubation at 4 °C, the cells were washed oncewith ice-cold bu ﬀer and PBS. 100 μLo fP I( 3 μg/mL) solution was thenadded and the cells analyzed by ﬂow cytometer (BD FACSCanto II,Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) recording 10,000 events. Dead cells (PI+) were excluded from the CD86 expression analysis. Data werecalculated as stimulation index (SI) according to the following equa-tion: SI = [(%CD86treated−% isotype IgG1 treated ) / (%CD86 control−%isotype IgG1 control )] × 100. In parallel, positive control (DNCB at 1 μg/mL) and vehicle (DMSO at 0.1%) groups were analyzed. A positive
response for skin sensitization was considered when SI ≥150.2.10. Eye irritation evaluation2.10.1. Bovine corneal opacity and permeability (BCOP) assayThe BCOP assay was carried out according to OECD test guidelineN° 437 ( OECD, 2013). Bovine eyes of freshly slaughtered animals wereobtained as a residual product from a local abattoir (Vale do Cedro,Inhumas, GO, Brazil). Corneas with no corneal damage or abnormalitieswere removed, mounted in holders, and the chambers were ﬁlled withpre-warmed EMEM (without phenol red). After incubation of 1 h at32 °C in an air incubator (Nova Ética, São Paulo, SP, Brazil), EMEM(without phenol red) was removed and replaced. The opacity of eachcornea was then determined using an opacitometer (OP-KIT ElectroDesing, Riom, France) and those with opacity > 7 were discarded.After that, the corneas ( n= 3/group) were exposed to 750 μL of PBS
(corneal control), benzalkonium chloride (5%, p/v) (positive control),EDE (0.1%, p/v) or its vehicle (DMSO at 2.5%) for 10 min. The anteriorchamber of each holder was then washed at least three times withEMEM containing phenol red, once with EMEM without phenol red andreﬁlled with this EMEM, followed by an additional incubation of 2 h.Subsequently, the EMEM of the two chambers was replaced and opacitywas measured again. The values of the three corneas in each exposuregroup were used to obtain mean corneal opacity. After that, the EMEMof the anterior chamber was removed, 1 mL of ﬂuorescein solution(4 mg/mL) was added and the holders were incubated in a horizontalposition for 90 min at 32 °C. After incubation, 200 μL from eachposterior chamber were placed in a 96-well bottom plate and absor-bance was determined at 490 nm. The in vitro irritancy score (IVIS) wascalculated according to the following equation: IVIS = mean opacity
value + (15 × mean permeability value). Based on the IVIS value, theexposure groups were classi ﬁed as no category (IVIS ≤3), no predictioncan be made (3 < IVIS ≤55), or category 1 (corrosive or severe
exposure groups were classi ﬁed as no category (IVIS ≤3), no predictioncan be made (3 < IVIS ≤55), or category 1 (corrosive or severeirritant) (IVIS > 55), according to the United Nations Globally Harmo-nized System of Classi ﬁcation and Labelling of Chemicals (UN GHS).2.10.2. Corneal histomorphometric examinationThe histomorphometric analysis was carried out in accordance withOliveira et al. (2015) . In brief, the corneas of each exposure group werekept in 10% phosphate bu ﬀered formalin (pH 7.4) at room temperatureuntil processing. Then, two sagittal macroscopic cross sections of thecorneas were obtained, dehydrated in graded ethanol (70, 95 and 100%for 30 min in each solution) and cleared in xylene (30 min). Subse-L.C.

quently, the samples were para ﬃn-embedded in an automatic tissueprocessor (DM60, OMA, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) and corneal sections(5μm thickness) were obtained using a microtome (Leica RM 2155,Heidelberg, BW, Germany). After mounting, the slides were dewaxed inxylene, hydrated using graded ethanol and stained with hematoxylinand eosin (H & E). The images were obtained using a light microscope(Axio Scope A1 Carl Zeiss, Jena, TH, Germany), in 10× or 20×objectives, coupled with an AxioCamMRc Carl Zeiss camera andanalyzed in AxioVs40 V 4.7.2.0 Carl Zeis software. A histomorpho-metric evaluation was carried out by measuring the thickness of theepithelium and stroma in about 10 locations.2.11. Genotoxicity evaluation by cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay(MNvit test-cytoB)The MNvit test-cytoB was carried out according to the OECD testguideline N° 487 ( OECD, 2014) with the slight modi ﬁcations proposedbyÁvila et al. (2017a) . First, non-cytotoxic concentrations of EDE were
determined by MTT assay (data not shown), as described in Section 2.7 .For the MNvit test-cytoB, the cells (1 × 105cells/mL) were seeded intotissue culture ﬂasks (25 cm2) and incubated overnight. They were thenexposed to di ﬀerent concentrations of EDE (25, 50 or 100 μg/mL) orDMSO (0.1%) as negative control for 24 h. In parallel, the cells werealso exposed to clastogenic (cyclophosphamide at 200 μg/mL) oraneugenic (colchicine at 0.01 μg/mL) positive controls for 4 h. Afterthe incubation period, the cells were washed once with PBS (5 mL/ﬂask) and incubated with complete culture medium containing cyto-chalasin-B (3 μg/mL) for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were removedfrom the ﬂasks using trypsin (0.025%)/EDTA (0.02%) solution, trans-ferred to a tube, centrifuged (at 1500 rpm for 5 min) and treated withice-cold tri-sodium citrate dihydrate (1%, p/v) solution for 5 min, afterwhich formaldehyde (20 μL) was added. After centrifugation, the cells
were resuspended with 5 mL of methanol/acetic acid (3:1) solution andcentrifuged again. Then they were resuspended with the same solution(500 μL). The slides were mounted, stained using acridine orangediluted in PBS (40 μg/mL) and analyzed by ﬂuorescence microscopy(DMI 4000B Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL, USA) in a 40×objective. The micronucleus frequency of each exposure group wasdetermined in a total of 1000 binucleated cells. In addition, mono-nucleate, binucleate or multinucleate cells were scored in a total of 500cells and the cytokinesis-block proliferation index (CBPI) obtainedusing the following equation: CBPI = [No. mononucleate cells]+ [2 × No. binucleate cells] + [3 × multinucleate cells] / total num-ber of cells.2.12. Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism 5 softwareversion 5.0 for Windows 98 (San Diego, CA, USA). Results are expressedas mean or mean ± SD of three independent assays. The inter group
variation was measured by one- or two-way Analysis of Variance(ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's or Bonferroni's multiple comparisontests, respectively. Statistical signi ﬁcance was established as p< 0.05.3. Results3.1. HPLC analysis of the complex botanical mixture, EDEThe complex botanical mixture, EDE, was analyzed by HPLCthrough comparing the retention times of the phytochemicals to thoseof their reference standards. The possible main components identi ﬁedare shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen, the chromatogram showed thepresence of the tannin (ellagic acid) and ﬂavonoids (quercetin andgallic acid).3.2. EDE mixture inhibits collagenase, elastase and tyrosinase activitiesThe evaluation of direct enzyme inhibition, in which collagenase,elastase and tyrosinase were exposed to di ﬀerent concentrations of EDE(5–100μg/mL) showed that the mixture promoted considerable inhibi-tion of these enzymes ( Fig. 2 ). The EDE was capable of inhibiting 45%
of elastase activity at a concentration of 100 μg/mL, and 25% of the
tion of these enzymes ( Fig. 2 ). The EDE was capable of inhibiting 45%of elastase activity at a concentration of 100 μg/mL, and 25% of thecollagenase and tyrosinase activities at the same concentration. Asregards collagenase and tyrosinase inhibition at lower concentrations ofEDE (5, 25, 50 or 75 μg/mL), a mean inhibitory e ﬀect of 7.34 and16.74% was seen for collagenase and tyrosinase, respectively. Noelastase inhibitory e ﬀect was determined by EDE in the lowestconcentration tested (5 μg/mL). However, inhibitory activity increasedin a concentration-dependent manner at 25 –100μg/mL.3.3.Evaluation of SPF of EDEAs presented in Fig. 3A, the spectrophotometric scanning of the EDEmixture showed an absorption pro ﬁle between 260 and 290 nm. Inaddition, emulsions containing EDE (0.1%, 0.5% or 1%) or OMC (3.7 or7.35%), were investigated. As expected, emulsions containing OMC, anorganic sunscreen agent, showed maximum absorption peaks near
310 nm at 3.7 and 7.35% with SPF values of 6.94 and 13.75,respectively, while EDE emulsions did not absorb at the same range,which suggests that EDE, by this assay, does not provide sun protectionin the UVB range ( Fig. 3 B).3.4. EDE mixture promotes cell photoprotection and regeneration in HFF-1ﬁbroblastsThe eﬀects of cell photoprotection and regeneration promoted byEDE (10 –300μg/mL) were evaluated using HFF-1 ﬁbroblasts. In bothassays, the EDE was not cytotoxic to cells non-irradiated cells (UVA −),in comparison to non-irradiated control cells (control UVA −). On theother hand, UVA+ exposure was signi ﬁcantly cytotoxic (controlUVA+) ( p< 0.001), when compared to the non-irradiated controlcells (control UVA −)(Figs. 4 A and B).In the photoprotection analysis ( Fig. 4A), HFF-1 ﬁbroblasts werepretreated with the concentrations of 10– 300μg/mL EDE mixture, for2 h before UVA exposure. It was veri ﬁed that cell viability was
signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05) reduced to 70.73, 48.90 and 32.20% for200, 250 and 300 μg/mL EDE, respectively. Thus, it suggested thatEDE became phototoxic at these higher concentrations.In terms of cell regeneration analysis ( Fig. 4 B), treatment of the cellswith the EDE mixture (70 –300μg/mL) after UVA exposure promotedregeneration of HFF-1 ﬁbroblasts and maintained cell viability > 99%.However, no EDE-induced regenerative e ﬀect was seen at low concen-trations (10 and 40 μg/mL). At these concentrations, cell viability wassigniﬁcantly reduced ( p< 0.001) from 92.33 to 64.55% and from97.97 to 70.45% at 10 and 40 μg/mL of EDE, respectively. Furthermore,the EDE vehicle (DMSO, 0.1%) did not lead to a reduction in cellviability in any of the assays performed (data not shown).3.5. EDE mixture has no phototoxic potential, according to the 3T3 NRUphototoxicity testAs shown in Table 1 ,amiodarone HCL was performed as a positive
amiodarone HCL was performed as a positivecontrol and was successfully classi ﬁed as a phototoxic agent, showingIC50values of 54.50 ± 1.15 μg/mL (UVA − exposure) and5.51 ± 3.02 μg/mL (UVA+ exposure), PIF and MPE of 9.89 and 0.4,respectively. In the same conditions, EDE showed IC 50values of31.01 ± 7.97 and 22.60 ± 2.48 μg/mL under UVA −and UVA+exposures, PIF and MPE of 1.37 and 0.09, respectively. Thus, EDE wasclassiﬁed as a non-phototoxic mixture.L.C. Moreira et al. Toxicology in Vitro 45 (2017) 397–408401
3.6. EDE shows no skin sensitization potential using a two-out-of-threeprediction model3.6.1. mDPRAThe cysteine- and lysine-containing peptide depletion data areshown in Table 2. DNCB positive control showed high depletion forboth peptides and obtained a mean depletion of 77.5%, which allowedit to be correctly classi ﬁed as a skin sensitizer in the high reactivityclass. It is worth mentioning that depletion triggered by EDE wasespecially marked for cysteine peptide, in a dependent-concentrationmanner. Mean peptide depletion was 28.72 –57.68%, which classi ﬁes itin the moderate-high reactivity class. Thus, EDE showed potential skinsensitization in this ﬁrst parameter of skin sensitization assessment.3.6.2. HaCaT keratinocytes-associated IL-18 assayIn HaCaT keratinocytes, EDE promoted a reduction in cell viabilityat high concentrations (200 and 400 μg/mL) after 24 h exposure,obtaining a CV80value of 160 μg/mL. Using concentrations of
80value of 160 μg/mL. Using concentrations of6.25 –100μg/mL, it induced an increase in HaCaT proliferation(Fig. 5 A). Vehicle (DMSO at 0.1%) showed cell viability similar to thatof control cells (data not shown). Thus, IL-18 levels were quanti ﬁed inFig. 1. HPLC chromatograms of the complex botanical mixture, EDE. A1 represents gallic acid (3.97 min) and ellagic acid (18.01 min) detected at 280 nm, whereas A4 representsquercetin (17.5 min) at 254 nm found in EDE. Reference standards are shown in A2-A5: gallic acid (A2), ellagic acid (A3) and quercetin (A5).Fig. 2.

HaCaT keratinocytes exposed to three non-cytotoxic concentrations ofEDE (40, 80 and 160 μg/mL), which maintained cell viability ≥80%.DNCB promoted a signi ﬁcant increase of 416.05 pg/mg in the IL-18levels ( p< 0.01), in comparison with vehicle (261.11 pg/mg) andcontrol (272.33 pg/mg). In contrast, EDE concentrations did not lead toan increase in IL-18 production in HaCaT cells. The SI values obtainedwere 1.53 for DNCB and 0.56, 0.62 and 0.52 for 40, 80 and 160 μg/mLof EDE, respectively. Therefore, EDE showed no skin sensitizer potentialfor this endpoint.3.6.3. MUSST and IL-8 level analysisIn the cytotoxicity analysis using PI staining, U937 cells exposed todiﬀerent concentrations of EDE (1.56 –200μg/mL) showed cell viabili-ty > 85% ( Fig. 6A). Cells exposed to the vehicle showed cell viabilitysimilar to that of the control (data not shown). The cells were thenexposed to non-cytotoxic concentrations of EDE (12.5 –200μg/mL) or
DNCB positive control to evaluate CD86 expression. In this analysis, apositive response for skin sensitization is considered when SI ≥150.Thus, as expected, DNCB presented an increase in CD86 expression,showing an SI value of 169.0 ( Fig. 6B). In addition, DNCB triggered asigniﬁcant secretion of 538.09 pg/mL of IL-8 ( p< 0.0001), whencompared to control (89.34 pg/mL) or vehicle (103.72 pg/mL)(Fig. 6C). On the other hand, EDE showed similar values to the controlgroup for both parameters ( Figs. 6B and C). Therefore, EDE wasclassiﬁed as non-sensitizer for this endpoint.3.7. EDE mixture has no eye irritation potentialIn the BCOP assay, the mean IVIS values obtained were 0.354, 1.65,92.68 and 0.27 for PBS (corneal control), vehicle (DMSO at 2.5%),benzalkonium chloride (5%) positive control and EDE (1 mg/mL),respectively. Thus, benzalkonium chloride was correctly classi ﬁed asinducing serious eye damage (UN GHS category 1), whereas EDE was

After 24 h of incubation, cell viability wasevaluated by MTT assay.

classiﬁed as “no category ”in UN GHS since its IVIS value was ≤3.Corroborating these ﬁndings, a corneal histomorphometric exam-ination showed that benzalkonium chloride led to a signi ﬁcant decreaseof 51.09 μm in epithelium length ( p< 0.0001) along with an increaseof 555.83 μm in stroma length ( p< 0.0001), when compared tocontrol which presented values of 90.38 and 440.24 μm, respectively(Figs. 7A and B). In Fig. 8, the representative histopathological imageshows the damage done by benzalkonium chloride in contrast to thenormal histomorphology of the control. On the other hand, EDE and itsvehicle did not show any damage in these corneal histomorphometricparameters ( Figs. 7A and B). However, slight and reversible hydropicdegeneration occurred in the basal epithelial layer of corneas exposedto EDE ( Fig. 8).3.8. EDE mixture has no genotoxic potential using MNvit test-cytoBTable 3 summarizes the MNvit test-cytoB data using HepG2 cells. As
expected, cyclophosphamide (200 μg/mL) and colchicine (0.01 μg/mL)signiﬁcantly promoted an increase in micronucleated cells(p< 0.0001), in comparison to control. On the other hand, the EDE(25–100μg/mL) did not induce a signi ﬁcant increase in MN frequencyin any of the concentrations tested. CBPI values were determined toanalyze cell toxicity and delays in cell division rates but no signi ﬁcantchanges were seen when compared to control.4. DiscussionIt has been reported that botanical mixture extracts containing highlevels of polyphenols with antioxidant properties are consideredpromising active ingredients for cosmetic formulations ( Bowe, 2013;Zillich et al., 2015 ). Due to the presence of these phytochemicals, greentea ( Camellia sinensis ) leaves and chamomile ( Matricaria chamomilla )ﬂower extracts are among the natural products commonly found incommercial skin products ( Andres et al., 2013). Several botanical
preparations from Brazilian tropical ﬂora, such as the babaçu coconut(Orbignya martiana ), Brazil nut ( Berthollethia excelsa ) and pequi (Car-yocar brasilienses )(Pereira, 2009 ), have also been used. Like theseﬁndings, our previous studies have showed that EDE is a polyphenol-rich complex botanical mixture, containing, in particular, ﬂavonoidsand tannins with marked free-radical scavenging activities and alsochemoprotective properties ( Ávila et al., 2016; Couto et al., 2009). Inthis study, it was shown that the ellagic acid, quercetin and gallic acidare some of the possible phytochemicals present in the EDE, which canexplain, at least in part, the biological e ﬀects promoted by the EDEmixture. Infante et al. (2016) showed that extracts from the leaves andfruits of four unexplored Brazilian native plants ( E. leitonii ,E. involu-crata, E. brasiliensis and E. myrcianthes), all belonging to the Myrtaceaefamily like EDE, contain epicatechin and gallic acid as their major
phytochemicals, which contribute to their antioxidant and anti-in ﬂam-matory activities.It is known that the solar UV rays that reach the Earth's surface areconsidered responsible for human skin-related disorders, due to DNAdamage, such as sunburn, premature skin aging and skin cancer(Choquenet et al., 2008; D'Orazio et al., 2013; Marionnet et al., 2015;Naylor et al., 2011 ). In this context, polyphenolic plant constituents,such as quercetin, have been highlighted as potential sunscreen agentsTable 2Results obtained in the mDPRA.GroupaCys-peptide depletion (%) Lys-peptide depletion (%) Mean depletion (%) Prediction modelbReactivity classDNCB (5 mM/25 mM) 99.33 ± 1.15 55.67 ± 9.71 77.50 + HighEDE (2.5 μg/mL/12.5 μg/mL) 55.96 ± 6.27 1.48 ± 2.57 28.72 + ModerateEDE (5 μg/mL/25 μg/mL) 65.64 ± 7.52 0 32.82 + ModerateEDE (10 μg/mL/50 μg/mL) 99.06 ± 0.82 2.41 ± 4.17 50.73 + HighEDE (20 μg/mL/100 μg/mL) 99.59 ± 0.72 12.12 ± 5.16 55.86 + High

because of their ability to absorb both types of UV rays, namely UVAand UVB. Reports have showed that NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2)pathway has an important role in keratinocyte protection by ellagicacid and quercetin against UVA-induced oxidative stress ( Hseu et al.,2012; Kimura et al., 2009 ). Moreover, polyphenols could exert anti-inﬂammatory and immunomodulatory e ﬀects, thereby reducing oxida-tive stress and protecting the skin against UV damage through themodulation of multiple signaling pathways, such as mitogen-activatedprotein kinases (MAPK) and nuclear transcription factors of nuclearfactor-kappa B (NF- κB) (Nichols and Katiyar, 2010). Although the EDEmixture has a high level of polyphenol in its composition, it was notshown to have a UVB ﬁlter pro ﬁle. In addition, our data showed thatthe pretreatment of HFF-1 ﬁbroblasts with higher concentrations ofEDE (200 –300μg/mL), for 2 h before UVA exposure, was able to reduce
cell viability, suggesting that EDE became phototoxic at these higherconcentrations. However, treatment of the HFF-1 cells with EDE(70–300μg/mL) after UVA exposure promoted cell regeneration, whichhighlights the protective role of this botanical mixture.Corroborating these ﬁndings, several reports have shown the skinphotoprotection potential and properties of natural products ( Afaq andKatiyar, 2011; Nichols and Katiyar, 2010; Saewan and Jimtaisong,2015; Sera ﬁni et al., 2015 ). Recently, bark ( Aniba canelilla ,Brosimumacutifolium ,Dalbergia monetaria and Aspidosperma nitidum ), leaf ( Arra-bidaea chica ) andﬂower ( Caesalpinia pyramidalis ) extracts of plants fromthe Brazilian Amazon biome have shown promising antioxidant andphotoprotective activities ( Martins et al., 2016 ), which corroborate theuse of these botanical mixtures in anti-aging cosmetic formulations.These data are in accordance with our ﬁndings on EDE, which led to
considerable inhibition of collagenase and elastase, two enzymesinvolved in the skin aging process ( Ganceviciene et al., 2012; Seoet al., 2009 ). Considering that collagen and elastin ﬁbers are the targetsof these enzymes, many treatments and cosmetic products have beendeveloped to act on the inhibition of these enzymes and restore theﬁber network ( Mukherjee et al., 2011). Some of these products aremade up of natural products, such as soybean ( Waqas et al., 2014) andbarley grain ( Maliar et al., 2015 ) extracts. In parallel, the EDE alsopromoted the inhibition of tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in melaninbiosynthesis. Souza et al. (2012a) evaluated the in vitro tyrosinaseinhibitory activity of extracts from 13 Brazilian Cerrado plant species.Of these, Pouteria torta and E. dysenterica leaf extracts showed thehighest potential for skin-whitening and antimelanogenesis. Pedrosaet al. (2016) have demonstrated the anti-whitening and anti-wrinkle
eﬀects of the jucá(Libidibia ferrea Mart.), a tree native to Brazil's northand northeast. Their ﬁndings involved the inhibition of elastase,collagenase, hyaluronidase and tyrosinase activities, as well as con-siderable antioxidant activity associated with the presence of poly-phenols (e.g. ellagic acid, kaempferol, catechin and epicatechin) in jucátrunk bark and pod extracts. Regarding ellagic acid, a phytochemicalFig. 6. Eﬀects of EDE on CD86 expression and IL-8 levels by U937 cells. (A) The cells (0.5 × 106cels/mL) were exposed to eight di ﬀerent concentrations of EDE (1.56 –200μg/mL) for45 h and cell viability was evaluated by propidium iodide (PI) (3 μg/mL) staining. (B) In MUSST and (C) IL-8 analysis, the cells were exposed to ﬁve diﬀerent concentrations of EDE(12.5 –200μg/mL) for 45 h and then CD86 expression and IL-8 secretion were determined.

present in EDE, Ortiz-Ruiz et al. (2016) showed that it is an alternativesubstrate of tyrosinase and partly inhibits the melanogenesis due to itspotential antioxidant e ﬀect, which can partly explain the e ﬀects of EDEagainst tyrosinase activity.Toxicologically speaking, while botanical ingredients are not free oftoxicity, these skincare materials are usually well-tolerated ( Mukherjeeet al., 2011 ). On the other hand, lightening agents and other activeingredients in synthetic skincare products (e.g. monoethanolamine,sodium laureth sulfate, hydroquinone, kojic acid and corticosteroids)commonly trigger signi ﬁcant adverse reactions, including allergiccontact dermatitis, skin irritation and phototoxic reactions ( Chiariet al., 2011; Mukherjee et al., 2011 ). In this sense, safety evaluationis mandatory for all types of products, including botanical extract-basedcosmetics.In our ﬁrst toxicological evaluation, EDE was classi ﬁed as non-
phototoxic using the 3T3 NRU phototoxicity assay. In the regulatorycontext, this safety data is crucial for sunlight-exposed skin productssince their ingredients can absorb photons from solar rays and triggerhazardous damage to the skin biological system ( Hans et al., 2008 ). Inaddition, the EDE did not show eye irritation potential, according to theBCOP assay in conjunction with corneal histomorphometric analysis,although slight but reversible hydropic degeneration occurred in thebasal epithelial layer of corneas exposed to the extract. Reversiblehydropic degeneration events have already been reported in mice livertissues ( Ávila et al., 2016; Lima et al., 2011 ) in intensity higher thanthat observed in corneas, probably due to an extensive framework ofxenobiotic metabolizing enzymes found in the liver.Furthermore, the skin sensitization prediction for EDE was under-taken with integrated testing strategies (ITS) involving di ﬀerent key-
steps of the allergic contact dermatitis process: (1) protein-binding/haptenization, (2) keratinocyte and (3) dendritic cell activations. Theapplication of the two-out-of-three prediction model showed that EDEhas no skin sensitization potential. Prediction platforms, based on threekey-steps mentioned above, have been applied to determine the skinsensitization potential of chemicals with acceptable accuracy withoutusing animal models ( Bauch et al., 2012; Natsch et al., 2013; Urbischet al., 2015 ). In this regard, in a ﬁrst step, the EDE was predicted as askin sensitizer using mDPRA. Moreover, we observed that EDE mixturehas preferential reactivity to cysteine-containing peptides. Lalko et al.(2012) showed that skin sensitizers seem to react preferentially withcysteine rather than with lysine peptides. Findings have demonstratedthat EDE is rich in tannins ( Ávila et al., 2016; Couto et al., 2009). These
phytochemicals are well known for their ability to establish tannin-protein complexes by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions(Hagerman, 1989), which could a ﬀect, at least in part, the analyticaldetection of the peptide depletion triggered by EDE. However, thepositive result found in mDPRA was not decisive on the weight-of-evidence using the ITS approach, since the EDE mixture was classi ﬁedas a non-sensitizer using cell-based assays (MUSST and HaCaT-asso-ciated IL-18 assay).Considering that genotoxic evaluation is an essential parameter forcosmetic ingredients ( Di Sotto et al., 2014 ), the MNvit test-cytoB usingthe HepG2 cell line was carried out. The result showed that the EDE wasunable to promote a signi ﬁcant increase in micronuclei frequency underthe conditions tested. Although gene mutation was not evaluated hereusing, for example, Bacterial Reverse Mutation Test as recommended byScienti ﬁc Committee on Consumer Safety ( SCCS, 2015 ), our ﬁndingssuggest
suggestthat EDE can be a botanical mixture without genotoxicpotential, since it did not promote structural (clastogenicity) and
Scienti ﬁc Committee on Consumer Safety ( SCCS, 2015 ), our ﬁndingssuggestthat EDE can be a botanical mixture without genotoxicpotential, since it did not promote structural (clastogenicity) andnumerical (aneugenicity) chromosome aberrations. Corroborating this,quercetin, a ﬂavonoid present in EDE, has presented protective e ﬀectsagainst oxidative stress induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide in HepG2cells ( Alía et al., 2006). Similarly, Vieira et al. (2012) showed that E.Fig. 8. Corneal histopathology analysis of EDE in BCOP assay.

dysenterica leaf extract has protective e ﬀects against cyclophosphamide-induced genotoxicity in mice. In addition, the extract of gabiroba(Campomanesia cambessedeana ), a Brazilian Cerrado fruit of the Myrta-ceae family like EDE, has showed antigenotoxic and antimutagenicproperties ( Malta et al., 2012 ).Gabiroba extract has also been high-lighted as a protective agent against carbon tetrachloride-inducedtoxicity in HepG2 cells ( Fernandes et al., 2015).In conclusion, the EDE botanical mixture showed marked cellregenerative e ﬀects against UVA exposure-induced damage, and con-siderable inhibitory activity of skin enzymes related to dermatologicaland/or esthetic disorders. These biological activities were associated, atleast in part, with the presence of antioxidant phytochemicals, inparticular, ellagic acid, quercetin and gallic acid. Moreover, EDE seemsto be well-tolerated topically, without any relevant toxic e ﬀects. When
all this is considered, these ﬁndings support the potential use of the EDEbotanical mixture in cosmetic/pharmaceutical products.Declaration of interestThe authors declare no con ﬂict of interest.AcknowledgementsThis study was supported by Fundação de Apoio à Pesquisa(FUNAPE) at the Federal University of Goiás, Fundação de Apoio àPesquisa do Estado de Goiás (FAPEG), Conselho Nacional deDesenvolvimento Cientí ﬁco e Tecnológico (CNPq), Financiadora deEstudos e Projetos (FINEP), and Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento dePessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES).ReferencesAfaq, F., Katiyar, S.K., 2011.
