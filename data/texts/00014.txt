Here, we employ high-resolutiondensity gradient fractionation and direct immunoaf-ﬁnity capture to precisely characterize the RNA,DNA, and protein constituents of exosomes and othernon-vesicle material. Extracellular RNA, RNA-binding
proteins, and other cellular proteins are differentiallyexpressed in exosomes and non-vesicle compart-ments. Argonaute 1–4, glycolytic enzymes, and cyto-skeletal proteins were not detected in exosomes.We identify annexin A1 as a speciﬁc marker for micro-vesicles that are shed directly from the plasma mem-brane. We further show that small extracellular vesi-cles are not vehicles of active DNA release. Instead,we propose a new model for active secretion ofextracellular DNA through an autophagy- and multi-vesicular-endosome-dependent but exosome-inde-pendent mechanism. This study demonstrates theneed for a reassessment of exosome compositionand offers a framework for a clearer understandingof extracellular vesicle heterogeneity.INTRODUCTIONCells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) of different sizes andintracellular origin. The heterogeneity of EVs and presence ofnon-vesicular extracellular nanoparticles pose major obstacles
to our understanding of the composition and functional proper-ties of distinct secreted components. Greater precision inassigning RNA, DNA, and protein to their correct extracellularcompartments and identifying their mechanisms of secretion iscrucial for identiﬁcation of biomarkers and design of future druginterventions. Exosomes are 40–150 nm, endosome-derived,small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) secreted by most, if not all,cells. RNA (including mRNA, microRNA [miRNA], and othernon-coding RNA), DNA, and lipids are reported to be activelyand selectively incorporated into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs),which reside within multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) and arethe precursor of exosomes ( van Niel et al., 2018 ). In addition toaccounting for the presence of membrane proteins in exosomes,inward budding of endosomal membranes is thought to result in
the engulfment of cytosolic proteins and other components to thelumen of ILVs ( Mathieu et al., 2019; van Niel et al., 2018 ). Fusion ofMVEs with the plasma membrane then releases ILVs into theextracellular space as exosomes. In contrast, microvesicles are150–1,000 nm large extracellular vesicles (lEVs) generated byshedding from the plasma membrane ( Mathieu et al., 2019; vanNiel et al., 2018 ). However, speciﬁc markers that distinguish mi-crovesicles from exosomes are lacking.
shedding from the plasma membrane ( Mathieu et al., 2019; vanNiel et al., 2018 ). However, speciﬁc markers that distinguish mi-crovesicles from exosomes are lacking.Much of the recent interest in EVs was triggered by the discov-ery that exosomes function in the transport of secreted extracel-lular RNA (exRNA), including extracellular miRNA and mRNAtransport ( Skog et al., 2008; Valadi et al., 2007 ). Argonautes(Agos) are important miRNA-processing proteins, but the exo-some-mediated secretion of human Ago proteins is an unsettledissue ( Arroyo et al., 2011; Melo et al., 2014; Shurtleff et al., 2016 ).Other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have also been reported tobe present in exosomes with possible roles for sorting of RNA(Mateescu et al., 2017; Shurtleff et al., 2016; Villarroya-Beltriet al., 2013 ). However, the heterogeneity of extracellular vesiclesand nanoparticles, as well as differences in puriﬁcation strate-gies, have confounded analyses.
Here, we employ high-resolution density gradient fractionationto separate sEVs from non-vesicular material, and direct immu-noafﬁnity capture (DIC) to speciﬁcally isolate exosomes fromother types of sEVs. DIC was performed without ultracentrifuga-tion and using capture beads targeting classical exosomaltetraspanins. Comprehensive proteomic and nucleic acid anal-ysis revealed that exRNA and proteins are differentially ex-pressed between sEVs and non-vesicle compartments. ManyRBPs linked to inclusion or loading of exRNA in exosomes,including Ago1–4, are not associated with classical exosomes428 Cell 177, 428–445, April 4, 2019 ª2019 Elsevier Inc.

displaying the exosomal markers CD63, CD81, and CD9 ( Kowalet al., 2016; van Niel et al., 2018 ). Exosomes lack cytoskeletal el-ements and common glycolytic enzymes; the absence of thesehighly abundant cytosolic proteins suggests that exosomeloading must be a highly regulated process. These studieswere performed using human colon (DKO-1) and glioblastoma(Gli36) cancer cell lines. The major ﬁndings were validated innormal human kidney epithelial cells and human plasma. Exo-somes are touted to be vehicles of extracellular DNA secretion,making them attractive targets as liquid biopsies for cancerpatients. We provide evidence that double-stranded DNA(dsDNA) and DNA-binding histones are not carried by exosomesor any other type of sEV. Instead, we show that active secretionof extracellular dsDNA and histones can occur through anautophagy- and MVE-dependent, exosome-independent mech-anism. Additionally, we identify annexin A1 as a speciﬁc marker
for classical microvesicles budding from the plasma mem-brane. These ﬁndings clarify exosomal constituents and providesounder footing for exploring their functional properties.RESULTSHigh-Resolution Density Gradient FractionationSeparates Small Extracellular Vesicles from Non-vesicular ComponentsIt is increasingly clear that ‘‘exosomal’’ samples contain a het-erogeneous mixture of sEVs and non-vesicular compartments(operational deﬁnitions in Figure 1 A and Table S1 ). Crude lEVs(P15) and crude sEVs (P120) were prepared from DKO-1 andGli36 cells using conventional differential centrifugation ( STARMethods ). These P120 preparations were highly enriched forthe classical exosome markers CD63, CD81, and CD9 anddevoid of gross contamination ( Figure 1 B). To further separatethe membrane-enclosed sEVs from non-vesicular (NV) compo-nents, we employed high-resolution iodixanol gradients ( STARMethods ). CD63 and CD81 were present in low-density fractions
distinct from those containing the extracellular matrix proteinﬁbronectin and the ribosomal protein RPS3 ( Figures 1 C andS1A–S1C). Based on the presence of these exosomal markers,low-density fraction pools of puriﬁed sEVs and high-densitypools of NV components were identiﬁed ( Figures 1 C,S1B, andS1C). Subjecting the puriﬁed sEVs to a second round of densityfractionation did not cause a reappearance of GAPDH andEEF1A1 in high-density fractions, indicating that componentsin the NV fractions are unlikely to arise de novo from damageto vesicles ( Figure S1 D). Only the low-density pool containingthe gradient-puriﬁed sEVs was highly susceptible to detergent-mediated disruption ( Figure 1 D). The low-density pooled frac-tions contained cup-shaped vesicles of size and morphologyconsistent with sEVs-exosomes while these were absent fromhigh-density fraction pools ( Figures 1 E,S1E, and S1F). In sum-mary, a high-resolution iodixanol density gradient separates
small extracellular membrane vesicles bearing the hallmarks ofsEVs-exosomes from non-vesicular components.Proteomic Proﬁling of Small Extracellular Vesicles andNon-vesicular FractionsTo assess the protein composition of density gradient-puriﬁedsEVs and NVs, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrom-etry (LC-MS/MS) was performed ( Figure S2 A;Tables S2 ,S3,and S4). Despite considerable overlap between the fractionsin terms of identiﬁable proteins, it became strikingly clear thatgradient-puriﬁed sEVs are highly distinct from NVs ( Figures 2 A–2C,S2B, and S2C). Syntenin-1(gene SDCBP) and ALIX (PDCD6IP)were among the most abundant proteins identiﬁed in the densitygradient-puriﬁed sEV samples and are two of the most highly ex-pressed exosomal proteins found with more sophisticated puriﬁ-cation methods ( Kowal et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018 ). Themost abundant proteins in the NV fractions were metabolic en-zymes like GAPDH, PKM, and ENO1, and cytosolic proteins
including HSP90 and tubulins ( Table S5 ). As expected, common
most abundant proteins in the NV fractions were metabolic en-zymes like GAPDH, PKM, and ENO1, and cytosolic proteinsincluding HSP90 and tubulins ( Table S5 ). As expected, commonexosomal markers were relatively overexpressed in gradient-puri-ﬁed sEVs ( Figures 2 Da n d S2D). Histones are frequently identiﬁedand among the most abundant proteins in proteomic analysis ofsEVs-exosomes ( Zhang et al., 2018 ). However, histones H2Aand H3 were highly enriched in NV fractions. LC-MS/MS resultswere validated, including the distinct association of histones withNV fractions ( Figures 2 Ea n d S2E). Of the 25 most frequently re-ported proteins in the ExoCarta exosome database ( Keerthikumaret al., 2016 ), many were more associated with NV fractions thanpuriﬁed sEV fractions, including GAPDH, PKM, and HSP90 ( Fig-ures 2 Fa n d S2F). In summary, proteomic proﬁling reveals thatafter high-resolution iodixanol density gradient puriﬁcation, some
presumed exosomal proteins were more associated with NVfractions than with fractions containing sEVs-exosomes.Differential Expression of RNA in Small ExtracellularVesicles and Non-vesicular FractionsExtracellular RNA (exRNA) was extracted from density gradient-puriﬁed sEV and NV pooled fractions. Distinct ribosomal RNA(rRNA) peaks (18S and 28S) were diminished in the extracellularlEV, sEV, and NV samples, while small RNA species were en-riched ( Figure S2 G). Short RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) ( STARMethods ) revealed enrichment of rRNA fragments and other(C) Density gradient fractionation of DKO-1 and Gli36 crude small EVs (P120).

speciﬁc small RNAs or RNA fragments in the extracellular sam-ples ( Figure 2 G). The overall pattern of miRNA expression wasdistinctly different not only between cellular and secretedmiRNAs but also between sEV and NV fractions ( Figure 2 H).Numerous miRNAs displayed signiﬁcant differential distributionbetween puriﬁed sEV and NV fractions and between puriﬁedsEVs and their parental cells ( Figure S2 H;Tables S6 and S7).Many of the most abundant miRNAs were more associatedwith extracellular NV fractions than with either parental cells orsEV fractions ( Figure 2 I). Strong enrichment for extracellulartransfer RNA (tRNA) fragments was also observed, particularlyfor lEV and sEV samples ( Figure 2 G). Y-box protein 1 (YBX1) isan RBP reported to be present in exosomes and responsiblefor sorting miRNA and tRNA into exosomes ( Shurtleff et al.,2016, 2017 ). However, YBX1 was not detected in either sEV orNV samples released from DKO-1 cells and was more abundant
in Gli36 NV fractions than sEV fractions after gradient puriﬁcation(Figure S2 I). YBX1 is responsible for sorting miR-223 and miR-144 into HEK293T-derived exosomes ( Shurtleff et al., 2016 );however, both were detected with very low abundance in ourshort RNA-seq of DKO-1 and Gli36 cells and extracellular sam-ples ( Figure S2 J). The 30termini of cellular miRNAs and puriﬁedsEV miRNAs were broadly similar, but the NV fraction miRNAsdisplayed marked trimming ( Figure S2 K). YRNAs and vaultRNAs (VTRNA) were enriched in extracellular samples withVTRNA in particular associated with NV fractions ( Figure 2 G).Long RNA-seq revealed that the distribution of transcriptsamong lEVs, sEVs and NV fractions were similar, while protein-coding transcripts comprised a larger percentage of cellularsamples compared to extracellular samples ( Figure S2 L).Strikingly, the overwhelming majority of cellular long RNA readsmapped to exonic regions, while the majority of extracellular
reads mapped to intronic regions ( Figure S2 M). The abundanceof large intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) was greater for allextracellular samples compared to parental cells ( Figure S2 N)and the patterns of lincRNA expression were clearly distinct ( Fig-ure S2 O). YRNA, and fragments or processed versions of YRNA,have repeatedly been reported to be present and enriched incrude samples of sEVs compared to cells ( Chakrabortty et al.,2015; Nolte-’t Hoen et al., 2012 ). By short RNA-seq, weobserved that YRNA was also enriched in lEVs and gradient-puriﬁed NV fractions ( Figures 2 G and S2P). However, whenlooking at primary full-length transcripts by long RNA-seq, extra-cellular enrichment was much less pronounced, but, once again,substantial amounts of full-length YRNA were associated withNV fractions ( Figure S2 Q). In summary, exRNAs are differentiallydistributed between puriﬁed sEV and extracellular non-vesicularfractions.Secretion of Human Argonaute 1–4 Is Independent of
ExosomesExosome-mediated secretion of human Ago proteins and othercomponents of the miRNA biogenesis machinery and RISC ( Fig-ure 3 A) is an unsettled controversy ( Arroyo et al., 2011; Meloet al., 2014; Shurtleff et al., 2016 ). Human Ago proteins arereleased from cells and can be recovered in the 120,000 3gpellet (P120) following ultracentrifugation ( Figures 3 B and S3A).None of the other common miRNA-associated proteins weredetected in extracellular lEVs (P15) and crude sEVs (P120),including Drosha, DGCR8, Dicer, GW182 (gene TRNC6A ), andTRBP ( Figures 3 B and S3A). Ago1 and Ago2 proteins can befound intracellularly in membrane-less cytoplasmic organellesprocessing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules ( Hubsten-berger et al., 2017; Jain et al., 2016 ). The mRNA-decappingenzyme DCP1A is a canonical marker for P-bodies, whileG3BP1 and G3BP2 are canonical markers for stress granules(Hubstenberger et al., 2017 ). The existence of so-called ‘‘GW-
bodies,’’ distinct from P-bodies and lacking DCP1A, has been
bodies,’’ distinct from P-bodies and lacking DCP1A, has beensuggested based on the localization of Ago2 with GW182 atMVEs ( Gibbings et al., 2009 ). It is unlikely that extracellular Agoproteins arise from gross contamination of sEV samples withP-bodies, stress granules, or GW bodies as DCP1A, GW182,Drosha, and Dicer were all absent from crude sEVs (P120) ( Fig-ures 3 B and S3A), and G3BP1 and G3BP2 were less abundantin extracellular samples compared to cells ( Figure S3 B). It istherefore unlikely that extracellular Ago proteins arise from grosscontamination of sEV samples with P-bodies, stress granules, orGW bodies. Detection of human Ago1–4 proteins was not due tocontamination from bovine growth serum ( Figure S3 C). Ago2was present in samples of crude sEVs isolated from freshlyresected colorectal cancers and adjacent normal mucosa(STAR Methods ); however, the other miRNA-associated proteinsDGCR8, Dicer, and TRBP, were not ( Figure 3C). In human
C). In humanplasma, Ago2 and HDL (ApoA1) were present in gradient-puri-ﬁed NV pool, but absent from the sEV pool ( Figures 3 D andS3D). The two ESCRT proteins TSG101 and ALIX were enrichedin crude sEVs (P120) from cancer cell lines ( Figure S3 E) andgradient-puriﬁed sEVs ( Figures 2 E, 2F, and 3E), but undetectablein plasma sEV (P120) samples ( Figures S3 E and S3F).

after high-resolution density gradient puriﬁcation ( Figures 3 E andS3G), although the Gli36 cell line also had a minor population ofAgo1–4 that was associated with puriﬁed sEV fractions ( Fig-ure 3 E). The heat shock proteins HSP90 and HSC70, necessaryfor loading duplex miRNA into Ago proteins, were present in pu-riﬁed sEV and NV fractions ( Figures 2 F,3E, and S3D–S3F ). Toindependently validate our high-resolution gradient density frac-tionation, we developed a DIC approach designed to speciﬁcallypurify classical exosomes bearing the canonical tetraspaninmarkers CD63, CD81, and CD9 ( Figure 4 A). The term ‘‘direct’’ re-fers to two aspects of this approach: the use of magnetic beadsdirectly conjugated to capture antibody, and the addition of thebeads directly to sEV samples still in solution without any pre-concentration or ultracentrifugation steps to avoid aggrega-tion/contamination of exosomes with other non-exosomal
sEVs or NV components. CD81-, CD63-, and CD9-positive clas-sical exosomes did not contain Ago2, and CD81-positive exo-somes did not contain Ago1, Ago3, or Ago4 ( Figure 4 B). Althoughwe observed minor populations of Ago1–4 in Gli36 densitygradient-puriﬁed sEV fractions, Ago proteins were absent inDIC-puriﬁed Gli36 exosomes, indicating that sEVs potentiallycarrying Ago1–4 must be distinct from exosomes ( Figure 4 C).Surprisingly, HSP90 was undetectable in classical exosomes(Figures 4 B and 4C). In summary, cells secrete Ago1–4 indepen-dently of exosomes. No evidence could be uncovered thatexosomes, or any other type of sEV, contain other major compo-nents of the miRNA biogenesis machinery.Extracellular Release of RNA-Binding Proteins andVaultsMultiple RBPs have previously been linked to exosomes. Weinvestigated hnRNPA2B1 (poly-A RNA-binding, miRNA), RPS3and RPS8 (ribosome), EEF2 (translation), EEF1A1 (tRNA),
PARK7/DJ1 (poly-A RNA-binding), GAPDH (unclear RNA-bind-ing), and MVP (VTRNA), as these are among the top RBPsreported in exosomes in their respective functional category ( Ma-teescu et al., 2017 ). Sorting of miRNA into exosomes has beenattributed to sumolyation of the ribonucleoprotein hnRNPA2B1(Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013 ). Neither hnRNPA2B1, nor its /C2410–12 kDa larger sumoylated form, could be detected in crudesEV (P120) preparations ( Figure 4 D). Ribosomal proteins arecommonly found in exosomal preparations even when attemptshave been made to improve sample purity beyond that obtainableby standard ultracentrifugation protocols ( Kowal et al., 2016;Zhang et al., 2018 ). However, RPS3 and RPS8 were both associ-ated with NV fractions ( Figures 4 E,S1B, and S1C), and RPS3and RPS8 were absent from exosomes bearing the classical tet-raspanin markers ( Figures 4 F and 4G). GAPDH is widely reportedto be present in exosomes and microvesicles ( van Niel et al.,
2018 ), but GAPDH was more associated with NV fractions thansEV fractions ( Figures 1 C,2F,S1D, and S2F). By DIC, GAPDHwas not detectable in CD63-, CD81-, and CD9-positive exo-somes ( Figures 4 F–4H). EEF2 was mostly associated with extra-cellular NV fractions, while some EEF1A1 was found to ﬂoat atdensities consistent with its presence in sEVs ( Figures 2 F,4E,S1D, and S2F); however, neither protein was present in classicalexosomes ( Figures 4 F–4H). PARK7/DJ1 was distinctly associ-ated with ﬂotation in sEV fractions (Figure 4 E), but, once again,not present in classical exosomes ( Figures 4 F and 4G). Ago2,GAPDH, and EEF2 were not detected in CD81-positive exosomesderived from primary human renal epithelial cells ( Figure 4 H).MVP is a proposed miRNA-binding protein responsible forsorting miRNA to exosomes ( Teng et al., 2017 ). MVP was foundin NV fractions ( Figure 4 E) and conﬁrmed by DIC to not be asso-ciated with exosomes ( Figures 4 F–4H). MVP is the major protein

ciated with exosomes ( Figures 4 F–4H). MVP is the major proteincomponent (>70%) of vaults, large 41 nm by 72.5 nm ribonucleo-protein cytoplasmic particles ( Figure 4 I) (Rome and Kickhoefer,2013 ). Humans express four non-coding cytoplasmic VTRNAs:VTRNA1-1 (98 bases), VTRNA1-2, VTRNA1-3 (88 bases), andVTRNA2-1 (102 bases) single exon transcripts. Some of theVTRNA also associate with Lupus La protein (La), although Lais not present in highly puriﬁed vault samples ( Rome and Kick-hoefer, 2013 ). Analysis revealed intact vault structures in theNV pool ( Figure 4 J), while no such structures were observed inpuriﬁed sEV pools ( Figures 1 E and S1E). The three vault proteinsMVP, VPARP, and TEP1 were greatly enriched in the NV pool aswas La protein ( Figure 4 K). Enrichment of VTRNA in exosomeshas previously been reported ( Nolte-’t Hoen et al., 2012 ). ShortRNA-seq analysis conﬁrmed enrichment of reads mappedto extracellular VTRNA with marked enrichment in the NV pool
(Figure 4 L). In contrast, long RNA-seq revealed marked cellularenrichment of VTRNA compared to extracellular samples(Figure 4 M). Thus, extracellular VTRNA is predominantly eitherprocessed small VTRNA or fragments of VTRNA. In summary,the commonly reported exosomal RBPs investigated (Ago1–4,RPS3, RPS8, EEF2, EEF1A1, hnRNPA2B1, PARK7/DJ1,GAPDH, and MVP) were absent from classical exosomes whenadvanced puriﬁcation methods were employed.Exosomes Exclude Common Glycolytic Enzymes andLack a CytoskeletonAs noted above, the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH was absent fromclassical exosomes ( Figures 4 F–4H). Prompted by this ﬁnding,we examined pyruvate kinase M1/2 (PKM) and enolase 1(ENO1), two abundant cytosolic glycolytic enzymes that areamong the 25 most commonly identiﬁed exosomal proteins.PKM was enriched in NV fractions, but ENO1 was enriched insEV fractions after high-resolution density gradient fractionation(Figures 2 F and S2F). However, both PKM and ENO1 were
completely undetectable in classical exosomes when probedby DIC ( Figure S4 A). The widely expressed 14-3-3 proteins areinvolved in signal transduction and, as expected, enriched insEV fractions ( Figures 2 F and S2F) but, surprisingly, absentfrom CD81-positive exosomes ( Figure S4 A).

keratins are highly abundant cellular cytoskeletal proteinsobserved in exosomal-sEV and microvesicle-lEV samples,even when more sophisticated puriﬁcation techniques are em-ployed ( Kowal et al., 2016; Mathivanan et al., 2010; Zhanget al., 2018 ). Actins, tubulins, and keratins were also present inour proteomic datasets for sEVs, including keratin 8, 10, 18,and 19 ( Tables S3 and S4). The presence of keratin 8+18 and19 in crude sEVs (P120) was conﬁrmed ( Figure S4 B), while kera-tin 10, a skin keratin notorious for being a contaminant in massspectrometry analyses, was not detected by immunoblotting(data not shown). a-Actinin-4 is an actin-binding cytoskeletonprotein reported to be enriched in lEVs over sEVs ( Kowal et al.,2016 ); we observed a strong enrichment of a-actinin-4 in lEVs(P15) ( Figure S4 B). Extracellular b-actin was present in onepool, consistent with its presence in sEVs, and one pool consis-tent with NV fractions; a-actinin-4 was associated with the light-
est fractions and a-tubulin with NV fractions ( Figure S4 C). We didnot ﬁnd evidence that classical CD63-, CD81-, and CD9-positiveexosomes possess the cytoskeletal constituents that make upactin ﬁlaments, microtubules, or intermediate ﬁlaments ( Fig-ure S4 D). Integrins on tumor exosomes have been reported topredict organ-speciﬁc metastasis ( Hoshino et al., 2015 ). Integrinb1 was barely detectable on CD81- and CD63-positive exo-somes while integrin a2 was more abundant ( Figures S4 E andS4F), suggesting that integrin b1 is more associated with non-exosomal sEVs. Considering that integrin b1 is enriched in300–900 nm microvesicles ( Muralidharan-Chari et al., 2009 ),these vesicles may be sub-200 nm microvesicles. Epidermalgrowth factor receptor (EGFR) was present in classical exo-somes, as previously reported ( Higginbotham et al., 2016 ), butother sEVs must account for a signiﬁcant part of extracellularEGFR ( Figures S4 E and S4F). This was also the case for the
plasma membrane marker Na+/K+-ATPase ( Figures S4 E andS4F). Several members of the RAB GTPase family of proteinsare implicated in sorting and trafﬁcking of MVEs to the plasmamembrane including RAB7, RAB11, and RAB27A ( van Nielet al., 2018 ). However, these proteins do not appear to be infor-mative markers for exosomes per se as relatively little of theextracellular RABs appear to be present in classical exosomes(Figures S4 E and S4F). In summary, exosomes exclude highlyabundant cytosolic enzymes, are vesicles without cytoskele-tons, and proteins involved in exosome biogenesis cannot beassumed to be constituents of exosomes.Annexin A1 Is a Novel and Speciﬁc Marker ofMicrovesicles Distinct from Exosomes and ARMMsAnnexins are abundant membrane-associated proteins thathave been identiﬁed as exosomal constituents ( Kowal et al.,2016; van Niel et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018 ). Annexins weregreatly enriched in DKO-1 and Gli36 puriﬁed sEV fractions ( Fig-
ure 5 A). Annexin A1, A2, A3, and V were enriched in lEVs (P15)compared to gradient-puriﬁed sEVs while the opposite wastrue for annexin VII and XI ( Figures 5 A and 5B). The expressionof annexin A1 and A2 was shifted toward the lower densitiescompared to the exosomal marker CD9 ( Figure 5 C). Using adifferent formulation of the iodixanol gradient ( Figure S5 A;STAR Methods ), designed to increase resolution at the lowerﬂotation density range of sEVs, the buoyant density pattern ofannexin A1- and A2-positive sEVs was markedly shifted towardlower densities compared to TSG101 and ALIX ( Figure 5 D).Annexin A1 and A2 also ﬂoated at decidedly lower densitiesthan the two lipid raft proteins, ﬂotillin-1 and ﬂotillin-2, whilethe epithelial marker EpCAM overlapped with both groups(Figure 5 D). Both annexin A1 and A2 were undetectable inCD81-, CD9-, and CD63-positive exosomes ( Figures 5 E andS5B–S5D). Annexin V is a commonly observed exosomal protein
(Figure 5 D). Both annexin A1 and A2 were undetectable inCD81-, CD9-, and CD63-positive exosomes ( Figures 5 E andS5B–S5D). Annexin V is a commonly observed exosomal protein(Figures 2 F and S2F), but while the protein ﬂoats at densitiesconsistent with EVs ( Figure 5 C), it was absent from CD63-,CD81-, and CD9-positive exosomes ( Figures 5 E and S5B–S5D). Two other annexins, VII and XI, both had ﬂotation densitiescloser to that of CD9 than did annexin A1 and A2 ( Figure 5 C). An-nexin XI may be common to several types of sEV ( Kowal et al.,2016 ), and we conﬁrmed its presence in CD81- and CD9-posi-tive exosomes ( Figures S5 B and S5C). The same pattern wasobserved for annexin VII ( Figures S5 B and S5C). As annexin A1was absent from exosomes but present in samples of both smalland large EVs, we investigated the possibility that annexin A1marks microvesicles. Structured illumination microscopy (SIM)revealed that annexin A1 strongly stained the plasma membrane,
and annexin A1-positive vesicles could be observed to buddirectly from the plasma membrane ( Figures 5 F and S5E). An-nexin A1-positive vesicles had a size distribution of /C24150 nmFigure 4.

to 1mm, consistent with classical microvesicles ( Figure 5 F;TableS1). The resolution limit of SIM did not allow vesicles smaller than/C24150 nm to be conclusively resolved as budding vesicles. Inaddition to classical microvesicles, we also observed very large(/C241–5mm) plasma membrane blebbing ( Figure 5 G). The struc-ture and size distribution of these protrusions were remarkablysimilar to that of large oncosomes released from prostate cancercells ( Minciacchi et al., 2017 ). ARF6 regulates abscission andshedding of microvesicles ( Muralidharan-Chari et al., 2009 ) andpossibly large oncosomes ( Minciacchi et al., 2015 ). ARF6 wasenriched in both lEVs and sEVs ( Figure 5 H), again suggestingthe presence of potential <200 nm microvesicles. Arrestin-domain-containing protein 1 (ARRDC1)-mediated microvesicles(ARMMs) are a relatively recently described type of small ( /C2440–100 nm) EV that bud directly from the plasma membrane, medi-
ated by ARRDC1 and TSG101 ( Nabhan et al., 2012; Wang andLu, 2017 ). Both ARRDC1 and TSG101 were highly associatedwith sEVs, but much less so with lEVs ( Figure 5 H). ARRDC1was largely absent from CD63- and CD81-positive DKO-1 vesi-cles ( Figures 5 I and S5B), while a faint signal for ARRDC1 wasdetected in CD9-positive DKO-1 vesicles ( Figure 5 I). In contrast,robust signals were observed for ARRDC1 in CD81- and CD9-positive Gli36 vesicles with expression levels similar (CD81-pos-itive) or enriched (CD9-positive) compared with that of matchedcrude sEVs (P120) ( Figure 5 J). Expression of TSG101 was veryweak in CD81- and CD63-positive vesicles, but stronger inCD9-positive vesicles ( Figures 5 I, 5J, and S5B), suggestingTSG101 may be more associated with ARMMs than classicalexosomes. In contrast, ALIX and syntenin-1 were strongly asso-ciated with CD63-, CD81-, and CD9-positive vesicles ( Figures4C, 4F, 4G, 5I–5K, S4E, and S4F). Annexin A1 expression
spanned the range from small ( /C24150 nm) to large ( /C241,000 nm)EVs while ARMMs are small ( /C2440–100 nm). Annexin A1 and A2were absent from the tetraspanin-enriched vesicles, whileARRDC1 and TSG101 were present. Annexin A1 and A2 wereenriched in lEVs, whereas ARRDC1 and TSG101 were enrichedin sEVs. Based on the sum of the evidence, annexin A1- and/orannexin A2-positive EVs are distinct from both classical exo-somes and ARMMs. Annexin A1- and A2-positive sEVs couldbe gradient-puriﬁed from human plasma ( Figure S5 F). DIC-puri-ﬁed CD81-positive plasma exosomes did not express annexinA1 and A2, but did express the exosomal markers CD9, synte-nin-1, and ﬂotillin-1, as well as annexin XI ( Figure 5 K). In sum-mary, annexin A1 and A2 are novel markers of population(s) ofEVs distinct from classical exosomes and ARMMs. Biogenesisof annexin A1-positive 150–1,000 nm vesicles entails sheddingfrom the plasma membrane, making annexin A1 a speciﬁc
molecular marker of classical microvesicles.Release of Extracellular DNA and Histones from HumanCells Is Independent of Exosomes and SmallExtracellular VesiclesIt has previously been reported that dsDNA is present in cancerexosomes or sEVs ( Montermini et al., 2015), and several studiesidentiﬁed dsDNA-binding histone proteins in exosomal prepara-tions ( Takahashi et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018 ). However, theobservation that dsDNA-binding histones were associated withNV fractions rather than puriﬁed sEVs ( Figures 2 D, 2E, and S2)prompted us to examine the release of DNA. Histones H2A,H3, and H4 were absent from the fractions dominated by exoso-mal-sEV marker proteins ( Figures 6 A and S6A). After DNAextraction from puriﬁed sEV and NV pools, it was apparent thatdsDNA is present in high-density NV fractions, with post-extrac-tion treatment of the puriﬁed nucleic acid with DNase and RNaseconﬁrming isolation of pure DNA ( Figures 6 B,S6B, and S6C). To
determine if extracellular dsDNA is protected from digestion, we
tion treatment of the puriﬁed nucleic acid with DNase and RNaseconﬁrming isolation of pure DNA ( Figures 6 B,S6B, and S6C). Todetermine if extracellular dsDNA is protected from digestion, wepre-treated crude sEV (P120) samples with DNase I before pro-ceeding with density gradient fractionation and DNA extraction.As before, no dsDNA was detected in sEV fractions, and thedsDNA present in NV fractions was highly susceptible to diges-tion by DNase I ( Figures 6 C and S6B). The majority of DNA was inthe range of 1,000–10,000 bp with a peak around 6,000 bp ( Fig-ures 6 D and S6D). Histones were not detected in associationwith CD81- or CD63-positive exosomes ( Figure 6 E). Likewise,it was not possible to detect any dsDNA associated with DIC-puriﬁed CD81-positive exosomes, conﬁrming that exosomesdo not natively contain dsDNA and do not associate with otherparticles or proteins that contain dsDNA ( Figure 6 F). The pres-ence of histones and dsDNA in preparations of exosomes and
other sEVs therefore appears to be an indicator of insufﬁcientpuriﬁcation that largely disappears with improved methodology.In summary, extracellular dsDNA and histones are not associ-ated with exosomes or any other type of sEV.Active Secretion of DNA and Histones through anAmphisome-Dependent MechanismIt has been reported that dsDNA can be present inside MVEs(Takahashi et al., 2017 ), and cytoplasmic chromatin has recently(B) Immunoblot analysis of annexin expression in cells, lEVs (P15), and crude sEVs (P120).(C) High-resolution (12%–36%) density fractionation of crude DKO-1 sEVs (P120).(D) Gradient (6%–30%) density fractionation of crude DKO-1 sEVs (P120).(E) DIC of CD81- and CD9-positive exosomes from DKO-1 cells.

been recognized as a driver of carcinogenesis and metastasis(Bakhoum et al., 2018; Dou et al., 2015 ). To investigate the pres-ence of cytoplasmic DNA, we turned to multi-color SIM imaging.The presence of cytoplasmic DNA in the form of micronuclei wasa consistently observable phenomenon ( Figures 7 A and S7A).Strikingly, CD63-positive intracellular compartments werereadily observed among the micronuclei, while staining withCD9 was punctate ( Figures 7 A, 7B, S7A, and S7B). The sizeand morphology of CD63-positive compartments were consis-tent with their identity as MVEs. Smaller MVEs frequently dis-played a simpler and sometimes hollow appearance, whereaslarger MVEs frequently displayed a multi-compartment appear-ance with internal staining ( Figures 7 C and S7C). Some CD63-positive compartments co-localized with dsDNA, but peak stain-ing intensities tended to be offset from each other, indicating thatdsDNA does not co-localize with CD63-positive ILVs inside the
larger compartment ( Figure 7 D). Histone H3 was also observedin some CD63-positive, MVE-like compartments ( Figure 7 E).Although the biochemical data clearly demonstrated that extra-cellular dsDNA and histones were not released in exosomesand sEVs ( Figure 6 ), it was also apparent that cytoplasmic chro-matin could be localized to CD63-positive compartments. Inautophagy, the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome togenerate an autolysosome for degradation of autophagosomalcargo. However, in a pre-lysosomal step, the autophagosomemay undergo fusion with an MVE to form a hybrid organelletermed an amphisome ( Eskelinen, 2005; Fader et al., 2008;Hessvik et al., 2016; Klionsky et al., 2014 ). Both the autophago-somal proteins p62 ( Hessvik et al., 2016 ) and LC3 ( Chen et al.,2017 ) co-localize with CD63-positive MVEs, indicative of amphi-somes. We observed localization of p62 in CD63-positive com-partments, suggesting amphisomes ( Figure 7 F). For autophago-
some formation to occur, cytosolic LC3 must be conjugated withphosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to generate the membrane-inserting LC3-PE form. Amphisomes were observed as hybridorganelles bearing both CD63 and LC3B ( Figures 7 G and S7D),suggesting some of the CD63-positive compartments previouslyobserved to contain dsDNA and Histone H3 might representamphisomes rather than MVEs. LC3B-PE interacts with laminB1 to mediate the autophagy-dependent degradation of cyto-plasmic chromatin ( Dou et al., 2015 ). We could localize dsDNAto CD63- and LC3B-positive amphisomes, and some amphi-somes were observed at the plasma membrane ( Figure 7 H).This indicates that rather than fusing with the lysosome, amphi-somes may fuse with the plasma membrane. The presence ofLC3-PE has been suggested to be a feature of autophagy-related exosomes ( Chen et al., 2017; Hessvik et al., 2016 ).Both large and small EVs released from DKO-1 cells express
LC3B-PE with particular enrichment in lEVs (P15) ( Figure 7 I),and LC3B-PE was detected in crude sEV preparations fromFigure 7.

For autophagy, cytosolic LC3 is lipidated by conjugation with phosphatidyleth anolamine
to form LC3-PE. (1) Nuclear membranes can bleb in a process dependent on LC3B and the nuclear lamina protein Lamin B1, causing the appearance ofcytoplasmic chromatin fragments. (2) During autophagy, cytoplasmic components are sequestered as a phagophore begins to engulf material. (3) Cont inuedexpansion of autophagic membranes requires LC3-PE and results in formation of the double-membrane autophagosome. (4) As early endosomes develop to lateendosomes, the pH decreases and continued invagination of limiting membranes generates intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). A fully developed CD63-posi tive
multivesicular endosome (MVE) contains numerous ILVs. (5) Fusion of the autophagosome with a MVE causes degradation of the inner autophagosomemembrane generating an amphisome, a single-membrane hybrid compartment. (6) The amphisome fuses with a lysosomal compartment to form theautolysosome followed by degradation of cargo, or alternatively, (7) the amphisome fuses with the plasma membrane causing extracellular release of dsDNAand histones, and separately, the ILVs as exosomes.See also Figure S7 andTable S1 .Cell 177, 428–445, April 4, 2019 441
CRC samples ( Figures 7 I and S7E). However, the ﬂotation den-sity pattern of LC3B-PE sEVs differed from that of the exosomalmarker protein syntenin-1 ( Figure 7 J), which suggested thatLC3B-PE-expressing sEVs are not exosomes. DIC conclusivelydemonstrated that LC3B-PE and p62-expressing autophagicextracellular vesicles (AEVs) are distinct from CD63-, CD81-,and CD9-positive exosomes ( Figure 7 K). Because dsDNA andhistones, while present in crude sEV samples, are exclusivelyreleased as non-vesicular entities, sEV-sized AEVs are not car-riers of extracellular chromatin. Rather, the evidence supportsa mechanism involving engulfment of cytoplasmic chromatinby an LC3B-PE-positive autophagosome followed by mergingwith a CD63-positive MVE to form an amphisome, which, uponfusion with the plasma membrane, releases dsDNA and histonesindependently of ILVs-exosomes ( Figure 7 L). This model ofactive secretion reconciles the major ﬁndings that (1) extracel-
lular dsDNA and histones are not present in exosomes/sEVs,(2) cytoplasmic dsDNA and histones are localized to CD63-positive intracellular compartments, but not ILVs, (3) intracellularCD63- and LC3B-positive amphisomes localize with dsDNA,(4) cytoplasmic chromatin is cleared by an LC3B-dependentmechanism, and (5) CD63- and LC3B-positive amphisomeslocalize to the plasma membrane. In summary, dsDNA andhistones co-localize with CD63-positive compartments, butdsDNA does not co-localize with ILVs. LC3B- and CD63-positiveamphisomes contain dsDNA and amphisomes can be visualizedat the plasma membrane. We therefore propose a model ofactive secretion of cytoplasmic DNA and histones through anautophagy- and MVE-dependent, but exosome-independentmechanism.DISCUSSIONUsing two different yet highly complementary techniques, high-resolution density gradient fractionation and DIC, we demon-
strate separation of sEVs from extracellular NV compartmentsand the ability to include or exclude a molecular component toclassical exosomes. Ultracentrifugation ( R100,000 3g) causesaggregation of vesicles ( Jeppesen et al., 2014a; Linares et al.,2015 ) and to ensure that the DIC approach was not compro-mised, we used samples that had not been subjected to ultra-centrifugation or concentration steps that might cause aggrega-tion of vesicles. Surprisingly, many of the presumed componentsof exosomes ( Kowal et al., 2016; van Niel et al., 2018; Zhanget al., 2018 ) were absent from classical exosomes expressingCD63, CD81, and CD9. This leaves open the question of hypo-thetical non-classical exosomes generated by the MVE biogen-esis pathway, but lacking these three classical exosomaltetraspanin markers. There is evidence in support of ILV andMVE heterogeneity ( Edgar et al., 2014; Stuffers et al., 2009;van Niel et al., 2011 ), and subpopulations of CD63/CD81/CD9-
negative ILVs could conceivably be released as non-classicalexosomes. Some proteins, including GAPDH, ENO1, 14-3-3,HSP90, and PARK7/DJ1, are present in sEVs, although theyare absent from classical exosomes. Highly abundant cytosolicproteins, including GAPDH, PKM, ENO1, 14-3-3, and HSP90are absent from classical exosomes as are the common proteincomponents of microﬁlaments, microtubules, and intermediateﬁlaments ( Figures 4 and S4). The uptake of cytosolic constitu-ents during classical exosome biogenesis is therefore notrandom—rather exosome loading must be a highly regulatedprocess. In some ways, the NV fractions obtained with thehigh-resolution density gradient resemble the recently describednon-membranous nanoparticles termed ‘‘exomeres’’ ( Zhanget al., 2018, 2019 ). This includes lack of membrane-vesicularstructure, depletion of membrane proteins, the presence of sug-gested exomere markers HSP90 and HSPA13 ( Figures 3 and
S3), as well as mitochondrial, cytoskeleton, metabolic, andAgo proteins ( Zhang et al., 2019 ). We demonstrate here thatAgo proteins are absent from classical exosomes, and none of
S3), as well as mitochondrial, cytoskeleton, metabolic, andAgo proteins ( Zhang et al., 2019 ). We demonstrate here thatAgo proteins are absent from classical exosomes, and none ofthe other nuclear or cytosolic miRNA machinery, includingDrosha, DGCR8, Dicer, TRBP, and GW182, were detectedextracellularly ( Figures 3 and 4). Thus, exosomes do not carrythe necessary molecular machinery to carry out cell-indepen-dent miRNA biogenesis as previously suggested ( Melo et al.,2014 ). Given that many of the most abundant miRNAs are asso-ciated with extracellular NV fractions rather than with puriﬁedsEVs ( Figure 2 ), detection of an extracellular miRNA is neitherprima facie nor sufﬁcient evidence that the secretion mechanismis due to exosome or EV release. None of the frequently reportedexosomal RBPs ( Hagiwara et al., 2015; Mateescu et al., 2017 )that we investigated (Ago1–4, annexin A2, RPS3, RPS8, EEF2,EEF1A1, MVP, PARK7/DJ1, hnRNPA2B1, and GAPDH) were
associated with classical CD63-, CD81-, or CD9-positive exo-somes. However, sEV fractions did display a signiﬁcant pres-ence of exRNA, and other investigators have shown that EV-associated exRNA can be protected from degradation by RNase(Shurtleff et al., 2017 ). Therefore, non-exosomal EVs may besigniﬁcant carriers of exRNA and RBPs.We have identiﬁed the membrane-associated proteins an-nexin A1 and A2 as novel markers of non-exosomal small to largeEVs and observed 150–1,000 nm annexin A1-positive microve-sicles budding off the plasma membrane ( Figure 5 ). Both pro-teins are absent from classical CD63-, CD81-, and CD9-positiveexosomes in vitro and in vivo (Figures 5 andS5). Annexin A1 thusappears to ﬁt the criteria for a speciﬁc protein marker of classicalshedding microvesicles, distinct from both exosomes and
ARMMs. It is not yet clear if annexin A1- and annexin A2-positiveEVs are identical. Phosphatidylserine is enriched in sucrose-gradient puriﬁed sEVs ( Trajkovic et al., 2008 ); however, annexinV is not present on classical exosomes ( Figures 5 andS5). Thislikely indicates that phosphatidylserine is not exposed on theouter leaﬂet of exosomal membranes.We demonstrate that dsDNA in the extracellular environmentis not associated with exosomes or any other type of sEV ( Fig-ure 6 ), although it can co-purify with them using standard ultra-centrifugation or sucrose density gradients ( Takahashi et al.,2017 ). However, we ﬁnd that dsDNA and histones are presentintracellularly in CD63-positive compartments of a size consis-tent with MVEs, the site of ILV/exosome biogenesis, and weprovide evidence that intracellular CD63- and LC3B-decoratedcompartments may trafﬁc their dsDNA cargo to the plasmamembrane ( Figure 7 ). We propose a model of autophagy- and
MVE-dependent, but exosome-independent, active secretionof dsDNA and histones ( Figure 7 L). The model rests on a numberof recent discoveries: (1) presence of cytoplasmic chromatin in442 Cell 177, 428–445, April 4, 2019
cancer and the autophagy (LC3B)-mediated nuclear-to-cyto-plasmic transport and degradation of chromatin fragments(Bakhoum et al., 2018; Dou et al., 2015 ); (2) existence of amphi-somes ( Berg et al., 1998; Klionsky et al., 2014 )(Figure 7 ); (3) pres-ence of dsDNA within MVEs and/or amphisomes independent ofILVs ( Figure 7 ); and (4) presence of amphisomes at the plasmamembrane and absence of dsDNA and histones in exosomes(Figures 6 and 7). Engulfment of cytoplasmic components andsubsequent amphisome-dependent extracellular cargo releasecould conceivably be a more general mechanism of secretionfor diverse non-membranous molecular component assembliessuch as NV fractions and exomeres.In summary, we have demonstrated that improved methodol-ogy for exosome isolation allows more precise determination ofthe molecular composition of classical exosomes. Speciﬁcally,the classical tetraspanin-enriched exosomes contain a more
limited repertoire of the diverse molecules present in the extra-cellular milieu than has previously been assumed (summarizedinFigure S7 F). The conceptual and methodological frameworkprovided here is a step toward a better understanding of theheterogeneity of extracellular vesicles and particles (summa-rized in Table S1 ). It will be of utmost importance for the futuretherapeutic potential and design of treatment interventions tocorrectly identify the compartment and mechanisms by whichspeciﬁc DNA, RNA, and proteins are secreted in human disease.STAR+METHODSDetailed methods are provided in the online version of this paperand include the following:dKEY RESOURCES TABLEdCONTACT FOR REAGENT AND RESOURCE SHARINGdEXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILSBCell lines and cultureBHuman samplesdMETHOD DETAILSBExtracellular vesicle isolation from cultured cells grownin dishesBExtracellular vesicle isolation from cultured cells grownin bioreactors

epithelial cells were generated from transplant discards purchased from Innovative BioTherapies (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Primarycultures for production of extracellular vesicles was initiated at passage 2, and cells were maintained in DMEM supplementedwith 2 mgm l-1Normocin, Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium (ITS), epidermal growth factor (EGF), hydrocortisone and T3 thyroid hormone(complete formulation available upon request).Human samplesFresh peripheral blood from healthy individuals, and resected colorectal cancers and adjacent normal mucosa were processedimmediately without any freezing of samples as described in detail below. All procedures on peripheral blood specimens and humantissue were approved and performed in accordance with the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board(IRB#161529).METHOD DETAILSExtracellular vesicle isolation from cultured cells grown in dishes
Cell-conditioned medium was collected from approximately 90% conﬂuent MDA-MB-231 cells grown for 48 h in 150 mm cell culturedishes with DMEM containing FBS depleted of bovine serum extracellular vesicles (EVs) by 24 h ultracentrifugation at 120,000 3g.Cell-conditioned medium was collected from approximately 90% conﬂuent DiFi and SW620 cells grown for 48 h in 150 mm cellculture dishes with DMEM without FBS. Cell viability was assessed using trypan blue exclusion and only medium from cultureswith > 95% viability was used for isolation of EVs. Cell-conditioned medium was collected from approximately 95% conﬂuent primaryhuman kidney epithelial cells grown for 96 h in cell culture ﬂasks with DMEM without FBS. The collected media was ﬁrst subjected to acentrifugation step of 400 3gfor 10 min at RT to pellet and remove cells. All following centrifugation steps were performed at 4/C14C.
/C14C.Next, the supernatant was spun at 2,000 3gfor 20 min to remove debris and apoptotic bodies. Then, to pellet and collect large EVs(lEVs), the supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 3gfor 40 min. The resulting lEV pellet (P15) was resuspended in a large volume ofphosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by ultracentrifugation at 15,000 3gfor 40 min to wash the sample. To remove anyremaining any lEVs, the media supernatant from the ﬁrst 15,000 3gstep was passed through a 0.22 mm pore PES ﬁlter (Millipore).This supernatant (pre-cleared medium) was next subjected to ultracentrifugation at 120,000 3gfor 4 h in a SW 32 Ti Rotor SwingingBucket rotor ( kfactor of 204, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) to sediment small EVs (sEVs). The crude sEV pellet (P120) wasresuspended in a large volume of PBS followed by ultracentrifugation at 120,000 3gfor 4 h to wash the sample. At no time duringthe process were samples subjected to temperatures below 4/C14C.
Extracellular vesicle isolation from cultured cells grown in bioreactorsDKO-1 and Gli36 cells were maintained in CELLine Adhere 1000 (CLAD1000) bioreactors (INTEGRA Biosciences AG, Zizers,Switzerland) at 37/C14C in a 5% CO 2humidiﬁed incubator, essentially as previously described ( Jeppesen et al., 2014b; Mitchellet al., 2008 ). Cell-conditioned medium was harvested from bioreactors every 48 h, starting from one week after inoculation of thebioreactor and continuing for a period of 4 weeks. Pellets of lEVs (P15) and sEVs (P120) were generated as described. At no timeduring the process were samples subjected to temperatures below 4/C14C.Extracellular vesicle isolation from human plasma samplesBlood was drawn into BD Vacutainer Blood Collection Tubes (BD Bioscience) containing either Acid Citrate Dextrose Solution A or
Buffered Sodium Citrate as anticoagulants. The ﬁrst tube drawn was discarded. Further processing of samples was initiated within20 min of blood draw. Plasma was generated by ﬁrst centrifugation of the blood at 3000 3gfor 15 min and then a second round ofcentrifugation of the supernatant at 3000 3gfor 15 min tube to ensure that no platelets remained (see also Figure S3 D). The resulting
centrifugation of the supernatant at 3000 3gfor 15 min tube to ensure that no platelets remained (see also Figure S3 D). The resultingplasma samples were immediately diluted /C241:20 in ice cold PBS and spun at 15,000 x g for 40 min to pellet and remove lEVs andmicroparticles. The supernatant was ﬁltered through a 0.22 mm pore PES ﬁlter (Millipore). Clariﬁed supernatants were subjectedto ultracentrifugation at 120,000 3gfor 4 h in a SW 32 Ti Swinging Bucket rotor to sediment sEVs. Pellets of crude sEVs (P120)were resuspended in ice-cold PBS, tubes were ﬁlled with PBS, and then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 120,000 3gfor 4 h.The washed pellet was resuspended again and subjected to a second wash step, again at 120,000 3gfor 4 h. The washed pelletwas resuspended in ice-cold PBS. Crude plasma sEV samples were further puriﬁed by high-resolution iodixanol density gradients
fractionation (see below and Figure S3 D). At no time during the process were plasma or plasma sEVs subjected to temperaturesbelow 4/C14C.Extracellular vesicle isolation from human tissue samplesCrude sEVs were isolated from the interstitial space/tumor microenvironment of human tissue as previously established ( Asai et al.,2015; Vella et al., 2017 ), with some modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, immediately after resection, fresh tumor or adjacent normal tissue wasdissected on ice. The pieces of tissue were then incubated at 37/C14C in 250 units/ml Collagenase type I (Worthington, Lake Wood,NJ, USA) for 30 min after which the tissue was returned to ice and diluted with PBS containing Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cock-tail and PhosSTOP Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (both from Roche). The solution of tissue was gently disassociated by pipetting(10 mL pipette). After dissociation, the sample was applied to ﬁrst a 60 mm then a 40 mm mesh ﬁlter (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
Cell 177, 428–445.e1–e8, April 4, 2019 e4
CA, USA) to remove any remaining larger particles from the single-cell suspension. The supernatant containing disassociated cells andextracellular vesicles was spun at 400 x gfor 10 min to pellet cells. The cell pellet was washed once in PBS by resuspension and re-pelleting, and cellular proteins extracted as described below. Crude sEVs (P120) were then puriﬁed from the supernatant in the samemanner as described above for cell culture sEVs. At no time during the process were samples subjected to temperatures below 4/C14C.Protein extraction from cells, large EVs and small EVsTo extract cellular proteins, cultured cells and cells isolated from disaggregated colorectal tissues were collected, washed twice withice-cold PBS, and solubilized in cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X,2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4,1mg/ml leupeptin, 60 mM octyl b-D-glucopyranoside)
to which complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (both from Roche), and 2.0 mMPefabloc (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) was added immediately before use. Lysed samples were incubated on ice for30 min. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 10,000 3ga t4/C14C to remove cellular debris. Protein content of cell lysates was quantiﬁedby a Direct Detect Infrared Spectrometer (Millipore). After the ﬁnal wash step of ultracentrifugation in PBS, lEV (P15) and sEV (P120)samples were lysed, and proteins extracted as described above for cell samples.Immunoblot analysisSamples of lysed cells, lEVs and sEVs-exosomes were prepared in lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) sample buffer, heated to 70/C14C for10 min, or incubated at room temperature for 30 min, before being loaded on gels. The samples were separated on 4%–12% or 12%SDS-PAGE Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies) under either reducing or non-reducing conditions, depending on the subsequent use of
primary antibody, before being transferred to Immobilon-FL PVDF Transfer Membranes (EMD-Millipore). Membranes were blockedfor 1 h in 5% non-fat dry milk, 5% bovine serum albumin, or Odyssey TBS Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA),depending on the primary antibody subsequently used. Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting are described in Table S10. Forchemiluminescence detection of proteins, HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-rat IgG H&L (Abcam) andanti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling Technology) secondary antibodies, and Western Lightning Plus-ECL Substrate (PerkinElmer) wereused. For ﬂuorescence detection of proteins, IRDye 680RD anti-mouse IgG (H+L), Highly Cross Adsorbed, IRDye 800CW anti-rabbitIgG (H+L), Highly Cross Adsorbed and IRDye 800CW anti-rat IgG (H+L), Highly Cross Adsorbed (LI-COR) secondary antibodies were
used. Detection was with an Odyssey Fc Imaging System (LI-COR). Relative protein levels were determined using Image Studiosoftware (LI-COR).High-resolution (12%–36%) iodixanol density gradient fractionationIodixanol (OptiPrep) density media (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) were prepared in ice-cold PBS immediately before use togenerate discontinuous step (12%–36%) gradients. Crude pellets of sEVs (P120) were resuspended in ice-cold PBS and mixedwith ice-cold iodixanol/PBS for a ﬁnal 36% iodixanol solution. The suspension was added to the bottom of a centrifugation tubeand solutions of descending concentrations of iodixanol in PBS were carefully layered on top yielding the complete gradient.Identical gradients without sample were generated in the same manner for later determination of fraction densities (Figure S1A).The bottom-loaded 12%–36% gradients were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 120,000 3gfor 15 h at 4/C14C using a SW41 TI Swing-

/C14C using a SW41 TI Swing-ing Bucket rotor ( kfactor of 124, Beckman Coulter). Twelve individual fractions of 1 mL were collected from the top of the gradient.From the duplicate gradient, fraction densities were measured using a refractometer (ATAGO, Tokyo, Japan). For NanoparticleTracking Analysis (NTA), fractions were pooled and diluted in particle-free PBS. For immunoblotting, each individual 1 mL fractionwas transferred to new ultracentrifugation tubes, diluted 12-fold in PBS and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 120,000 3gfor4 h at 4/C14C using a SW41 TI swinging bucket rotor. The resulting pellets were lysed in cell lysis buffer (see below) for 30 minon ice. For RNA and DNA extraction, fractions were pooled, transferred to new ultracentrifugation tubes, diluted approximately6-fold in PBS and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 120,000 3gfor 4 h at 4/C14C using a SW 32 Ti Swinging Bucket rotor.6%–30% iodixanol density gradient fractionation
6%–30% iodixanol density gradient fractionationCrude pellets of sEVs (P120) were resuspended in ice-cold PBS and mixed with ice-cold iodixanol/PBS for a ﬁnal 30% iodixanolsolution. The suspension was added to the bottom of a centrifugation tube and solutions of descending concentration of iodixanolin PBS were carefully layered on top yielding the complete gradient. Identical gradients without sample were generated in the samemanner for later determination of fraction densities (Figure S5A). The bottom-loaded 6%–30% gradients were subjected to ultracen-trifugation at 120,000 3gfor 15 h at 4/C14C using a SW41 TI Swinging Bucket rotor. Ten individual fractions of 1 mL were collected fromthe top of the gradient.Particle size and concentration measurement by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA)
Samples in solution were analyzed by nanoparticle tracking using a NanoSight LM10 system (NanoSight Ltd, Amesbury, UK) conﬁg-ured with a 405 nm laser and a high sensitivity sCMOS camera (OrcaFlash2.8, Hamamatsu C11440, NanoSight Ltd). Prior to analysis,samples were either treated with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma) ( Osteikoetxea et al., 2015 ) for 10 min at RT, or mock treated (control).Analysis using NTA software (version 2.3, build 0006 beta 2) was essentially as previously described ( Jeppesen et al., 2014a, 2014b ).In brief, each sample of particles was diluted in particle-free PBS, and introduced manually. After optimization, settings were kepte5Cell 177, 428–445.e1–e8, April 4, 2019
constant between measurements for that session. Ambient temperature was recorded manually and did not exceed 25/C14C. Approx-imately 20-40 particles were in the ﬁeld of view and the typical concentration was approximately 2 3108to 83108particles/mlfor each measurement. Six videos of 60 s duration, with a 10 s delay between measurements, were recorded for each independentreplicate (n = 3), generating data for each sample type that is the average of 18 individual measurements.Negative stain transmission electron microscopyWith ﬁxationSamples were ﬁrst ﬁxed with 2.5% gluteraldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer at RT for 30 min. Samples were then depositedon formvar carbon-coated grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatﬁeld, PA) for 1 min followed by negative staining with 2% uranylacetate for 30 s at RT. Imaging was performed on a Philips/FEI T-12 Transmission Electron Microscope. Micrographs were captured
with a 2k x 2k CCD camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Woburn, MA). TEM was performed in part through the use of theVanderbilt Cell Imaging Shared Resource (supported by NIH grants CA68485, DK20593, DK58404, DK59637 and EY08126).Without ﬁxation (for imaging of vault structures)Partially puriﬁed and highly puriﬁed exosome fractions (usually 0.2-0.5 mg/ml total protein concentration) were prepared for trans-mission electron microscopy (TEM) by absorption of samples onto 1-2 nm thick carbon ﬁlm mounted on carbon-coated holey-ﬁlmgrids for 5 min at 4/C14C. This was accomplished by ﬂoating the grid on 25 mL of sample. Following sample adsorption, grids were quicklyand gently blotted on ﬁlter paper and immediately ﬂoated for 5 min on 1 mL of 1% uranyl acetate at 4/C14C and dried on ﬁlter paper.Imaging was performed on a JEM 1200EX microscope. Micrographs were captured with a BioScan 600W digital camera (Gatan,Pleasanton, CA) using Gatan’s DigitalMicrograph software.
In all cases, TEM was performed on fresh sample of EVs that had not been subjected to freezing temperatures at any step inpuriﬁcation or processing.Mass spectrometry and data analysisSamples were re-suspended in 100 mL of triﬂuoroethanol (TFE) and 100 mL of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8. Samples weresonicated three times for 20 s with 30 s incubation on ice in between. The resulting homogenate was heated with shaking at 1000 rpmfor 1 h at 60/C14C followed by a second series of sonication steps. Protein content of samples was measured and two aliquots of 100 mg(two process replicates per sample) was reduced with 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 60/C14C for 30 min followed by alkylation with100 mM iodoacetamide (IAM) in the dark at room temperature for 20 min. The lysate was diluted with the appropriate volume of50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, to reduce the TFE concentration to 10%. Trypsin was added at a ratio of 1:50 (w:w) and
digestion allowed to proceed overnight at 37/C14C. The digested mixture was frozen at /C080/C14C and lyophilized to dryness. The lyophilizedsamples were re-suspended in 350 mL of HPLC-grade water and vortexed vigorously for 1 min followed by desalting using an OasisHLB 96-well mElution plate (30 mm, 5 mg, Waters, Milford, MA) pre-washed with 500 mL of acetonitrile and equilibrated with 750 mLo fHPLC-grade water. Flow-through was discarded, plates washed with 500 mL of HPLC-grade water, and peptides eluted with 80%acetonitrile followed by vacuum drying and reconstitution using 2% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid.Peptides from each replicate were analyzed in three technical replicates on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer equipped with anEasy nLC-1000 (Thermo Scientiﬁc). A 2 mL injection volume of peptides was separated on a PicoFrit (New Objective, Woburn,MA) column (75 mm ID x 120 mm, 10 mm ID tip) packed with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ resin (3 mm particle size and 120 A ˚pore size).
Peptides were eluted using a ﬂow rate of 300 nL/min, and the mobile phase solvents consisted of water containing 0.1% formic
Peptides were eluted using a ﬂow rate of 300 nL/min, and the mobile phase solvents consisted of water containing 0.1% formicacid (solvent [A]) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (solvent [B]). A 155 min gradient was performed, consisting of thefollowing: 0 /C010 min, increase to 5% B; 10 /C040 min, 5 /C010% B; 40-140 min, 35% B, 140-145 min, 90% B and held at 90% B for5 min before returning to the initial conditions of 2% B. Mass spectra were acquired over the scan range of m/z300-1800 at aresolution of 70,000 (AGC target 3 x106and 64 ms maximum injection time). Data-dependent scans of the top 20 most abundantions were selected for fragmentation with HCD using an isolation width of 2 m/z, 27% normalized collision energy and a resolutionof 35,000 (AGC target 2 x105and 100 ms maximum injection time). Dynamic exclusion was set to 60 s.Tandem spectra were searched against the human RefSeq database (v. 3.56) using the Myrimatch algorithm (v 1.6.75) and MS
GF+. The database incorporated both the forward and reversed sequences to allow for determination of false discovery rate(FDR). The searches were performed allowing a static modiﬁcation of +57 on cysteine (for carboxyamidomethylation from iodoace-tamide) and dynamic modiﬁcations of +16 on methionine (oxidation). Semi-tryptic peptides were considered in the search parame-ters. Peptide and fragment ion tolerances were set to ±0.01 and 0.5 Da, respectively. The data were ﬁltered and assembled with theIDPicker algorithm (v. 2.6.165) using a 5% FDR for all peptides with parsimony applied (minimum protein reporting) and requiring atleast two peptides (minimum peptide length of seven amino acids). Spectral count differences between samples were analyzed usingQuasiTel of using a quasiFDR value of < 0.05 and requiring at least a 4-fold change in expression.RNA extraction from cells, large EVs and small EVs, and RNA analysis
RNA was extracted using miRCURY RNA Isolation Cell and Plant Kit (Exiqon, 300110) according to the manufacturer’s protocol withelution in a volume of 50 ml. RNA was quantiﬁed and 260/280 ratio assessed using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientiﬁc), and Qubit2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, CA, USA). Proﬁles of RNA species present in samples were generated using AgilentRNA Nano 6000 and Agilent RNA Pico 6000 kits on a 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument (Agilent Technologies).Cell 177, 428–445.e1–e8, April 4, 2019 e6
Short RNA library preparation and sequencingAll RNA sequencing was performed at Hudson Alpha (Huntsville, Al, USA) under the direction of Shawn E. Levy and Nripesh Prasad.Short RNA libraries were prepared using NEBNext Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA,USA). Brieﬂy, 30adapters were ligated to total input RNA followed by hybridization of multiplex single read (SR) reverse transcription(RT) primers and ligation of multiplex 50SR adapters. RT was performed using ProtoScript II RT for 1 h at 50/C14C. Immediately after RTreactions, ampliﬁcation was performed for 15 PCR cycles using LongAmp Taq 2 3master mix with Illumina-indexed primers to
uniquely barcode each sample. The puriﬁed material was size selected for 146–148 bp range using 3% dye-free agarose gelcassettes on a Pippin Prep instrument (Sage Science, Beverly, MA, USA). Post-PCR material was puriﬁed using QIAquick PCRpuriﬁcation kits (QIAGEN) and the yield and concentration of the prepared libraries were assessed using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, CA, USA) and DNA 1000 chips on a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad,CA, USA), respectively. For sequencing, library quantiﬁcation was performed using qPCR-based KAPA Biosystems Library Quanti-ﬁcation kits (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA, USA). Each library was diluted to a ﬁnal concentration of 1.25 nM and pooled inequimolar ratios prior to clustering. Cluster generation was carried out on a cBot v8.0 using an Illumina Truseq Single Read Cluster
Kit v3.0. Single-end sequencing was performed to generate at least 15 million reads per sample on an Illumina HiSeq2000 using a50-cycleTruSeq SBSHSv3 reagent kit (50 bp single-end reads). Clustered ﬂow cells were sequenced for 56 cycles, consisting of a50-cycle read, followed by a 6-cycle index read. Image analysis and base calling were performed using the standard Illumina pipelineconsisting of Real Time Analysis version v1.17 and demultiplexed using bcl2fastq converter with default settings.Long RNA library preparation and sequencingFor long RNA library preparation, a Ribo-zero Magnetic Gold rRNA removal kit (Epicenter, IIlumina) was used to remove ribosomalRNA from the total RNA. First-strand synthesis was performed using NEBNext RNA ﬁrst-strand synthesis module (New EnglandBioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Immediately thereafter, directional second-strand synthesis was performed using NEBNExt Ultra
Directional second-strand synthesis kit. Following this, cDNAs were used for standard library preparation protocol using NEBNextDNA Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina. End-repair was performed followed by polyA addition and custom adaptor ligation.After ligation, material was individually barcoded with unique in-house genomics service lab primers. Library quality and concentra-tion were assessed by a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and DNA 1000 chips on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Accurate quantiﬁcation forsequencing applications was determined using the qPCR-based KAPA Biosystems Library Quantiﬁcation kit (Kapa Biosystems,Woburn, MA). Each library was diluted to a ﬁnal concentration of 12.5 nM and pooled equimolar prior to clustering. Paired-endsequencing was performed on all samples (100 bp paired-end directional reads). Raw reads were de-multiplexed using a bcl2fastqconversion software v1.8.3 (Illumina) with default settings.Direct Immunoafﬁnity Capture (DIC) of exosomes
Direct Immunoafﬁnity Capture (DIC) of exosomesImmediately after collection, cell-conditioned medium was subjected to differential centrifugation at 400 x g, 2,000 x gand 15,000 x gat 4/C14C. The supernatant was ﬁltered through a 0.22 mm pore PES ﬁlter (Millipore) to generate pre-cleared medium. All following stepswere also performed at 4/C14C. Pre-cleared medium was split three ways, one portion were incubated with magnetic beads directlyconjugated to anti-mouse antibodies directed at CD63, CD81 or CD9 (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc), one portion incubated with magnetic
conjugated to anti-mouse antibodies directed at CD63, CD81 or CD9 (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc), one portion incubated with magneticbeads conjugated to mouse IgG, and incubation was allowed to proceed with nutation and rotation for 16 h ( Figure 4 A). The thirdportion was subjected to ultracentrifugation and washing to generate a crude sEV pellet as described above (P120). After incubation,the beads were washed four times in ice-cold 0.1% BSA-PBS (pH 7.4, ﬁltered through a 0.22 mm membrane), and ﬁnally, washed onetime in PBS pH 7.4 (pH 7.4, ﬁltered through a 0.22 mm membrane). Immediately following the last wash, the exosome-loaded beadswere resuspended ﬁrst in cell lysis buffer and LDS sample buffer for 30 min on ice, and then resuspended in LDS sample buffer fol-lowed by heating to 70/C14C for 10 min to release proteins. The beads were removed from the suspension by using a magnet and the
clariﬁed lysate used for immunoblot analysis. In some cases, immediately following the last wash step, the exosome-loaded beadswere lysed for DNA extraction ( Figure S6 E and see below). DIC of exosomes directly from human plasma was performed asdescribed above except that the supernatant in these cases was raw, undiluted and unﬁltered, plasma (generated by two roundsof 3000 x gcentrifugation for 15 min).DNA extraction and analysisSmall EV samples were generated by iodixanol density gradient fractionation as described above and pooled fractions were resus-pended in PBS for DNA extraction. For some experiments, samples were either pre-treated for 30 min with DNase I (New EnglandBiolabs) at 50 U/ml in reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 2.5mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl 2), or mock treated in reaction buffer, followed byDNase I deactivation. Extraction of DNA was performed using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions for cultured cells. Elution of DNA was in 100 ml of elution buffer. For some experiments, extracted DNA was treatedwith either RNase A/T1 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) at 100 mg/ml RNase A and 250 U/ml RNase T1, or DNase I (New England Biolabs) at200U/ml in reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 2.5mM MgCl 2, 0.5 mM CaCl 2). DNA concentrations were measured by a NanoDrop 2000spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) and a Qubit 3.0 ﬂuorometer using Qubit dsDNA HS and dsDNA BR kits (Thermo FisherScientiﬁc). Presence of contaminating RNA was assessed using the Qubit ﬂuorometer with a Qubit RNA HS kit. The size of puriﬁedDNA was evaluated with microﬂuidic High Sensitivity DNA kits on a Bioanalyzer 2100 instrument (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).e7Cell 177, 428–445.e1–e8, April 4, 2019
For DNA extraction from magnetic bead-capture experiments, conditioned-media from DKO-1 and Gli36 cells in culture weresubjected ﬁrst to pre-clearing of larger vesicles and debris as described above, and then incubated with anti-CD81- or IgG-beadsovernight at 4/C14C under rotation and tilting. Beads were collected and washed as described above. The ﬂowthrough from captureexperiments was subjected to 120,000 g ultracentrifugation for 4 h, resuspended and washed in PBS with another round of120,000 g ultracentrifugation to pellet sEVs. Both beads and ﬂowthrough sEV pellets were lysed and DNA extracted asdescribed above.Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM)3D SIM imaging and processing were performed on a Nikon N-SIM structured illumination platform equipped with an Andor DU-897EMCCD camera and a SR Apo TIRF 100X (1.49 NA, WD 0.12) oil immersion objective. Samples were imaged in PBS at RT. For
calibration, 100 nm ﬂuorescent (360/430 nm, 505/515 nm, 560/580 nm and 660/680 nm) beads (TetraSpeck Microspheres, ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) were ﬁxed and imaged. Images were analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes ofHealth, Bethesda, MD, USA). SIM was performed in part through the use of the Vanderbilt University Nikon Center of Excellence.Immunoﬂuorescence stainingCells prepared for SIM were cultured on 35-mm culture dishes with 1.5 coverslip and 14 mm glass diameter (P35G-0.170-14-C,MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA, USA) to approximately 50% conﬂuence. DKO-1 cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde inPBS at room temperature for 20 min and then extracted for 5 min with 1% Triton X-100 in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS as previouslydescribed ( Fenix et al., 2016 ). Cells were washed three times in PBS. Cells were blocked in 10% BSA in PBS. Primary antibodies werediluted in 10% BSA and incubation was overnight at 4
/C14C. Cells were washed three times. The secondary Alexa Flour antibodies wereprepared in blocking buffer and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min before incubation on cells for 1 h at room temperature.QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSISStatistical analyses were performed using the SPSS Statistical Analysis System (version 22.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL) and R (The R foun-dation). Normal distribution of datasets was assessed by Shapiro-Wilks test, skewness and kurtosis, and visual inspection of Q-Qplots. Equality of variance was tested by Levene’s test. Sphericity was assessed where appropriate by Mauchly’s test. All dataare presented as mean ±SD unless otherwise stated. To assess differences between two groups, two-tailed unpaired Student’st test was performed. When three or more groups were compared, one-way ANOVA was performed for an overall difference. If sig-
niﬁcant, this was followed by multiple comparisons with signiﬁcance between groups corrected by the Holm-Bonferroni procedure.Differences were considered to be signiﬁcant for values of p < 0.05. For RNA-seq and mass spectrometry data, the false discoveryrate for multiple comparisons was controlled with the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. For mass spectrometry, the spectral countdifferences between samples were considered to be signiﬁcant for quasiFDR values of p < 0.05 (see above).DATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITYDatasets for RNA-seq have been deposited in GEO: GSE125905.Cell 177, 428–445.e1–e8, April 4, 2019 e8
