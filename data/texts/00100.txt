subjects (suntanned and non-suntanned individuals) and subjectsaffected by abnormally high sensitivity to solar exposure. Asecond aim of the study was to search for a possible relationamong biological markers of individual response to UV exposure(such as skin colorimetric parameters, skin temperature andchanges in free radical amounts [FR] in the blood) andphotosensitivity. FR in the blood were analyzed because of theirpossible inﬂuence on UV carcinogenesis. Measurements ofambient doses ( i.e.incident erythemally weighted irradiance ona horizontal surface over a speciﬁed period of time) anderythemally effective UV dose received by an anatomical site(here called personal dose or exposure on a speciﬁc anatomicalsite) were investigated. Personal doses received by the chest weredetermined using polysulfone dosimetry. Exposure Ratio (ER),deﬁned as the ratio between the personal dose and the corre-sponding ambient dose during the same exposure period, was
then calculated. Measuring of skin color in the CommissionInternationale de l’Eclairage L* (luminance), a* (redness), b*(yellowness) system and skin temperature were also carried outon the inner upper arm (nonexposed skin site) and on the chest. Itwas found that the median value of ER was 0.20 (min: 0.09 andmax: 0.34) for suntanned individuals, it was 0.17 (min: 0.13 andmax: 0.42) for non-suntanned individuals and it was 0.19 (min:0.14 and max: 0.34) for photosensitive individuals. There were nosigniﬁcant differences across the groups in their median ERscores. In addition, the statistical analysis showed that L* on theexposed site before exposure demonstrated consistently highermedian scores after exposure in all groups. The b* value afterexposure was signiﬁcantly lower than before exposure in allparticipants, while no signiﬁcant differences for a* were observedbefore or after exposure between or within the groups. Ourﬁndings suggest that photodermatoses are not signiﬁcantly
related to ER and to the changes in biological markers due totoo short-term UV exposure.INTRODUCTIONThe relationship between UV radiation and its subsequentbiological effects has been studied for several years (1). Overthe last two decades interest in this topic has increased as aresult of ﬁndings on the stratospheric ozone downward trend,and the likely consequent increase of solar UV irradiance atthe Earth’ surface.Despite the fact that the amount of solar UV radiationreaching the Earth’s surface comprises only a few percent ofglobal radiation, approximately 6–7% in the UVA (320–400 nm) region and less than 1% in the UVB band (280–320 nm), current evidence suggests that it is the majorcausative factor in several short- and long-term skin and eyesdiseases (2,3). The short-term effects on the skin includeerythema, photodermatoses, immunosuppression and photo-toxicity ⁄photoallergy, while the long-term ones include skincancers and malignant melanoma (4). Additionally, UVB is
erythema, photodermatoses, immunosuppression and photo-toxicity ⁄photoallergy, while the long-term ones include skincancers and malignant melanoma (4). Additionally, UVB isresponsible for tanning, photoaging and wrinkling (3). Withregard to eye pathologies, photoretinitis and photokeratocon-junctivitis are acute effects, while cataract is the most severechronic disease (1). The only well-established positive humaneffect from a moderate degree of UV exposure is the synthesisof vitamin D3 required for skeletal health (5,6). Recently, therehas been increasing debate within the scientiﬁc communityregarding the health duality of UV radiation (7). Variousarticles have suggested that low vitamin D can be considered arisk factor for breast, prostate and colon cancers (8–10). Oneof the Australian authors is currently focusing on the positiveand negative effects of UV radiation on human health toquantify the correct UV exposure of populations (11).
The degree of effectiveness of UV radiation in producing abiological effect depends on the ‘‘biologically effective solarexposure’’ or ‘‘biologically effective dose,’’ i.e.the incidentweighted irradiance on a given surface over a speciﬁed periodof time, expressed in Joules per square meter, Jm)2(12).Assessing this radiometric quantity requires knowledge ofaction spectra of each biological system, i.e.the effectiveness ofthe electromagnetic radiation in causing a speciﬁc reactionwithin the biological system. The main action spectra whichhave been used in a wide range of studies are DNA damage,erythema, squamous cell carcinoma in mice, malignant mel-anoma in ﬁsh and plant damage (13–17).*Corresponding author email: annamaria.siani@uniroma1.it (Anna MariaSiani)/C2112008 The Authors.

The quantiﬁcation of human UV exposure is indeed acomplex issue as it is directly linked to ambient UV radiation(i.e.on horizontal surface) as well as to behavioral and culturalfactors of individuals. This means that even in areas ofrelatively low ambient UV radiation it is possible to experiencehigh personal UV exposure. Godar (4) showed that UVexposure ranges between 5% and 15% of total ambient UVdose and in outdoor workers can reach up to 20–30%; peopleof the same age tend to receive a similar percentage of ambientUV dose in different locations, with males experiencing higherUV exposure than females.Personal exposure to UV radiation can be measured usingphysical, chemical or biological dosimeters. A dosimeter iscalibrated in physical units against another instrument thatmeasures UV radiation ( e.g.a spectroradiometer or a broad-band radiometer). Broadband radiometers that have anerythemal response yield measures of the ambient erythemal
UV irradiance (dose rate) between 280 and 400 nm. Spectralirradiance undertaken with a spectroradiometer and thenconvolved with the Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage(C.I.E.) erythema action spectrum can provide an alternativeway to quantify the ambient UV dose rate (14). Bothinstruments provide levels of UV radiation on a horizontalplane.Personal dosimeters studies documenting UV exposure weremainly performed in Australia (18–20). In Europe, skin cancercaused by solar UV radiation is a growing problem and theassessment of sun exposure is still under investigation. To citebut a few, Diffey et al. (21) conducted a study to assess outdoorUV exposure of young people in three different regions ofEngland using polysulfone (PS) dosimetry; Boldemann et al.(22) carried out measurements of children’s exposure in twooutdoor environments using Biotechnical spore dosimeters;Thieden et al. (23) monitored UV exposure of Irish and Danish
gardeners over a 4-month summer period during work andleisure activity by means of diaries and personal electronicdosimeters. A review on studies of measurements and assess-ment of childhood and adolescent UV exposure during theiractivities was performed by Wright and Reeder (24).The aims of the present study were: (1) To assess UVexposure of sunbathers in the Italian population in terms ofexposure ratio (ER) ( i.e.the fraction of the ambient UVradiation received by each sunbather); (2) To investigate ifsystematic differences in solar exposure exist between healthysubjects and subjects affected by abnormally high sensitivity tothe solar exposure (photodermatoses); and (3) To investigatethe presence, if any, of a relationship between UV doses andchanges in biological indicators. For this reason, colorimetricparameters, skin temperature and free radical (FR) amountsbefore and after exposure were used as markers of individualresponse to UV exposure.MATERIALS AND METHODS
response to UV exposure.MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy location. The ﬁeld experiment was carried out on 27 May 2005 onthe beach at Fregene (Latitude 41.8 /C176N, Longitude 12.2 /C176E, 0 m a.s.l.), apopular seaside location in central Italy, about 30 km west of Rome in atypical radiative scenario (anticyclonic windless weather conditions).Study participants. To investigate the differences in solar exposurebetween healthy subjects and subjects affected by abnormally highsensitivity to the solar exposure (photodermatoses), the volunteerswere recruited by means of an advertisement at the Physics Depart-ment of Sapienza University of Rome and at the Photo-TherapyLaboratory of the IFO S. Gallicano Hospital of Rome. Volunteerswere selected by researchers of both teams on the basis of the following
design criteria: group 1, individuals already suntanned; group 2,individuals with no previous exposure—non-suntanned; group 3,individuals with an abnormally high sensitivity to their ﬁrst UVexposure. All information was obtained interviewing each volunteerand conﬁrmed by the diagnosis of a dermatologist of the Photo-
Therapy Laboratory. In addition, the dermatologist, on the basis ofthe observation of hair and eye colors and skin pigmentation,diagnosed the phototype of each individual according to the classiﬁ-cation of Fitzpatrick skin types (25).The participants performed their ordinary sunbathing habitsduring the campaign without being affected by the use of PSdosimeters.Participation was on a voluntary basis and the study wasconducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki(2000).Study protocol. The volunteers gathered on the beach and wereasked to follow their usual sunbathing habits. Participants completed aquestionnaire (Appendix) during the exposure. The questionnaire wascomposed of three parts: (Part A) description of activity within eachhalf-hour period and body posture; (Part B) time intervals spent in theshade; and (Part C) general questions to ﬁnd out if the sun exposure ofthat person on that day corresponded to his ⁄her usual sunbathing
habits and what the participant felt about weather of that day. Inaddition at the end of exposure the volunteers were asked if they usedsunscreen protection.Each participant was equipped with a PS dosimeter which wassecured to the chest using a pin (women) or a tape (men) (Fig. 1). Thisbody area was chosen in agreement with the dermatologist, since theﬁrst signs of photodermatoses frequently appear on the chest. Inaddition, measurements of colorimetric parameters and of skin tem-perature were carried out. The protocols of these are described below.The volunteers were monitored during their exposure by theresearchers of the Sapienza University of Rome and by the dermatol-ogist. Table 1 contains a summary of the participants’ characteristics.Furthermore 16 volunteers (ﬁve photosensitive individuals, six indi-viduals of group 1 and ﬁve of group 2) consented to a blood test for themeasure of FRs in the plasma the day before and 2 days after theirexposure.
exposure.Measurement of ambient UV doses. The erythemal dose (Jm)2)deﬁned as the incident erythemally weighted irradiance on a horizontalsurface (dose rate, Wm)2) over a speciﬁed period of time (12), is herecalled ambient dose. In this study, the C.I.E. erythemal actionspectrum (14) was considered.Figure 1. Position of the PS dosimeter during the experiment for women (left) and men (right).172 Anna Maria Siani et al. 17511097, 2009, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-1097.2008.00413.x by Cochrane Japan, Wiley Online Library on [26/09/2024].

Ambient doses were measured using the calibrated broadbandradiometer (model YES UVB-1; Yankee Environmental System, MA)belonging to the Solar Radiometry Observatory, Sapienza—Universityof Rome (26). The YES radiometer has a spectral response similar tothat of skin erythema and it provides the erythemal dose rate between280 and 400 nm at 1 min averages.This radiometer, normally situated in the University Campus, forthis ﬁeld experiment was installed on the roof of a building (4 m a.s.l.)directly on the beach where the sunbathers laid.Values of erythemal dose rates are obtained using a calibrationmatrix (27) as a function of solar zenith angle (SZA) and total ozoneamounts. The latter data were provided by Brewer spectrophotometer#067 located at the University Campus of Sapienza—University of
Rome. The ozone calibration is performed by the International OzoneServices, Inc. almost every 2 years. Periodic checks of the radiometer areperformed with reference to the Brewer spectrophotometer which isitself inter-compared with the traveling standard QASUME spectrora-diometer (28) from the PMOD ⁄WRC (Physikalisch-MeteorologischesObservatorium Davos; World Radiation Center) almost every 2 years.The uncertainty of broadband radiometer combined with theuncertainty of spectroradiometer is estimated to be 10%.Polysulfone dosimetry. In this study, PS dosimeters were used, as PSdosimetry is a widely tested methodology (29–32) for reliable quantiﬁ-cation of the erythemally effective UV dose received by an anatomicalsite (the incident erythemally weighted irradiance on an anatomical siteover a speciﬁed period of time, in Jm)2, hereafter called personal dose or
)2, hereafter called personal dose orexposure on a speciﬁc anatomical site). The use of PS dosimeters requiresdetermination of the calibration curve, i.e.ambient dose versus changein PS ﬁlm absorbance ( DA at 330 nm), before and after exposure, foreach ﬁeld experiment. The calibration curve is mainly dependent ontotal ozone and SZA (33). If the time interval of calibration is extendedto all daylight hours and under the assumption that total ozone amountremains approximately constant (as it usually is), the only factoraffecting spectral changes of solar irradiance is the SZA.The calibration curve is determined by exposing the PS dosimeterson a horizontal plane at speciﬁc time intervals and simultaneously bymeasuring the ambient UV dose, covering the entire range of SZAduring the time period of calibration.The curve is represented by a ﬁt to a third-degree polynomial and itcan be parameterized by a coefﬁcient multiplying a cubic polynomialfunction:D¼cðDAþDA2þ9DA3Þð 1Þ
D¼cðDAþDA2þ9DA3Þð 1Þwhere D(erythemal dose) is expressed in kJm)2.Dosimeters (from the same batch of those used during the ﬁeldcampaign) were exposed on a horizontal plane to solar UV radiation tocover the entire range of SZAs viewed from the dosimeter worn by thevolunteer. Dosimeters were removed at speciﬁc time intervals and atthe same time UV dose rates were measured by the nearby broadbandradiometer. The absorbance changes versus the corresponding ambientUV doses provided the calibration curve at the site.The uncertainty associated with doses, estimated by Eq. (1),depends on random errors, because systematic uncertainties areremoved when dosimeters have the same thickness (in thiscase 40 lm thick) and belong to the same batch (31). The uncertaintyonDwas estimated to be ±10% as derived from the error propagationformula taking into account an uncertainty of 0.001 on DA (31).Exposure ratio, deﬁned as the ratio between the personal dose on
the selected anatomical site (chest) and the corresponding ambientdose on a horizontal plane during the same exposure period, was takeninto account in the analysis. Personal doses are related to the PS
dosimeter worn by the volunteers and retrieved from the calibrationcurve. ER is hence the fraction of the ambient UV radiation receivedby each volunteer during the exposure time intervals. The measure ofER has the advantage of being independent from the environmentalparameters when it is used with reference to the same site, under thesame conditions and with the exposed subjects engaged in similarmovements ⁄activities (34).Measurements of biological indicators. Colorimetry: In the commonclinical practice it is quite difﬁcult to evaluate skin color changes, asindividual perception of color is complex and subjective. Severalstudies showed that both reﬂectance spectrophotometers and tri-stimulus colorimeters are very useful in the quantitative evaluation ofUV-induced erythema and pigmentation (35,36).The Minolta Spectrophotometer CM26000d was used in this study
since it is recommended for the objective evaluation of erythema (36).It is based on physical measurement of reﬂected light, through anintegrating sphere, at speciﬁc wavelengths (400–700 nm at 10 nmsteps) which correspond to the spectrum of visible light. Results aredisplayed as a graph showing reﬂectance versus wavelength. With thisinstrument it is possible to obtain colorimetric values in terms of: L*,luminance, which gives the relative brightness; a* (redness) value,which represents the balance between red (positive value) and green(negative value); b* (yellowness) value, which represents the balancebetween yellow (positive value) and blue (negative value). As recom-mended by the C.I.E.: the L* value ranges from total black ( L*=0 )to total white ( L* = 100). The range of a* and b* values is between)60 and +60.In this experiment, colorimetric measurements were carried outbefore and after exposure on a nonexposed skin site (inner upper part)
and on the chest. The values of nonexposed site were taken intoaccount as reference to verify the occurrence of any change in skinpigmentation not related to direct exposure. The changes in thecolorimetric parameters on the chest were used as possible markers ofindividual response to UV doses.Skin temperature: To discriminate the effects on human skin ofthe solar UV radiation and of the heat generated by infraredradiation or other causes, skin temperature measurements on thechest and on nonexposed skin areas were carried out before andafter exposure.A PT-3LF Portable Non-contact Thermometer (Optex, Japan) hasa ﬁeld of view of 30 ⁄1000 mm and it uses a sighting method based on acoaxial laser marker. Optics is made of a silicon lens and its sensingelement by a thermopile working in the range 8–14 lm. Its accuracy is±1% of reading value. It can work with the emissivity ratio ( e) from0.95 (dark bodies) to 0.70 (bright bodies).
0.95 (dark bodies) to 0.70 (bright bodies).The instrument, planned mainly for applications in electric wiring,motors and machines, freezers and refrigerators (http://www.optecs.co.jp) resulted in being fast (response after 1.5 s), safe and reliable(repeatability ±1 /C176C of reading value) also for its new use on humanbody. The instrument was tested in advance by the authors and noharmful effects were observed.This thermometer was used for the ﬁrst time in the context of theﬁeld experiment and the same procedure of colorimetric measurementsfollowed.Free radicals: Free radicals in the blood were analyzed because oftheir possible inﬂuence on UV carcinogenesis (37,38).A portable, FR determination system called D-Roms test (byDiacron, Grosseto, Italy) was recently developed by Cesarone et al.(39). The D-Roms test provides a simple, inexpensive andTable 1. Characteristics of the volunteers involved in the ﬁeld campaign.GroupSubjectsAge median(min–max)PhototypeMales

practical method to identify subjects with a high level of oxidativestress and to demonstrate the effect of any treatment or additivestress.The D-Roms test is based on the ability of transition metals tocatalyze in the presence of peroxides with formation of FRs which aretrapped by an alchilamine. Reference values of FRs in Carratelli Unitsare reported in Cesarone et al. (39).Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using the StatisticalPackage for Social Sciences (SPSS) software v14.0. The nonparametricKruskall–Wallis test (K–W) was used as an alternative one-waybetween-groups analysis of variance to test for differences of themedian scores across sunbather groups (40). The Wilcoxon SignedRank Test was used as a nonparametric alternative to the repeatedmeasures t-test to test for differences within groups (41) of themeasures of L*,a*,b* and Tpre and post sun exposure. The strength
of the relationship between the continuous variables was investigatedusing Spearman’s Rank correlation for nonparametric data. The rangefor a weak correlation was deﬁned as zero to 0.29; a moderatecorrelation from 0.30 to 0.49; and a large correlation was deﬁned as0.50 or greater (42). Statistical signiﬁcance was set at P£0.05 (two-tailed) for all analyses.RESULTSAmbient dosesExposures lasted from 11:20 A.M. until 01:34 P.M. local time(LT), for a maximum time interval of 134 min. The dose ratesmeasured by the radiometer are expressed as the UV index,ambient dose rate divided by 25 mWm)2(43). UV indexranged from the minimum of 6.28 at 11:20 A.M. LT to themaximum of 7.68 at 01:30 P.M. LT. In May, the mean UVindex is 6.63 ± 0.12 at Rome (44). The highest UV indexesmay depend on the different environmental conditions of theexperimental site. The cumulative ambient UV dose during theexperiment was 1468 Jm)2.Personal dosesThe calibration curve was determined with a cvalue of
(0.63 ± 0.01) kJm)2. A summary of the results for each groupin terms of median, minimum and maximum valuesof exposure time, personal dose and ambient dose are reportedin Table 2.Information of the time spent in the shade, of percentage ofsunbather postures (standing, lying, sitting and bent) duringexposure, also indicated in Table 2, was gained from thequestionnaire. The suntanned group were exposed for 114 min(min: 72 and max: 134) corresponding to a median doseof 258.7 Jm)2(min: 99.7 and max: 420.1), as derived fromdosimeters, non-suntanned individuals for 111 min (min: 70and max: 134) to a median dose of 236.3 Jm)2(min: 121.4 andmax: 477.4). The exposure time of photosensitive sunbatherswas 104 min (min: 60 and max: 134) with a dose of 203.5 Jm)2(min: 116.2 and max: 324.3).Exposure ratioThe median value of ER (ﬁrst row of Table 4) is 0.20 (min:0.09 and max: 0.34) for suntanned individuals, for non-
suntanned individuals the median is 0.17 (min: 0.13 and max:0.42) and for photosensitive individuals is 0.19 (min: 0.14 andmax: 0.34). There were no signiﬁcant differences across thegroups in their median ERs scores.ColorimetryExamination of the L*,a* and b* of nonexposed site beforeexposure demonstrated no signiﬁcant differences (Table 3) inthe median scores across the groups, as expected. Only thenon-suntanned group has signiﬁcantly lower median of theparameter a*(a* = 5.7) than the suntanned group ( a* = 6.8)and the photosensitive group ( a* = 6.5). In addition, it wasnoticed that L*,a* and b* values of nonexposed site did notdiffer before and after exposure.The results of the analysis of the ER and colorimetricparameters of the sun-exposed site for the three groups beforeand after exposure are reported in Table 4. There aresigniﬁcant differences ( P= 0.023) between the groups in themeasure of L* before exposure. After sun exposure no
signiﬁcant differences in L* are observed between the groups.TheL* measure taken before exposure demonstrated consis-tently higher median scores compared with L* taken after
signiﬁcant differences in L* are observed between the groups.TheL* measure taken before exposure demonstrated consis-tently higher median scores compared with L* taken afterexposure in all participant groups.The measure of b*, taken before sun exposure, did not showany differences across the groups. However the suntannedgroup had a signiﬁcant higher score (10.7) after sun exposurethan the other participant groups. The b* value after exposureshowed signiﬁcantly lower measures than before exposurewithin all participant groups.With regard to the a* parameter (see Table 4), no signiﬁcantdifferences were observed before or after exposure between orwithin the three groups.The changes in the colorimetric parameters, post and preexposure ( DL*,Da* and Db*) are signiﬁcant only for Db*across the groups ( P= 0.028).Table 2.

There were few variables correlated with ER. A moderateinverse correlation ( r=)0.426) exists between ER and Db*(signiﬁcance level P£0.001). L/C3afterandT/C3afterare both weaklynegatively correlated with ER ( r=)0.373 and r=)0.388,respectively, P£0.05), while b/C3before was the only variable toshow a positive small correlation ( r=0 . 3 6 9 ,P< 0.05) with ER.Skin temperatureResults on skin temperature are also reported in Table 4.Although all participant groups had the same median skintemperature before exposure, there were statistically lowertemperatures after sun exposure compared with before expo-sure in all participants, taking into account the uncertainty ofmeasure DT=± 1 /C176C.Free radicalsExamining the FR amounts taken before and after exposure(Table 5), there was no signiﬁcant difference across the sun-bather groups in either measures; however, in the non-sun-tanned group there was a signiﬁcantly larger number of FR after
sun exposure compared with before exposure ( P= 0.028).DISCUSSIONOur pilot study was stimulated by the possibility for the ﬁrsttime to collect data of personal UV exposure on the chest ofsunbathers in Italy in an environment of high solar UV levelssuch as on the beach.The results showed no signiﬁcant differences ( P= 0.722)across the groups in their ER median scores (0.20 forsuntanned individuals, 0.17 for non-suntanned individualsand 0.19 for photosensitive individuals) although a highvariability was observed due to the different postures (mini-mum is 0.09 for individuals mostly in motion and maximum of0.42 for those mainly lying). Thus, photodermatoses occur-rence cannot be attributed to the high values of ER. Themaximum ER values are higher than those reported by Gies inthe World Health Organization (WHO) report (45) where it ismentioned that UV exposure can vary from 5% to 15% oftotal ambient UV radiation and for outdoor workers expo-sures can reach 20–30%.

increase in the b* value on the exposed site conﬁrming theinverse relation between L* and b*.Further investigation is needed to explain why such b*increase was not observed in the other two sunbather groups.The similar behavior of the non-suntanned and the photosen-sitive individuals regarding the colorimetric parameters doesnot allow to characterize photodermatoses based on skin colorchanges.Regarding skin temperature measures, it was noticed thatsigniﬁcantly lower values were found after exposure, presum-ably attributed to extensive body sweating which in any caseobscures the much smaller endogenous temperature variations.It was found that the measure of the FRs in the plasma did notshow variations across the sunbather groups although in thenon-suntanned individuals there was a signiﬁcantly largernumber of FR after sun exposure compared with that beforeexposure ( P= 0.028).The application of the nonparametric Spearman Rank
correlation analysis suggests that photodermatoses are notsigniﬁcantly related to ER and to the changes in colorimetricparameters, in skin temperature and in FR amounts due to tooshort-term UV exposure. Nevertheless possible visible changescan be observed after a longer time interval after exposure. Acareful investigation of long-term endogenous effects will becarried out in further ﬁeld campaigns aiming at this speciﬁc issue.The general meaning of results collected in the present pilotstudy will become even more signiﬁcant on the background ofsimilar results derived from parallel campaigns (in due course)over different speciﬁc populations (skiers, outdoor workers,etc.) of the Mediterranean region.Acknowledgements— The authors are grateful to Dr. G.
