Carbohydrate-
restricted diets were reported to reduce visceral fat, owing to which they have attracted atten-tion and been widely implemented. If, as proposed, carbohydrate-restricted diets are effec-tive in delaying senescence, then Japanese diets have a hidden potential to evolve further. However, long-term carbohydrate restriction in mice was reported to have a negative effect on the cardiovascular system, with shortening of  lifespan due to activation of  mechanistic target of  rapamycin (mTOR). As a result, the safety of  long-term adherence to carbohydrate-restricted diets remains doubtful. Recently , we conducted a study using senescence-acceler -
ated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice to examine the effects of  a carbohydrate-restricted diet on aging and skin senescence, and to determine the effect of  long-term carbohydrate restric-tion on the aging process in mice. Here, we discuss the safety of  long-term carbohydrate restriction based on the findings obtained from animal studies.Key Words staple food, carbohydrate restriction, Japanese diet, SAMP8, senescenceHealth Benefit of  Japanese Diets and Staple FoodThe Japanese diet is considered to be one of  the fac-tors responsible for longevity in Japanese people and has been shown to contain various beneficial nutrients (1–5). We have conducted various studies to prove the health benefits of  the Japanese diet, beginning with an experiment on rats, which demonstrated that the con-temporary Japanese diet was highly beneficial for main-taining health compared with the contemporary Ameri-can diet (6).However, the Japanese diet has become more west-
However, the Japanese diet has become more west-ernized and has greatly changed over the past 50 y (7), and the incidence of  lifestyle-related diseases in Japan has concomitantly increased (8). To specifically deter -mine which of  the Japanese diet was most beneficial, we recreated Japanese diets from 1960, 1975, 1990, and 2005 under the guidance of  a head dietitian. The foods were freeze-dried and ground into a powder to prepare the experimental feed for mice. When these diets were administered to normal mice, the group following the 1975 Japanese diet showed the largest decrease in the visceral fat due to activation of  carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (9). When these diets were administered to senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) mice, the 1975 Japanese diet prolonged the lifespan and delayed the onset of  aging-related diseases (10, 11).Through these experiments, we were able to demon-
Through these experiments, we were able to demon-strate that the 1975 Japanese diet was highly beneficial for mouse health. Therefore, we next conducted a study to determine whether this diet exhibits beneficial effects in humans. The results demonstrated that following a diet with the characteristics of  the 1975 Japanese diet led to a decrease in the amount of  visceral fat in healthy subjects compared with the contemporary diet (12), thus, validating our hypothesis. This “1975 diet” has five main characteristics as mentioned below (12, 13):1. Variety: The 1975 diet used different types of  ingredients.2. Cooking methods: simmering (niru) played a large part in the 1975 diet.3. Ingredients: soy products, fish, shellfish, vegeta-bles, fruits, green tea, seaweed, and mushrooms were commonly used.4. Seasonings: Dashi stock and fermented seasoning (soy sauce, miso (fermented bean paste), vinegar, mirin (sweet rice wine), and sake (rice wine)) were commonly used.

(soy sauce, miso (fermented bean paste), vinegar, mirin (sweet rice wine), and sake (rice wine)) were commonly used.5. Format: the “rice-and-soup set” played a large part in the 1975 diet. This means that rice (the staple food) was the centerpiece of  the meal, accompanied by a soup and side dishes (okazu) of  small portions of  various ingredients.Carbohydrate-Restricted DietMeanwhile, another type of  diet was known to limit the quantity of  carbohydrates and replace it with pro-tein, without changing the overall portion size. Such low-carbohydrate, high-protein diets are known as carbohydrate-restricted diets that are in contrast to the typical Japanese carbohydrate-centric meals described above. Carbohydrate-restricted diets have been reported to reduce visceral fat, making them a widely popular choice (14). However, long-term carbohydrate restric-* To whom correspondence should be addressed.E-mail: tsudukit@tohoku.ac.jp
Okouchi  R et al.S68tion in mice was reported to negatively affect the cardio-vascular system, and shorten their lifespan by stimulat-ing mechanistic target of  rapamycin (mTOR) activation (15, 16). As a result, the safety of  long-term adherence to carbohydrate-restricted diet remains doubtful.Carbohydrate-Restricted Diet Promotes Skin AgingWe recently used SAMP8 mice to examine the effects of  a carbohydrate-restricted diet on the process of  aging
in mice, particularly skin senescence (17). All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Animal Experiment Guidelines of  Tohoku University , and the animal protocol was approved by the Animal Use Committee at Tohoku University (2017AgA-015) (Mizowaki et al., 2017; Iwagaki et al., 2018). SAMP8 mice were randomly divided into two groups of  20 mice, namely the CO group consisting of  mice fed the normal diet (AIN-93G), and the CHR group consisting of  mice fed the carbohydrate-restricted diet (low carbohydrate-high protein diet, in which milk casein, lard, and cho-lesterol replaced corn starch in the normal diet) (Table 1). At 49 wk of  age, the progression of  the appearance of  senescence was assessed. At 50 wk of  age, serum,
and skin samples were collected. The serum was used for measurement of  IL-6 and the skin was assessed by histological examination and measurement of  some senescence indicators. As a result, consumption of  the carbohydrate-restricted diet was found to reduce the survival rate and greatly accelerate aging of  the mice’s appearances (Fig. 1 and 2, Table 2). The aging-related visible changes in the skin, which are easy to observe externally , and skin senescence were closely related. Skin senescence is the manifestation of  intrinsic and extrinsic factors dependent on the age of  the individual (18, 19). The predominant extrinsic factor is the effect of  sunlight (ultraviolet rays), suggesting that the out-come in this study was mainly caused by an intrinsic factor, which manifested itself  by causing changes such as (1) decrease in the thickness of  the epidermis due to decrease in melanin cells and Langerhans cells (20, 21); (2) decreased quantity and cell density of  collagen in the
quantity and cell density of  collagen in the dermis, decreased proteoglycan content, reduced cutaneous sensation and production of  sebum, degen-eration of  sweat glands and blood vessels (22–27); and (3) decreased immunity in the organ (skin) as a whole, leading to delayed wound healing, and increased vul-nerability to inflammation. In our study , histological examination of  the skin revealed that the epidermis and dermis of  the mice fed with the carbohydrate-restricted diet had become significantly thin (Table 2), suggesting that carbohydrate-restricted diets accelerate skin senes-cence. We measured several indicators of  senescence, such as the mRNA levels of  p16 and p21, which are known to increase with aging (28), as well as levels of  Fig. 1.

The Effect of  Carbohydrate-Restricted Diets on the Skin Aging of  MiceS69thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), which have also been reported to increase with aging (29). These parameters exhibited high values under carbohy-drate restriction (Table 2), demonstrating that a carbo-hydrate-restricted diet promotes skin senescence.Autophagy , along with the ubiquitin–proteasome sys-
tem, is a major intracellular system for protein degra-dation. It is a large-scale degradation system that uses the enzyme lysosome to degrade cytoplasmic structural components. This degradation system is known to be involved in processes such as the degradation of  pro-teins that are damaged by stress (30–33). In addition to nutrient starvation, autophagy is induced by endo-plasmic reticulum stress, hypoxia, and oxidative stress caused by unfolded proteins and by bacterial and viral infections. Its mechanism is closely related to the intra-cellular signal transmission system. In recent years, analysis of  mice incapable of  autophagy has shown that autophagy contributes to the prevention of  various aging-related diseases, including neurodegenerative dis-eases and tumor formation, since decreased autophagic activity reduces inflammation and aging (34–36). In our study , measurement of  serum IL-6 level, an indica-tor of  autophagic activity and inflammation in the skin, suggested
activity and inflammation in the skin, suggested that the mice fed the carbohydrate-restricted diet demonstrated inhibited autophagy and aggravated inflammation (Table 2). Autophagy is regulated by mTOR (37, 38), and in a nutrient-rich environment, it is inactivated by mTOR-induced direct phosphorylation of  autophagy-related factors. Under nitrogen starva-tion, mTOR activity decreases, causing the molecules to dephosphorylate and activate downstream autophago-some formation. In our study , we observed strong mTOR activation in mice fed with the carbohydrate-restricted diet (Table 2). These findings demonstrate that long-term carbohydrate restriction promotes skin senescence in SAMP8 mice through mTOR activation.
When protein content in the body increases, as in a carbohydrate-restricted diet, it leads to high blood con-centrations of  valine, leucine, and isoleucine, which are branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) (39). BCAA acti-vates mTOR and its downstream pathway (40); conse-quently , the amount of  protein and carbohydrates in the diet greatly affects mTOR activation. mTOR activation, in turn, has been reported to shorten the lifespan of  the mice, while its inhibition has been reported to extend it (16, 41, 42). Under a 30–50% calorie restriction, the decreased intake of  protein and carbohydrates inhibits mTOR, delays senescence, and extends lifespan (43). Therefore, if  the mice were not fed ad libitum, as in this study , but rather given a carbohydrate-restricted diet on a restricted feeding plan, it is possible that senescence may not have been promoted.Carbohydrate-restricted diets completely contrast
the carbohydrate-centric meals typical of  the Japanese diet. If  carbohydrate-restricted diets are indeed effec-tive in delaying senescence, then Japanese foods can be improved further to include similar health benefits. However, carbohydrate restriction did not have any beneficial effects on longevity in our study . One of  the characteristics of  the Japanese diet that is effective in promoting longevity is that it uses a variety of  ingredi-ents without leaning heavily toward specific ingredients (12). However, in contrast to Japanese diets, the carbo-hydrate-restricted diets are extremely high in protein and fat, which leads to imbalanced nutrition. Previous studies have reported increased mTOR activation with increasing protein-to-carbohydrate ratios (16). Thus, carbohydrate restriction in a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet was found to be ineffective for longevity , as chronic mTOR activation promotes senescence.We previously tested using a high-fat diet that con-
We previously tested using a high-fat diet that con-tained a large amount of  lard in a similar manner to this study and showed that the high-fat diet promoted aging (17). In this study , the carbohydrate-restricted diet accelerated aging more than the previous high-fat diet results. Thus, it is possible that a large amount of  lard and carbohydrate restrictions acted synergistically to promote aging.Recently , a large-scale epidemiological study reported
that high carbohydrate intake leads to high mortality rates and increased risk of  cardiovascular diseases (44). However, the study did not observe a definite connec-tion between low intake of  carbohydrates (#50% calo-ries) and health, and rather than promoting intake of  low carbohydrate diet, concluded that moderate intake of  carbohydrates is optimal. There is no statistically sig-nificant difference in carbohydrate intake and mortal-ity rate in Asia, where the carbohydrate intake is high. The mortality rate is extremely low when carbohydrates are composed of  approximately 60% calories, forming a U-shaped curve. In Asia, negative effects were observed when carbohydrate intake was ,50% for .70% calo-Table 2.

Okouchi  R et al.S70ries. In our previous study , we observed that the lifes-pan of  mice was shorter when administered the 1960 Japanese diet, in which the carbohydrate content was 70% calories (11). Thus, we conclude that carbohydrate intake of  $70% calories is ineffective for longevity . In addition, while there is a large regional disparity in the effects of  carbohydrate intake, it is important to demon-strate the proportion of  calories that is safe for carbo-hydrate intake over a long-term period. We suggest that more research data should be accumulated, particu-larly on humans, in cases where carbohydrate intake is #50% calories.Disclosure of  State of  COINo conflicts of  interest to be declared.AcknowledgmentsThis research was supported by grants from the Proj-ect of  the NARO Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution (Advanced integration research for agriculture and interdisciplinary fields).REFERENCES
