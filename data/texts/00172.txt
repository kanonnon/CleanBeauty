UV induces oxidative stress and inﬂammation, which results inextracellular matrix degradation in the dermis and epidermal hyperplasia. Our previous studydemonstrated that ﬁsetin exerts photoprotective activity by inhibiting mitogen-activated proteinkinase/activator protein-1/matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activation. In this study, ﬁsetinwas applied topically to investigate its antiphotodamage effects in hairless mice. The erythemaindex (a* values) and transepidermal water loss were evaluated to assess skin damage, andimmunohistochemical staining was conducted to elucidate the photoprotective mechanism of ﬁsetin.The results revealed that the topical application of ﬁsetin reduced UVB-induced increase in the
a* value and wrinkle formation. In addition, ﬁsetin inhibited epidermal hyperplasia and increased thecollagen content in the dermis. Fisetin exerted photoprotective activity by inhibiting the expressionof MMP-1, MMP-2, and cyclooxygenase-2 and increasing the expression of nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor. Furthermore, ﬁsetin increased the expression of ﬁlaggrin to prevent UVB-inducedbarrier function disruption. Altogether, the present results provide evidence of the effects andmechanisms of ﬁsetin’s antiphotodamage and antiphotoinﬂammation activities.Keywords: ﬁsetin; photodamage; erythema; nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor; ﬁlaggrin1. IntroductionThe skin is an external organ that acts as a crucial barrier and defense system to prevent waterloss and damage due to sunlight exposure and environmental pollution. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiationinduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and inﬂammation in the dermis [ 1,2]. Long-term UV
exposure causes skin sagging or wrinkle formation because of the degradation of extracellular matrix(ECM) proteins, including elastin, collagen, and ﬁbronectin [ 3]. Collagen is the main structural proteinin the dermis and is synthesized in ﬁbroblasts. UV irradiation activates the signaling transductionpathway related to collagen degradation, causing the aforementioned fragmentation of collagen ﬁbersthat leads to skin sagging and wrinkle formation. Collagen synthesis is regulated by upstream factorssuch as the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), activator protein-1 (AP-1), andInt. J. Mol.

MMPs play vital roles in skin aging and photoaging processes.UV-induced MMP activation triggers ECM ubiquitination, which causes skin damage and wrinkleformation [4,5].UV irradiation may cause oxidative stress by ROS generation. ROS interact with cellularbiomolecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids and alters the redox status in skin cells [ 6].In addition, antioxidant-response element (ARE) is critical for the regulation of many genes that encodeantioxidant proteins, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) [ 7]. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor(Nrf2) binds to ARE to regulate the transcriptional activation of antioxidant genes. Nrf2/ARE/HO-1regulation neutralizes oxidative stress [ 7]. UV irradiation induces oxidative stress and inhibits theexpression and activity of Nrf2, thus causing skin damage.In addition to ECM damage, UV overexposure can result in the generation of proinﬂammatory
mediators, leading to skin inﬂammation. Interleukins (ILs) and nitric oxide (NO) play crucial roles inUV-induced skin inﬂammatory processes [ 8]. An increase in NO synthase (NOS) and cyclooxygenase(COX) causes skin erythema and inﬂammation. UVB irradiation induces skin erythema, whichis related to vascular dilation. UV exposure upregulates inducible NOS (iNOS) expression andsubsequently promotes NO generation, which stimulates peroxynitrite and ROS generation andupregulates COX-2 expression [ 9]. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF- κB) is a transcription factor thatmodulates proinﬂammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α) and ILs, resultingin hazardous effects [ 10,11]. UV exposure causes NF- κB translocation into the nucleus and triggers theinﬂammation and degradation of the ECM in the dermis [10,12].Fisetin is a ﬂavonoid that is abundant in fruits and vegetables [ 13]. It exhibits chemoprevention,
antioxidant, and anti-inﬂammatory activities [ 14–17]. A previous study reported that ﬁsetin increasesthe survival rate of retinal pigment epithelial cells through p53 acetylation and decreased SIRT1levels [ 15]. In addition, ﬁsetin inhibited TNF- α-induced inﬂammation and hydrogen peroxide-inducedoxidative damage in human keratinocytes [ 18]. It also inhibited the MAPK and NF- κB signalingcascade in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells to block their invasion ability. In addition, ﬁsetin inhibitedthe proliferation of melanoma cells [ 19,20], as well as ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3K) expression, protein kinase B (PKB; AKT) phosphorylation, and NF- κB activation inthe skin of SKH-1 mice [ 19]. Our previous study demonstrated that ﬁsetin alleviates UVB-inducedMAPK phosphorylation and elevated MMP expression and inﬂammation responses in human skinﬁbroblasts [ 21]. The present study further investigated the effects and mechanisms of ﬁsetin’s
antiphotodamage activity by modulating the Nrf-2 signaling pathway in hairless mice exposed to UVBirradiation. In addition, the expression of the collagen degradation protein and inﬂammatory-relatedprotein and skin barrier function were examined.2. Results2.1. Fisetin Protects Hairless Mice from UVB-Induced Skin DamageIn this study, female BALB/c hairless mice were exposed to UVB irradiation, and ﬁsetin wasapplied topically for 10 weeks. At the end of the experiment, no considerable differences were observedin the body weights of the mice in all ﬁve groups.Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is a marker for skin barrier function. TEWL increases when thestratum corneum is disrupted by physical factors or chemicals. The present results indicated that UVBexposure considerably enhances TEWL in mice. The topical application of ﬁsetin alleviated TEWLinduced by UVB exposure (Figure 1), indicating that ﬁsetin maintained skin barrier function duringUVB exposure.

To further understand the effects of fiseti n on UVB-induced skin aging, histological examinations were performed to determine the epidermal thickness and collagen content of the skin. The epidermal thickness was 38.61 ± 11.39 μm in the control group, which increased to 80.98 ± 8.34 μm in the UVB-irradiated group (Figures 4 an d 5). However, fisetin treatment (50 and 200 μM)
significantly reduced the epidermal thickness in duced by UVB-irradiated group. The epidermal thickness decreased by 62% in the UVB-irradiated 200 μM fisetin-treated group compared with the UVB-irradiated group.

Discussion UV irradiation enhances ROS formation to di sturb the balance between the synthesis and degradation of collagen. It also upregulates MMPs to promote ECM degradation and inhibits collagen production in the dermis, resulting in skin photoaging [1,22,23]. The topical application of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents may ameliorate UV-induced photodamage [23,24]. A previous study demonstrated that fisetin protects the skin from UVB-induced damage by inhibiting ROS generation and the MAPK/AP-1/MMP signaling pathway, decreasing collagen degradation in fibroblasts [21]. In the present study, the topical application of fisetin for 10 weeks reduced wrinkle
formation and collagen degradation in the mouse dorsal skin, thus protecting against photodamage. Studies have reported that fisetin exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, which may contribute to its antiphotodam age effects [14–17]. In addition, fisetin inhibited UVB-induced MMP overexpression to ameliorate collagen degradation in the dermis. UVB exposure may increase the expression levels  of proinflammatory factors, such as COX-2 and ILs [9,22]. IL-6 is associated with various cutaneous in ﬂammatory disorders, such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and photoaging [25]. The present results demonstrate that fisetin reduced UVB-induced IL-6 production. A previous study reported that fisetin inhibited COX-2 overexpression and inhibitor κB degradation, increased NF- κB levels in the cytoplasm, and reduced NF-κB translocation into the nucleus of fibroblast s. Furthermore, fisetin inhibited UV-induced
production of prostaglandin E2 and NO in human sk in fibroblasts [21]. In the present study, fisetin inhibited UVB-induced COX-2, iNOS, and NF- κB overexpression, protecting the dorsal skin of the hairless mice from photoi nflammation. Moreover, the upregulation of ILs and NF- κB may activate COX-2 expression in aged skin fibroblasts and kera tinocytes [26]. Our previous study revealed that fisetin treatment inhibits MAPK phos phorylation, which may inhibit NF- κB activation. NF- κB activates the expression of genes involved in in ﬂammatory and immunological responses [27]. In addition, the translocation of NF- κB into the nucleus induces the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, including iNOS, ILs, and COX-2, which were inhibited by fiseti n treatment. The present results are consistent with those of the previous study; therefore, fiseti n inhibited MMP, COX-2, and NF-κB expression in fibroblasts and the mouse skin. UV irradiation induces the translocation of
NF-κB into the nucleus and elevates MMP expression, leading to collagen degradation in human skin. Filaggrin is a structural protein in the stratum corneum that plays a vital role in the skin barrier
Filaggrin is a structural protein in the stratum corneum that plays a vital role in the skin barrier function [28]. Free filaggrin binds with kerati n intermediate filaments, which aggregate into macrofibrils to form a tightly packed struct ure expressed during terminal keratinocyte differentiation [29]. At the outer layers of the st ratum corneum, filaggrin is degraded into free amino acids, collectively referred to as natural moisturizing factors, which contribute to epidermal Figure 14.

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017 ,18, 2118 11 of 163. DiscussionUV irradiation enhances ROS formation to disturb the balance between the synthesis anddegradation of collagen. It also upregulates MMPs to promote ECM degradation and inhibits collagenproduction in the dermis, resulting in skin photoaging [ 1,22,23]. The topical application of antioxidantsand anti-inﬂammatory agents may ameliorate UV-induced photodamage [ 23,24]. A previous studydemonstrated that ﬁsetin protects the skin from UVB-induced damage by inhibiting ROS generationand the MAPK/AP-1/MMP signaling pathway, decreasing collagen degradation in ﬁbroblasts [ 21].In the present study, the topical application of ﬁsetin for 10 weeks reduced wrinkle formation andcollagen degradation in the mouse dorsal skin, thus protecting against photodamage. Studies havereported that ﬁsetin exhibits antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory activities, which may contribute to its
antiphotodamage effects [ 14–17]. In addition, ﬁsetin inhibited UVB-induced MMP overexpression toameliorate collagen degradation in the dermis.UVB exposure may increase the expression levels of proinﬂammatory factors, such as COX-2 andILs [ 9,22]. IL-6 is associated with various cutaneous inﬂammatory disorders, such as atopic dermatitis,psoriasis, and photoaging [ 25]. The present results demonstrate that ﬁsetin reduced UVB-inducedIL-6 production. A previous study reported that ﬁsetin inhibited COX-2 overexpression and inhibitorκB degradation, increased NF- κB levels in the cytoplasm, and reduced NF- κB translocation intothe nucleus of ﬁbroblasts. Furthermore, ﬁsetin inhibited UV-induced production of prostaglandinE2 and NO in human skin ﬁbroblasts [ 21]. In the present study, ﬁsetin inhibited UVB-inducedCOX-2, iNOS, and NF- κB overexpression, protecting the dorsal skin of the hairless mice from
photoinﬂammation. Moreover, the upregulation of ILs and NF- κB may activate COX-2 expressionin aged skin ﬁbroblasts and keratinocytes [ 26]. Our previous study revealed that ﬁsetin treatmentinhibits MAPK phosphorylation, which may inhibit NF- κB activation. NF- κB activates the expressionof genes involved in inﬂammatory and immunological responses [ 27]. In addition, the translocation ofNF-κB into the nucleus induces the transcription of proinﬂammatory cytokines, including iNOS, ILs,and COX-2, which were inhibited by ﬁsetin treatment. The present results are consistent with those ofthe previous study; therefore, ﬁsetin inhibited MMP , COX-2, and NF- κB expression in ﬁbroblasts andthe mouse skin. UV irradiation induces the translocation of NF- κB into the nucleus and elevates MMPexpression, leading to collagen degradation in human skin.Filaggrin is a structural protein in the stratum corneum that plays a vital role in the skin
barrier function [ 28]. Free ﬁlaggrin binds with keratin intermediate ﬁlaments, which aggregateinto macroﬁbrils to form a tightly packed structure expressed during terminal keratinocytedifferentiation [29]. At the outer layers of the stratum corneum, ﬁlaggrin is degraded into free aminoacids, collectively referred to as natural moisturizing factors, which contribute to epidermal hydrationand barrier function [ 30]. Filaggrin deﬁciency results in the disruption of skin barrier function, andchronic UV exposure downregulates ﬁlaggrin [31].Aquaporins (AQPs) are integral epidermal cell membrane proteins that facilitate water ﬂow inand out of the cell. They are involved in various cellular functions, such as cell proliferation andmigration. AQP3 expression is involved in skin diseases, including wound healing, atopic dermatitis,and psoriasis, the pathogenesis of which is attributed to AQP3’s water or glycerol transport function in
epidermal keratinocytes [ 32]. In addition, chronic UV exposure damages skin integrity and increaseswater loss through the skin, causing dryness. The results of this study suggested that topical application
water loss through the skin, causing dryness. The results of this study suggested that topical applicationof vehicle (PEG400) for 10 weeks may decrease the expression of MMP-1, -2, and IL-6, while increasingthe expression of ﬁlaggrin and aquaporin. Polyols act as a humectant to increase the hydration of theskin and improve the barrier function; therefore, they are used as fundamental skin care [ 33,34]. It wasreported that local application of glycerol and xylitol increased skin hydration and protein expressionof ﬁlaggrin [ 35]. In addition, the results indicated that effects of ﬁsetin on skin protection were superiorto that of PEG. Our results indicate that the topical application of ﬁsetin reduces TEWL and increasesthe ﬁlaggrin content in the stratum corneum. In addition, ﬁsetin enhances aquaporin content in the
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017 ,18, 2118 12 of 16skin. Altogether, ﬁsetin ameliorates UVB-induced skin damage by inhibiting aquaporin and ﬁlaggrindamage, thus reducing water loss and preventing skin drying.4. Materials and Methods4.1. MaterialsFisetin, DL-dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, and Triton X-100 were purchased fromSigma-Aldrich Chemical Corporation (St. Louis, MO, USA). MMP-1, MMP-2, COX-2, and Nrf2antibodies were purchased from Genetex (Beverly, MA, USA). All reagents and chemicals used for theexperiments were analysis grade.4.2. Experimental AnimalsAll experimental protocols were approved by the institutional animal use and care committeeof China Medical University (Protocol No.: 104-240-B, 19/2/2015). Five-week-old femaleBALB/cAnN.Cg-Foxn1nu/CrlNarl hairless mice were obtained from the National Laboratory AnimalCenter (Taipei, Taiwan). The mice were maintained under controlled conditions: temperature,
22◦C±2◦C; relative humidity, 50 ±10%; light–dark cycle: 12 h.4.3. UVB Irradiation and Fisetin TreatmentAfter the 1-week acclimatization, the mice were divided into ﬁve groups: control, UVB-irradiated,vehicle (polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400)-treated and UVB-irradiated, UVB-irradiated and 25 µMﬁsetin-treated, and UVB-irradiated and 100 µM ﬁsetin-treated. Each group had ﬁve mice. A UV light(a broadband with a peak emission at 302 nm, CL-1000 M, UVP , USA) was used. The mice wereexposed to a gradually increased dose of UVB irradiation three times a week: ﬁrst week, 36 mJ/cm2;second–fourth weeks, 54 mJ/cm2; ﬁfth–seventh weeks, 72 mJ/cm2; and 8th–10th weeks, 108 mJ/cm2,as described previously [ 36,37]. The vehicle-treated UVB-irradiated mice were topically administered50µL of PEG daily, and the ﬁsetin-treated mice were topically administered 50 µL of 25 or 100 µMﬁsetin prepared in PEG 400 daily. Fisetin was applied on the skin after UVB irradiation. The control
mice did not receive any treatment. All treatments were administered to the dorsal skin.4.4. Measurement of Wrinkle Formation on the Dorsal SkinThe wrinkle formation on the dorsal skin of mice was observed macroscopically. The degree ofwrinkle formation was evaluated from the photograph of each mouse according to the grading scaledescribed previously, while the name of the group was unrevealed to the researcher [36].4.5. Measurement of Skin Erythema and TEWLTo evaluate the effects of ﬁsetin on UVB-induced erythema, erythema was tested every 2 weeksby using a spectrocolorimeter (SCM-104/108, Ruyico Technology Corporation, Taipei, Taiwan), asdescribed previously [ 37,38]. The erythema was showed as a* value, which represents the coloropponents green–red and is present as green at negative a* values and red at positive a* values.In addition, TEWL from the dorsal skin was measured at the 10th week with a Tewameter TM 300(Courage + Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Cologne, Germany).
4.6. Preparation of Skin Specimens and Hematoxylin and Eosin StainingThe mice were sacriﬁced, and the dorsal skin samples were excised and ﬁxed in 10% formaldehydeand embedded in parafﬁn as described previously [ 37,38]. The skin slides were stained in hematoxylinand eosin, and the skin thickness of each section was determined using Image J software, as describedpreviously (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Collagen in the skin sections wasstained using Masson trichrome and examined under a microscope [38].
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017 ,18, 2118 13 of 164.7. Immunohistochemical StainingThe skin sections were stained with the following monoclonal antimouse antibodies: MMP-1,MMP-2, IL-6, COX-2, NF- κB, Nrf-2, aquaporin, and ﬁlaggrin (Genetex, Beverly, MA, USA). The skinsections were examined under a microscope, and the protein expression was determined using Image Jsoftware, as described previously (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) [38].4.8. Statistical AnalysisThe results were expressed as means ±standard deviations. In the quantitation ofimmunohistochemical staining, two stained slides for each animal were measured. Signiﬁcantdifferences between groups in the experiments were analyzed using analysis of variance with leastsigniﬁcant difference post hoc tests. A pvalue of <0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.5. ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that ﬁsetin attenuates UVB-induced damage, oxidative stress,
inﬂammation, and skin barrier function disruption. Fisetin inhibits the UVB-induced expressionof MMPs, COX-2, IL-6, and NF- κB, thus protecting the skin from wrinkles and erythema. Fisetin alsoincreases the expression of Nrf2 in the mice skin. In addition, ﬁsetin effectively inhibits UV-inducedaquaporin and ﬁlaggrin damage. The present study demonstrates the protective effects of ﬁsetinagainst UV-induced skin damage.Acknowledgments: This study was funded by China Medical University (CMU102-ASIA-18, CMU103-ASIA-11),Taichung, and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST 104-2320-B-039-006), Taipei, Taiwan.Author Contributions: Po-Yuan Wu, Kuo-Ching Wen, and Hsiu-Mei Chiang conceived the study and participatedin study design and coordination; Jia-Ling Lyu, Yi-Jung Liu, Ting-Yi Chien, Hao-Cheng Hsu, and Hsiu-Mei Chiangperformed the animal experiments and collected the data; and Po-Yuan Wu, Jia-Ling Lyu, Kuo-Ching Wen, andHsiu-Mei Chiang wrote and revised the manuscript.
