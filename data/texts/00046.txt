Schoonmaker1, Kay Brinkmann2, Ulrike Dirmeier2, Reiner Laus1, and Alain Delcayre1AbstractMVA-BN-PRO (BN ImmunoTherapeutics) is a candidate immunotherapy product for the treatment ofprostate cancer. It encodes 2 tumor-associated antigens, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and prostatic acidphosphatase (PAP), and is derived from the highly attenuated modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus stockknown as MVA-BN. Past work has shown that the immunogenicity of antigens can be improved by targetingtheir localization to exosomes, which are small, 50- to 100 –nm diameter vesicles secreted by most cell types.Exosome targeting is achieved by fusing the antigen to the C1C2 domain of the lactadherin protein. To test
whether exosome targeting would improve the immunogenicity of PSA and PAP, 2 additional versions of MVA-BN-PRO were produced, targeting either PSA (MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2) or PAP (MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2) to exosomes,while leaving the second transgene untargeted. Treatment of mice with MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 led to a strikingincrease in the immune response against PAP. Anti-PAP antibody titers developed more rapidly and reachedlevels that were 10- to 100-fold higher than those for mice treated with MVA-BN-PRO. Furthermore, treatmentwith MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 increased the frequency of PAP-specific T cells 5-fold compared with mice treated withMVA-BN-PRO. These improvements translated into a greater frequency of tumor rejection in a PAP-expressingsolid tumor model. Likewise, treatment with MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 increased the antigenicity of PSA comparedwith treatment with MVA-BN-PRO and resulted in a trend of improved antitumor efficacy in a PSA-expressing
tumor model. These experiments confirm that targeting antigen localization to exosomes is a viable approachfor improving the therapeutic potential of MVA-BN-PRO in humans.

This recombinantvector is derived from a clonal isolate of the highly attenuatedmodified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus stock known as MVA-BNand encodes 2 validated tumor-associated antigens (TAA),prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostatic acid phosphatase(PAP). PSA is a secreted protein found at elevated levels in theserum of men with prostate cancer (2). Recently, PSA has shownpromise as an immunotherapy tumor antigen for prostatecancer patients. In a phase II trial of PROSTVAC (BN Immuno-Therapeutics), a poxviral-based immunotherapy that targets
PSA, treated patients showed an average increase in mediansurvival of 8.5 months compared with those treated with controlvectors (3). PAP is a glycosylated phosphatase found in prostateepithelium which occurs either as an intracellular or secretedprotein (4). PAP has recently been validated as an antigen forprostate cancer immunotherapy through the approval of thedendritic cell –based therapy sipuleucel-T (5, 6). Therefore, theinclusion of both PSA and PAP as transgenes in MVA-BN-PRO ishoped to provide improved efficacy in prostate cancer patientscompared with therapies targeting only a single antigen.A technology platform called exosome display has recentlybeen described that exploits the exosome pathway for a broadrange of applications including vaccine (7, 8) and therapeuticantibody development (9). Exosomes are 50- to 100 –nmdiameter membrane vesicles secreted into the extracellularspace. They bind or fuse with neighboring cells in a process
thought to allow cell-to-cell communication at a distance. Theeffects of exosomes on the immune system have become the
space. They bind or fuse with neighboring cells in a processthought to allow cell-to-cell communication at a distance. Theeffects of exosomes on the immune system have become thesubject of increasing interest due to studies showing that theycan provide activating signals through several differentmechanisms. For example, exosomes produced by antigen-presenting cells (APC) contain MHC class I and class IIcomplexes along with costimulatory proteins, and purifiedexosomes can activate CD4 or CD8 T cells.

exosomes purified from other cell types can spread antigens orpeptide-loaded MHC complexes to APCs for more efficientpresentation (see ref. 10 for a review on the effects of exosomeson immune cells). One modality used for exosome display ofantigens is the generation of chimeric expression constructsencoding a protein of interest fused to the C1C2 domain oflactadherin (7). Lactadherin is released via the exosomesecretory pathway by binding to the vesicle surface, andchimeric proteins containing the C1C2 domain of lactadherinhave been shown to be released into the extracellular milieubound to exosomes. The potential of this technology forvaccine application was recently illustrated in studies wherevaccination of mice with a DNA vector encoding chickenovalbumin (OVA) fused to the C1C2 domain slowed thegrowth of OVA-expressing tumors more than vaccinationwith vectors encoding membrane-bound or secreted OVA(11). Although OVA is a commonly used model antigen in
proof-of-principle studies, this technology has not been vali-dated for therapeutically relevant tumor antigens.Here, we describe studies to test whether the immunogeni-city or therapeutic efficacy of MVA-BN-PRO can be improvedby targeting PSA or PAP to exosomes. Two additional MVA-BN-PRO vectors were made, one modified to express PSA-C1C2 and wild-type PAP, and the other modified to expressPAP-C1C2 and wild-type PSA. Treatment of mice with theMVA-BN-PRO vector encoding exosome-targeted PAP led to astriking increase in the immune response against PAP. Moreimportantly, it resulted in enhanced antitumor activity againsta syngeneic tumor expressing PAP when compared withvectors encoding the wild-type transgene. Likewise, treatmentwith the viral vector encoding exosome-targeted PSAincreased the antigenicity of PSA and showed a trend ofimproved antitumor activity in a PSA-expressing solid tumormodel. These experiments show that targeting tumor-asso-
ciated antigens to exosomes is a viable approach for improv-ing the therapeutic potential of MVA-BN-PRO for thetreatment of prostate cancer in humans.Materials and MethodsDNA expression plasmids and cell linesFour DNA expression vectors were constructed usingpcDNA3.1/Zeo or pcDNA3.1/Hygro (Invitrogen) to expresseither wild-type or C1C2-fused versions of PSA or PAP:pPSA/Zeo, pPSA-C1C2/Zeo, pPAP/Hygro, and pPAP-C1C2/Hygro under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter.The open reading frame (ORF) of human PSA or human PAPwas amplified by PCR from the pCR2.1 PSA or the pCR2.1 PAPvectors (Bavarian Nordic) using primers that added a 50Kozaktranslation initiation sequence and unique restriction sitesflanking the ORFs to aid in cloning. To generate constructsencoding C-terminal fusions to the C1C2 domain of lactad-herin, this domain was amplified from vector p6mLC1C2 (7)using the forward primer 50-accgaatacatctgccagtgcc-30and the
reverse primer 50-cactgtaagcttaacagcccagcagctccagg-30. Thisproduct was then blunt-end ligated to the PCR-amplified ORFofPSA orPAP and then cloned into the multiple cloning siteof pcDNA3.1/Zeo or pcDNA3.1/Hygro, respectively.HEK293-F cells (Invitrogen) were grown as adherent cul-tures in Dulbecco's modi ﬁed Eagle's medium (DMEM) mediawith 4.5 g/L glucose, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and 10%FBS (Mediatech, Inc.) and transfected with plasmid DNAfrom one of the 4 DNA expression plasmids described aboveusing the Lipofectamine LTX reagent and PLUS Reagent(Invitrogen). Cells were selected on media supplemented with250mg/mL of Zeocin or Hygromycin B (Invitrogen) as appro-priate for the plasmid. Drug-resistant cells were single-cellcloned to generate cell lines.E6 cells (12) express human PSA and were grown in DMEMmedia with 10% FBS (Mediatech).

To generate CT26-PAP cell lines, CT26cells were transfected with the pPAP/Hygro plasmid andselected for drug-resistant clones as described for HEK293-Fcells. PAP expression was verified in conditioned media withthe UBI Magiwel PAP Quantitative Test ELISA (United Bio-tech). Cell lines have not been independently authenticated.VirusesMVA-BN-PRO was modified using vectors derived from theabove DNA expression plasmids to create MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2and MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2. All viral vectors were produced andassayed for 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50)b yBavarian Nordic according to established methods (14). Inaddition to the TCID 50assay, the infectious unit (IU) titers ofthe viral stocks were determined at BN ImmunoTherapeuticsusing flow cytometry (15).Western blotting

Soluble protein was appliedto SDS-PAGE gels, electrophoresed under reducing condi-tions, and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride mem-branes using the iBlot system (Invitrogen). Proteins weredetected using the WesternBreeze Chromogenic Immunode-tection Kit (Invitrogen) with a mouse anti-human PAP mono-clonal antibody (clone 4LJ; Santa Cruz Biotech) or a rabbitanti-human PSA polyclonal antibody (DAKO). Purified PSA orPAP was used as reference protein (Meridian Life ScienceInc.).Anti-CD81 cross-capture ELISATo prepare media enriched with exosomes for analysis bythe anti-CD81 cross-capture ELISA, HEK293-F cell lines were

The anti-CD81 cross-capture ELISA was done as described(9, 16) with modifications. The 96-well plates were coated withan anti-CD81 antibody (clone JS-81, BD Biosciences) at aconcentration of 4 mg/mL in PBS, washed with 0.05%Tween-20 in PBS, blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 hour,and washed again. Two-fold dilutions of exosome-enrichedmedia were added to each well and incubated at roomtemperature for 12 hours to allow binding of exosomes tothe plate via the anti-CD81 antibody. Wells were washed, andPSA was detected with the anti-PSA horseradish peroxidase(HRP)-conjugated antibody and detection protocol from theHuman PSA ELISA Kit (Anogen). For the detection of PAP,wells were washed and incubated in 90 mmol/L citrate bufferpH 4.8 with 4 mg/mL p-nitrophenyl-phosphate at 37/C14Cf o r3 0minutes. The reaction was stopped with 0.5 mol/L sodiumhydroxide, and the absorbance at 405 nm was read using aMultiskan plate reader (Thermo Electronics). For the detection
of other proteins, wells were incubated with biotinylatedantibodies in PBS with 3% BSA, washed, incubated withstreptavidin HRP (BD Biosciences) in PBS with 3% BSA,washed, and then developed with the TMB substrate solution(EMD Chemicals). Development was stopped with 0.5 mol/Lsulfuric acid and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured. Thefollowing biotinylated detection antibodies were used: anti-CD81 (clone JS-81 biotinylated with the EZ-Link NHS-PEOSolid Phase Biotinylation Kit, Pierce/Thermo Scientific), anti-MHC class I (clone W6/32; Abnova), and an IgG1 isotypecontrol (BD Biosciences).Animal studiesMale BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice aged 6 to 8 weeks old wereobtained from Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc.

Fortumor studies, 5 /C2105CT26-PAP or 1 /C2105E6-PSA cellswere implanted intradermally (i.d.), and tumor size wasmeasured twice weekly with calipers. Tumor volume was
calculated as (length /C2width2)/2. Statistical significanceover the course of the measurements was determined byrepeated measure ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) with Bonferroni'smultiple comparison test. D ifferences in tumor size at aparticular time point were compared by 1-way ANOVA withBonferroni's multiple comparison test. All protocols wereapproved by the BN ImmunoTherapeutics Institutional Ani-mal Care and Use Committee.Determination of serum antibody titers by ELISAThe 96-well plates were coated with PSA or PAP protein(Meridian Life Science Inc.) diluted in carbonate buffer orMVA-BN diluted in PBS, then washed and blocked for 1 hourwith PBS þ0.05% Tween20.

Subsequently, plates werewashed with PBS, blocked with RPMI-10 media (RPMI þ10% BCS þ5/C210/C05mol/L b-Mercaptoethanol; Mediatech),washed again, and then splenocytes of treated mice wereplated at 5E5 cells per well in RPMI-10. Cells were stimulatedwith the indicated reagents for 40 hours at 37/C14C, washed,incubated with a biotin-conjugated anti-IFN- gantibody (AbDSerotec), washed again, and then incubated with Streptavidin-Alkaline Phosphatase (BD Biosciences).

Spots werecounted using an ImmunoSpot plate scanner (Cellular Tech-nology Ltd.).ResultsConstruction and characterization MVA-BN-PROviruses with exosome-targeted transgenesTo target the localization of PSA and PAP to exosomes, 2new viral vectors were developed that encode fusion proteinslinking the C1C2 domain of mouse lactadherin to the C-terminus of PSA or PAP (Fig. 1A). The expression of thetransgenes encoded by these vectors was characterized usingthe mouse colon carcinoma cell line CT26. CT26 cells wereincubated with MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 or MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 ata multiplicity of infection (MOI) ranging from 1 to 100. Wholecell lysates were prepared 24 hours later for analysis byWestern blotting. On blots probed with an anti-PSA antibody,a 64-kDa band was detected in MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 infected
cells consistent with the predicted 66-kDa size of the PSA-C1C2protein (Fig. 1B). The wild-type PSA protein encoded by MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 was detected at the expected size of 30 kDa,which was similar to the dominant band present in the laneloaded with purified PSA protein. On blots of the same lysatesprobed with an anti-PAP antibody, a 50-kDa band was revealedin cells infected with MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2, which matched thesize of purified wild-type PAP protein (Fig. 1C). Likewise, an 80-kDa band was detected in lysates from cells infected with MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2, which corresponds to the predicted 79-kDa sizeof PAP-C1C2. A faint 50-kDa band was also detected in theselysates, which may be a cleavage product of the larger PAP-C1C2 protein. When cells were infected with either virus at thehighest MOI, a doublet of bands appeared, which may be aresult of cytopathic effects due to the virus being present at avery high MOI.Conditioned media from similarly infected cultures was
analyzed for the presence of secreted transgenic proteins(Supplementary Fig. S1). Low or undetectable amounts ofPSA-C1C2 or PAP-C1C2 were measured, compared with highamounts of unmodified PSA or PAP. This is consistent withthe expression characteristics of other secreted proteins fol-lowing linkage to a C1C2 domain (7). Together with theWestern blots, these data indicate that infection of cells byMVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 or MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 results in theExosome Targeting of Tumor Antigens Improves Efficacywww.aacrjournals.org Cancer Res; 71(15) August 1, 2011 5237Downloaded from http://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/71/15/5235/2655372/5235.pdf?casa_token=mZD-Zur0PW4AAAAA:iEHov3UIVbOn2OaENWWcxhLi8Wh-IOCFGVKuRBcNaOa0gJEoyPRru9Zam3oVjqwUDWwTgeRYuQ by Keio University user on 26 September 2024
synthesis of protein products of the expected size and expres-sion level for wild-type and exosome-targeted versions of PSAand PAP.Localization of PSA-C1C2 and PAP-C1C2 proteinsTo generate large cultures of cells suitable for characteriz-ing protein expression on exosomes, stably transfectedHEK293-F cell lines were generated that expressed proteinfrom 1 of 4 DNA expression constructs, encoding either wild-type or exosome-targeted PSA or PAP. Expression of thetransgenic proteins in the cell lines was found to be relativelysimilar to what was observed with the virally infected CT26cells (data not shown).Exosome targeting of PSA-C1C2 and PAP-C1C2 was verifiedas previously described (9, 16) using an anti-CD81 –basedcross-capture ELISA. In this assay, an antibody against thetetraspan protein CD81 was used to capture exosomes fromconcentrated conditioned media from each of the HEK celllines. Subsequently, the presence of PSA or PAP on exosomes
was determined using an anti-PSA antibody or an enzymaticassay for PAP in the detection steps. A positive PSA-specificsignal was detected in media conditioned by the HEK-PSA-C1C2 cell line but not in the media from the HEK-PSA cell line(Fig. 2A). Likewise, a PAP-specific signal was only detected inmedia from the HEK-PAP-C1C2 cell line (Fig. 2B). Aliquots ofthese samples were further tested with anti-CD81 (Fig. 2C) andanti-MHC class I (Fig. 2D) detection antibodies as controls toverify the amount of exosomes captured in the assay. Asshown in Fig. 2E, lower signals were obtained from theHEK-PSA-C1C2 sample, which suggests a lower concentrationof exosomes in this preparation. Overall, these experimentsprovide evidence that the C1C2-fusion proteins are localizedto exosomes.Humoral responses in mice treated with MVA-BN-PROvectors encoding wild-type or exosome-targeted PSAand PAPTo assess whether exosome targeting improved the
To assess whether exosome targeting improved thehumoral response against PSA or PAP, male BALB/c orC57BL/6 mice were treated with 5E7 TCID 50of the MVA-BN-PRO viral vectors once every 2 weeks for a total of 3treatments. Serum was collected 2 weeks after each treatment,and the titer of anti-PSA IgG, anti-PAP IgG, or anti-MVA IgGwas evaluated in pooled sera from each group by ELISA. Asshown in Fig. 3A, BALB/c mice treated with any of the 3viruses developed anti-PSA IgG titers with similar kinetics thatreached a titer of 64,000 by day 42. Notably, anti-PSA IgG titerswere undetectable in C57BL/6 mice treated with the virusesencoding wild-type PSA, whereas low titers did develop inmice treated with MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 (Fig. 3B).The anti-PAP IgG titers induced by treatment with theviruses encoding wild-type PAP tended to be low in BALB/cand C57BL/6 mice and required 2 or 3 treatments for detec-tion (Fig. 3C and D). In contrast, anti-PAP IgG titers were 16- to
128-fold higher in BALB/c mice treated with MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2. Furthermore, anti-PAP IgG titers were detectable afteronly a single dose (day 14). Similar titers were reached evenwhen mice were treated with 10-fold lower amounts of thisvirus (data not shown). An analysis of titers from individualmice revealed that all BALB/c mice treated with MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 developed anti-PAP IgG titers detectable at thelowest dilution tested (1:125), compared with only 7 or 10 micetreated with MVA-BN-PRO or MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 (Supple-mentary Fig. S2). In C57BL/6 mice, MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 treat-ment also led to higher anti-PAP IgG titers than the otherviruses (Fig. 3D). The anti-MVA IgG titers raised by the 3 viralvectors were similar between all 3 viruses (Fig. 3E and F),MVA-BN-PRO-AMVA-BN-PSA-C1C2MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2PSA PAPPs PsPAP C1C2 PSAPs PsC1C2 PSA PAPPs PsAC B97 kDa64 kDa51 kDa39 kDa28 kDa19 kDa97 kDa64 kDa51 kDa39 kDa28 kDa19 kDaPSA100 ngMVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2

supporting that the differences detected between groups werenot due to variable virus dosing.The relative ratio of antibody isotypes produced against anantigen (IgG2a/IgG1 for BALB/c or IgG2c/IgG1 for C57BL/6mice) can be used to indicate whether the response is morebiased toward a Th1 response (higher ratio) or a Th2 response(lower ratio; refs. 17, 18). In BALB/c mice, the ratios for anti-PSA and anti-PAP antibody titers were similar among allgroups and were consistent with a Th1 response (data notshown). In C57BL/6 mice, the antibody titers were also con-sistent with a Th1 response, but responses generated againstthe nonexosome-targeted antigens were so low that ratioscould not be determined (data not shown).T-cell responses in mice treated with MVA-BN-PROvectors encoding wild-type or exosome-targeted PSAand PAPTo investigate the effects of immunization with exosome-targeted antigens on cellular immunity, BALB/c mice were
immunized every 2 weeks for a total of 4 treatments withMVA-BN-PRO, MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2, or MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2.Five days after the last immunization, the frequency ofPSA, PAP, or MVA-specific T-cell responses in restimulatedsplenocytes was enumerated by ELISPOT. As shown in Fig. 4A,treatment with MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 induced a 2 to 4-foldhigher frequency of PSA-specific T cells than the other groups.Furthermore, the frequency of PAP-specific T cells was 4- to 6-fold higher in mice treated with MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 than theother groups (Fig. 4B). The frequencies of anti-MVA T cellsbetween each group were at most 40% different from eachother (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the differences seen for PSAand PAP were specific to exosome targeting of these antigens.Depletion of CD4 or CD8 T cells prior to restimulation withPSA or PAP overlapping peptide library (OPL) showed that theratio of CD4:CD8 T cells responding to the stimuli was similar
in mice treated with the viruses encoding either exosome-targeted or wild-type antigens (data not shown).Therapeutic activity of MVA-BN-PRO viruses in mousemodels of prostate cancerThe therapeutic efficacy of MVA-BN-PRO viruses encodingexosome-targeted or wild-type transgenes was compared inFigure 2.

tumor models of prostate cancer. To evaluate the antitumoractivity of these viruses against PAP-expressing tumors, newCT26-PAP cell lines were established and used in preventiontherapy experiments. Whereas treatment with all 3 MVA-BN-PRO viruses showed significant protection as compared withTBS or MVA-BN-treated groups ( P<0.001; RM-ANOVA), thegreatest suppression of tumor growth occurred in mice trea-ted with MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 (Fig. 5A –C). This difference wasnot only statistically significant against the TBS- or MVA-BN –treated groups ( P<0.001), but also against the other PRO virustreatment groups ( P<0.01).

treatment group had significantly smaller tumors comparedwith both TBS and MVA-BN (Fig. 5B; P<0.001; ANOVA).Similar results were obtained in tumor efficacy experimentsusing an independently isolated CT26-PAP clone (data notshown). Treatment with MVA-BN-PRO or MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2did not reduce tumor growth in CT26-PAP tumor modelswhen used in a therapeutic setting (data not shown).In an effort to correlate antitumor efficacy with immuneresponses against PAP, the anti-PAP IgG titers and IgG2a/IgG1isotype ratios were determined from individual mice at theend of the study (Fig. 5D –G). Mice treated with TBS hadtumor-induced anti-PAP IgG antibody titers with a medianvalue of 5,000 (Fig. 5D), and a low IgG2a/IgG1 ratio (Fig. 5G,median ¼0.05). Treatment with MVA-BN-PRO or MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 led to a similar anti-PAP IgG antibody titer and aslightly higher IgG2a/IgG1 ratio (Fig. 5G, median ¼0.19 and0.13, respectively). In contrast, mice treated with MVA-BN-
PAP-C1C2 had overall higher anti-PAP IgG antibody titersthan those induced by the growing tumor (Fig. 5D, median ¼64,000). This was mainly due to a considerable increase in anti-PAP–specific antibodies of the IgG2a isotype (Fig. 5E,median ¼64,000; P<0.01) resulting in a much higherIgG2a/IgG1 ratio as compared with the other groups(Fig. 5G, median ¼2.00; P<0.01). These results indicate thatgrowth of the CT26-PAP tumors promoted a Th2-biasedhumoral response against PAP as indicated by the relativelylow IgG2a/IgG1 ratio in the mice treated with TBS. However,previous treatment with MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 but not MVA-BN-PRO or MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2, significantly increased theanti-PAP IgG2a/IgG1 ratio, suggesting that this therapyinduced a stronger and more Th1-biased immune responseagainst the tumor antigen.Therapeutic efficacy was also tested in an immunotherapysetting using the PSA-expressing E6 cell line, and the datafrom 2 replicate studies are shown combined in Fig. 6. The
tumors in mice treated with any of the 3 MVA-BN-PRO virusesgrew significantly slower than in mice treated with TBS orMVA-BN ( P<0.01 or 0.001). Furthermore, a trend of improvedefficacy was seen in the mice treated with MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2.These mice had the smallest tumor volume at multiple timepoints (Fig. 6A and C) and no tumors larger than 350 mm3ondays 17 or 18 (Fig. 6B). As described before in the PAP tumormodel, anti-PSA IgG titers and IgG2a/IgG1 isotype ratios weredetermined in individual mice from each group at the end ofthe study (Fig. 6D –G). The growing tumor by itself induced aTh2-biased anti-PSA immune response with a low IgG2a/IgG1ratio (Fig. 6G TBS group, median ratio ¼0.125). Notably,treatment with MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2 significantly increasedthe anti-PSA IgG2a/IgG1 ratio above that of all other groups(Fig. 6G, median ¼0.5;P<0.01). Therefore, in the immunother-apeutic setting only treatment with the vector encoding exo-
some-targeted PSA was capable of shifting the tumor-inducedPSA response toward a Th1 bias. In prevention experiments,treatment with any of the 3 MVA-BN-PRO viruses providedsimilar, strong protection (data not shown).Overall, these experiments showed that treatment withMVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 led to the strongest antitumor activityin a PAP-expressing tumor model. This enhancement corre-lated with an increased anti-PAP humoral response character-ized by a high IgG2a/IgG1 ratio. Moreover, MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2treatment resulted in a trend of improved antitumor activityagainst a PSA-expressing tumor model and also promoted ananti-PSA humoral response with a high IgG2a/IgG1 ratio.DiscussionRecently, prostate cancer immunotherapy has made greatprogress in the clinic and shows that the immune system canbe utilized to extend patient survival (3, 5, 6). MVA-BN-PRO isbeing developed as a next-generation immunotherapeuticthat may provide a higher frequency of protection or more

Tofurther enhance the activity of this vector, we have targetedPSA or PAP localization to exosomes. Exosome targeting hasbeen shown to improve the antigenicity of poorly immuno-genic proteins (7, 9) and has been explored with DNA vectorsfor improving antitumor efficacy with the model antigen OVA(11). We show here that the immunogenicity of PSA and PAPFigure 4.

can be improved by fusing either protein to the C1C2 domain oflactadherin. Compared with MVA-BN-PRO, treatment of micewith MVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 caused a striking improvement in theimmune response against PAP and significantly enhancedantitumor activity against a PAP-expressing tumor. Similarly,the immune response against PSA was improved in micetreated with MVA-BN-PSA-C1C2, and a trend of enhancedefficacy was also found against a PSA-expressing tumor. Theenhancement of antigenicity was specific to the exosome-targeted antigens, whereas the immunogenicity of the otherwild-type transgene in the constructs was unchanged.Treatment of mice on 2 different genetic backgrounds withMVA-BN-PAP-C1C2 resulted in dramatically higher, morerapidly induced antibody titers against PAP than mice treatedwith viruses encoding wild-type PAP. Wild-type PAP seems tobe a particularly weak B-cell antigen in mice as compared withother transgenic antigens expressed by MVA or even with the
use of PAP mixed in Freund's adjuvant (data not shown).Therefore, it is of particular significance that immunizationwith MVA-BN expressing exosome-targeted PAP led to animproved B-cell response. Exosome targeting also improvedhumoral responses against PSA in C57BL/6 mice, which failedto raise antibodies against PSA when treated with virusesencoding wild-type PSA. This example shows that targeting atumor-associated antigen like PSA for exosome localizationcan improve responses in situations where raising a humoralresponse is very difficult. This may be relevant for treating self-tolerant human patients in whom raising anti-PSA antibodiesis challenging (19).In these experiments, exosome targeting modulated theimmune responses against PSA and PAP differently. Treat-ment of mice with constructs encoding exosome-targeted PSAled to an enhanced cellular response, but the antibody titersagainst PSA were only improved in C57BL/6 mice, and the
induced titers were low. Mice treated with constructs encod-ing exosome-targeted PAP also had an increased cellularresponse, but in contrast to PSA, the humoral response againstPAP was dramatically enhanced in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice.It is unknown why exosome targeting affected the immuneresponses against these 2 antigens differently, but distinctTBS PROPSA-C1C2 PAP-C1C2100n.s.Anti-PAP antibody titerTBS PROPSA-C1C2PAP-C1C2100n.s.TBS PROPSA-C1C2 PAP-C1C21001,00010,000100,00010,00,0001,00010,000100,00010,00,0003,0002,0001,0002,0004,0006,0001,00010,000100,00010,00,000P < 0.01TBS PROPSA-C1C2PAP-C1C2012345P < 0.01P < 0.001Ratio of Anti-PAP titers              IgG2a          IgG2a/IgG1 IgG1 IgG DG F ECB AFigure 5.

antigens induce qualitative and quantitative differences inimmune responses. Furthermore, fusion of the 30-kDa C1C2domain to different proteins could differentially affect avariety of characteristics predicted to affect immunogenicity.These include the efficiency of exosome localization, proteinhalf-life, alterations to protein confirmation caused by theC1C2 fusion, and levels of proteolytic processing.Exosome targeting improved antitumor activity in 2 differ-ent tumor models. Although the immunologic mechanismsbehind the enhanced antitumor efficacy are currentlyunknown, exosome targeting improved both the magnitudeand quality of the immune responses. Mice treated withviruses encoding exosome-targeted PSA or PAP had anincreased frequency of PSA- or PAP-specific T cells comparedwith mice treated with viruses encoding wild-type transgenes.Furthermore, in the context of tumors that promoted Th2-biased immunity against PSA or PAP, only treatment with the
virus encoding the exosome-targeted form of the tumorantigen shifted immunity toward a Th1-biased response.Although the most effective treatments induced a Th1-biasedhumoral response, no direct correlation was observedbetween antibody titers and tumor size when individual micewere analyzed (data not shown). Further work will be neededto determine the contribution of different aspects of immunitytoward the enhanced therapeutic activity. However, the char-acteristics of immune responses provided by vectors encodingexosome-targeted antigens are desirable for treating prostatecancer patients.In summary, this study shows that exosome targeting is aviable method for improving the immunogenicity and ther-apeutic efficacy of viral-based immunotherapies and warrantsfurther investigation of modified PSA and PAP in poxvirusvectors for the treatment of prostate cancer.Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest
