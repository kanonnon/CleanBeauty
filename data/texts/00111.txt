Regulation of Skin Pigmentation and Thickness byDickkopf 1 (DKK1)Yuji Yamaguchi1, Akimichi Morita1, Akira Maeda1and Vincent J. Hearing2Dickkopf 1 (DKK1), an inhibitor of Wnt signaling, notonly functions as a head inducer during development,but also regulates joint remodeling and bone forma-tion, which suggests roles for DKK1 in the patho-genesis of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple myeloma.We recently demonstrated that levels of DKK1 inpalmoplantar dermal fibroblasts are physiologicallyhigher than those observed in non-palmoplantardermal fibroblasts. Thus, the DKK1-rich mesenchymein palmoplantar dermis affects the overlying epithe-lium and induces a palmoplantar phenotype in theepidermis. More specifically, DKK1 suppresses mela-nocyte function and growth through the regulation ofmicrophthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)and b-catenin. Furthermore, DKK1 induces the ex-pression of keratin 9 and a-Kelch-like ECT2-interacting
protein ( aKLEIP) but downregulates the expression ofb-catenin, glycogen synthase kinase 3 b, protein kinaseC, and proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) inkeratinocytes. Treatment of reconstructed skin withDKK1 reproduces the hypopigmentation and thicken-ing of skin through Wnt/ b-catenin signaling. Thesestudies elucidate why human palmoplantar skin isthicker and paler than non-palmoplantar skin throughthe secretion of DKK1 by fibroblasts that affect theoverlying epidermis. Thus, DKK1 may be useful forreducing skin pigmentation and for thickening photo-aged skin and palmoplantar wounds caused bydiabetes mellitus and rheumatic skin diseases.Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings (2009) 14,73–75; doi:10.1038/jidsymp.2009.4INTRODUCTION
73–75; doi:10.1038/jidsymp.2009.4INTRODUCTIONOur research groups have performed a series of collaborativestudies elucidating how human palmoplantar skin is regen-erated using non-palmoplantar skin. Our group reported thathuman palmoplantar skin defects can be treated with non-palmoplantar epidermis (Yamaguchi et al ., 1999), which iseasily obtained from donors without forming scars (Yama-guchi et al ., 2005a). Thin and fragile non-palmoplantarepidermis can differentiate into mechanically strong palmo-plantar epidermis due to the effects of the underlyingpalmoplantar dermis (Yamaguchi et al ., 2001, 2004b,2005b), which is the first clinically proven site-specificregeneration observed for a human tissue. It is paradoxicalthat artificial wound closures using skin flaps and conven-tional skin grafts inhibit ideal regeneration, even in salaman-ders, because those operations interfere with the formation ofthe wound epidermis (Muneoka et al., 2008). We hypothe-
sized that wound coverage with only the epidermalcomponent would not interfere with remodeling of theunderlying microenvironment but nonetheless would en-hance appropriate differentiation. More specifically, we thenestablished that adult human palmoplantar dermis at least inpart determines the fate of the overlying epidermis.These studies indicated that factors regulated by thepalmoplantar dermis could induce the palmoplantar pheno-type in grafted non-palmoplantar epidermis. Chang et al .(2002) recently reported that HOX gene expression patternsobserved in the fetus are retained in adult human fibroblastsusing microarray analyses of various sites of cadaver skin,which suggested that topographically different fibroblastsplay an essential role in regulating the positional identity ofthe epidermis, even in adult tissues. That group subsequentlyproved that noncoding RNAs obtained from fibroblastsregulate the expression patterns of HOX transcription factors
with site specificity (Rinn et al ., 2007) and that HOXA13 ,which is highly expressed in mouse palmoplantar fibroblasts,induces palmoplantar epidermis by the enhancement ofWnt5a (Rinn et al., 2008). Yasuda et al. (2006) reported thatexpression levels of fibronectin are lower in palmoplantarfibroblasts, which may explain why palmoplantar epidermis

(2006) reported thatexpression levels of fibronectin are lower in palmoplantarfibroblasts, which may explain why palmoplantar epidermisdiffers from non-palmoplantar epidermis.Our group identified dickkopf 1 (DKK1), an inhibitor of theWnt-signaling pathway and a head inducer during develop-ment (Glinka et al., 1998), as an abundantly expressed factorin palmoplantar fibroblasts at mRNA (Yamaguchi et al .,&2009 The Society for Investigative Dermatology www.jidonline.org 73REVIEWReceived 14 November 2008; accepted 13 January 20091Department of Geriatric and Environmental Dermatology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan and2Laboratory of CellBiology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USACorrespondence: Dr Yuji Yamaguchi, Department of Geriatric and Environmental Dermatology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Scie nces,

DKK1plays key roles in the development of osteolytic lesions inmultiple myeloma (Tian et al ., 2003) and in the bone-destructive pattern observed in rheumatoid arthritis throughtumor necrosis factor TNF- a(Diarra et al ., 2007). Here,briefly we review the effects of DKK1 on skin pigmentationand thickness by inducing the palmoplantar phenotype.EFFECTS OF DKK1 ON SKIN PIGMENTATIONMelanocytes regulate skin pigmentation (Yamaguchi et al .,2007a), and they are affected by external factors such asultraviolet radiation (Yamaguchi et al., 2006) and by internalfactors secreted from fibroblasts and keratinocytes (Yamagu-chi and Hearing, 2006). We investigated the effects of DKK1secreted by palmoplantar fibroblasts on melanocyte growthand differentiation (Yamaguchi et al ., 2004a). DKK1 (at100 ng ml/C01) suppressed the growth of normal human
/C01) suppressed the growth of normal humanmelanocytes and their function, as measured by expressionlevels of melanogenic proteins, including tyrosinase, dopa-chrome tautomerase, GP100/Pmel17, MART1 and MITF(microphthalmia-associated transcription factor). These ef-fects were mediated by the Wnt/ b-catenin/MITF-signalingpathway, because incubation of melanocytes with DKK1downregulated the expression of b-catenin and glycogensynthase kinase 3 band upregulated the expression of Ser9-phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase3 band proteinkinase C a.We performed microarray analyses and compared geneexpression patterns in normal human melanocytes treatedwith or without DKK1 (Yamaguchi et al., 2007b). The results(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ GSE5515) indicated in-volvement of apoptosis pathways, including tumor necrosisfactor- aand Gadd45, and of melanocyte receptors for DKK1other than LRP5/6 and Kremen1/2, which explains thesuppression of growth and of melanogenesis.
Melanin synthesized in melanosomes within melanocytesis transferred to keratinocytes through the protease-activatedreceptor (PAR)-2 (Seiberg et al., 2000). We investigated theeffects of DKK1 on melanosome transfer and on theexpression of proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) innormal human keratinocytes (Yamaguchi et al ., 2008).DKK1-transfected keratinocytes and DKK1-treated recon-structed skin equivalents showed less melanin uptake thanmock-transfected keratinocytes and non-treated skin equiva-lents, respectively. DKK1 treatment decreased expressionlevels of PAR-2, and the expression of PAR-2 was lower inreconstructed skin equivalents treated with DKK1 and inpalmoplantar epidermis in vivo .Thus, DKK1 not only affects melanocytes and suppressestheir proliferation and differentiation, but it also decreasesmelanin transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes throughthe suppression of PAR-2, explaining why palmoplantarepidermis is hypopigmented.EFFECTS OF DKK1 ON SKIN THICKNESS
EFFECTS OF DKK1 ON SKIN THICKNESSKeratin 9 is a marker for palmoplantar epidermis, because it isexpressed exclusively in suprabasal layers of palmoplantarepidermis and is only sparsely detected in acrosyringia,epidermal keratinocytes around sweat gland ducts and innon-palmoplantar epidermis (Knapp et al ., 1986). We hadalready proven that palmoplantar fibroblasts could inducekeratin 9 expression in non-palmoplantar keratinocytes(Yamaguchi et al., 1999).We investigated whether DKK1 alone can recapitulate thepalmoplantar phenotype in non-palmoplantar keratinocytesin terms of skin thickness (Yamaguchi et al., 2008). Treatmentof keratinocytes with DKK1 resulted in the stimulationof proliferation and density, as measured by the MTTassay and by the average size/area of individual keratino-cytes respectively, as recently reported for human mesen-chymal stem cells (Gregory et al ., 2005).

Palmoplantar fibroblasts secrete high levels of DKK1, whichsuppress the proliferation and melanogenesis of melanocytes throughinhibition of the Wnt/ b-catenin/MITF pathway. DKK1 suppresses the
expression of PAR-2 in keratinocytes, and thereby decreases melanin transfer.DKK1 affects the proliferation and contraction of keratinocytes mainlythrough the increased expression of aKLEIP and keratin 9 and the decreasedexpression of b-catenin. Palmoplantar fibroblasts express higher nuclearlevels of HOXA13 and induce keratin 9 through Wnt5a. They also secrete lowlevels of fibronectin and may play roles in the maintenance and induction ofthe palmoplantar phenotype.

DKK1 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ GSE9211), and weidentified three genes responsible for inducing the thickenedphenotype: keratin 9, aKLEIP, and b-catenin. Keratin 9 seemsto be essential to support the skin against severe mechanicalstimuli. aKLEIP is involved in cytokinesis and cell contraction(Hara et al ., 2004), suggesting that keratinocytes becomesmaller due to severe internal tension. The decreasedexpression of (membranous type) b-catenin may result inthe shrinkage (or the decreased space occupation) of cells(Fedi et al ., 1999). Treatment of keratinocytes with DKK1increased the expression of aKLEIP and keratin 9 anddecreased the expression of b-catenin through regulation ofthe Wnt/ b-catenin-signaling pathway. These expressionpatterns were identical in in vivo specimens.CONCLUSIONS
CONCLUSIONSDKK1 is responsible for thickened and hypopigmentedpalmoplantar epidermis, and it may be useful for inducingthickening of specific skin areas such as photo-aged skin andpalmoplantar wounds caused by diabetic foot ulcers orrheumatic ulcers and/or for reducing skin pigmentation.These cumulative studies elucidate why human palmoplantarskin is thicker and paler than non-palmoplantar skin, due tothe secretion of DKK1 by fibroblasts that affect the overlyingepidermis (Figure 1). We are further investigating theinteraction of DKK1 with Wnt/ b-catenin-signaling pathwaysand several key molecules including PAR-2, aKLEIP, andkeratin 9. HOXA13, Wnt5a, and fibronectin may interactwith DKK1 to regenerate and to maintain the homeostasis ofadult palmoplantar skin.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors state no conflict of interest.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis research was supported by a grant-in-aid from the Ministry of Education,
