REVIEWUndesirable and adverse effects of tooth-whitening products:a reviewMichel Goldberg &Martin Grootveld &Edward LynchReceived: 6 February 2009 /Accepted: 8 June 2009 /Published online: 20 June 2009#Springer-Verlag 2009Abstract Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) is a powerful oxidis-ing agent. It gives rise to agents known to be effectivebleaching agents. The mechanisms of bleaching involve thedegradation of the extracellular matrix and oxidation ofchromophores located within enamel and dentin. However,H2O2produces also local undesirable effects on toothstructures and oral mucosa. In clinical conditions, the dailylow-level doses used to produce tooth whitening nevergenerate general acute and sub-acute toxic effects. Geno-toxicity and carcinogenicity only occur at concentrationsthat are never reached during dental treatments. Sometransient adverse effects have been reported on the oralmucosa and the digestive tract if the product is swallowed.
Local effects may occur on the oral mucosa and dentaltissues during whitening, namely, pulp sensitivity, cervicalresorption, release of selected components of dentalrestorative materials, and alteration of the enamel surface.Most of the local effects are dependent of the technique andconcentration of the product so far used, but as the resultsof bleaching obtained are not stable, repeated treatmentsadd to the adverse effects. The informed decision toadminister or not and the control of bleaching effectsshould stand in the hand of dental surgeons and certainlynot as it appears at present, as cosmetics sold without anyrestriction despite the potential health hazards of peroxides.Keywords Tooth whitening .Hydrogen peroxide .Cytotoxic effects .Genotoxicity .Carcinogenicity .Resorptions .Hypersensitivity .Enamel surfaceIntroductory remarksGenetic diseases such as dentinogenesis imperfecta ,o rdentine dysplasia or some forms of amelogenesis imper-
fecta , some acquired foetal and post-natal pathologiesoccurring during tooth forma tion such as medical diseases(i.e., icterus, congenital erythropoietic porphyria, chole-stasis, and renal diseases), tr eatments with tetracycline, orchronic ingestion of fluoride during childhood, mayinduce unacceptable levels of intrinsic tooth staining thatshould be included in the list of handicaps. In such cases,there is a real need for bleaching, mostly for psychologicalreasons and also for an improved social life of the patient[19,22,49]. Bleaching procedures are effective andcertainly less destructive than any full or partial prostheticrestoration.However, there is currently a wide range of bleachingtechniques used for aesthetic reasons, and in many cases,such treatments are not necessary. As a consequence, thewide diffusion of whitening methods have to becontrolled because it is well known that there is notherapy without high or small risks. When these methods
are used correctly, there are only minor consequencesand, therefore, a clinical tolerability. In contrast, abusesapproach the limits of risks and this should be taken intoClin Oral Invest (2010) 14:1 –10DOI 10.1007/s00784-009-0302-4M.

consideration or better documented prior to taking aclinical decision.Tooth-whitening treatments are carried out either atthe chair-side by dental surgeons ( ‘in-office ’)o rb y‘staff-supervised in-office bleaching ’,o ra s ‘at-home ’dentist-supervised treatments, or bleaching devices aresold over-the-counter (OTC) to patients and may be usedwithout any control of dental practitioners [ 11,19]. Eachmethod is effective for most staining but needs differentperiods of time to obtain the expected result. When stripsare used as typical OTC treatments, 31.85 cycles of15 min are necessary to obtain some whitening; whereas,at-home dentist-supervised bleaching needs 7.15 cyclesand in-office treatment needs 3.15 cycles [ 11].In many countries, no final decision has yet been takenby state agencies for sanitary security to classify thebleaching agents as medical devices or cosmetic products,
or both, depending on the final concentration of the gel.Whatever the decision will be in this matter, up to now, theactive compounds are, in general, the same although thedoses administered can differ substantially. Between 1918[1] and the 1990s [ 66], sporadically, a few publicationsreported that bleaching could be obtained clinically, butmost studies were published in the last 20 years [ 9,69].Bleaching effects are mostly based on the effects ofcarbamide peroxide, releasing about 33% of their contentas hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H 2O2can act as a powerfuloxidising agent and can give rise to agents known to beeffective bleaching agents (i.e., its corresponding mono-anion (HO2−) and hydroxyl radical (OH)). In addition,carbamide peroxide also releases urea, which is rapidlydecomposed into carbon dioxide and ammonia [ 22,41].Chemical reaction of the two reagents with the organicextracellular matrix components (ECM), including pig-
ments or chromophores, constitutes the chemical basis oftooth whitening.It is well documented that urea degrades the organicmatrix located in the enamel [ 8,31,32]. The organic matrixconstitutes 0.6% in weight and 4% in volume of the totalhuman adult enamel. Urea and ammonium ions (NH4)+acton the hydrogen bounds that are crucial regarding thesecondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of matrixproteins. After the initial alteration, the degraded proteinsare further split into small peptides, released, and finallyeliminated from the mature enamel [ 8,31,32,41,57]. Thesame applies to most non-c ollagenous dentin matrixcomponents. The empty minute spaces that are renderedaccessible by urea allow the diffusion of hydrogen peroxidethroughout the whole thickness of enamel up to thedentino-enamel junction (DEJ).Bleaching agents cross the DEJ and interact in thesubjacent dentin with the chromophores, pigments, and ions
that are now recognised to be responsible for tooth staining.The removal of ECM is not homogeneous. In enamel, it ismostly detectable in some rods and not apparentlyassociated with inter-rods [ 31,32]. The removal of matrixcomponents is associated with the loss of some hydroxy-apatite crystals, bound at specific areas where there is alocal accumulation of matrix components. Consequently,minute craters form at the enamel surface as a reaction to anefficient peroxide treatment [ 24,60,62,93]. The balancebetween the need for treatment that is judged necessary bythe practitioner and the risk induced by the therapy has toreach a valuable equilibrium. It is clear that many efforts ofthe industry were carried out in order to minimise thenoxious effects of bleaching products. However, there isclearly a compromise between efficiency and safety thatcannot be ignored [ 11,19].Adverse effects of bleaching agents have been reported
after the treatment of non-vital teeth [ 69]. When applied tovital teeth, tooth sensitivities, the alteration of enamelsurfaces, and the consequences arising from the release ofsome components of restorative materials have been
vital teeth, tooth sensitivities, the alteration of enamelsurfaces, and the consequences arising from the release ofsome components of restorative materials have beenreported [ 22] and are important phenomena to consider.The effects on the oral mucosa are controversial and dependon the technique that has been employed. It is also the casethat the effects of bleaching agents on the digestive tracts ofboth animals and humans have to be considered in detail.The conclusions of in vitro and animal studies should beadapted to the human situation. Finally, general toxicity,genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity are also important con-siderations that have to be taken into account in the frameof safety or tolerability [ 57,82,85].A review of the potential effects of bleaching agents isnot facile, largely because of the many divergent reportsthat have been published on a range of important aspectsof this area. There are multiple reasons for these
conflicting reports. In some cases, what has beenpublished arises more from the marketing and advertise-ment of products rather than that from unbiased scientificinvestigations, and it is not always a simple process todecide what has to be kept on the list of reputablereferences. In many cases, however, diverging publisheddata are mostly attributable to differences between theconcentrations of the bleaching reagent that was used,the reagent itself, and even the carrier, which may alsoplay an important role in the reaction (or lack of it). Inany case, taking into account the many excellent reportsthat are available, it is necessary to consider the limitabove which there is a risk of undesirable side effects.An excellent review article has been published in 2003,and we have to acknowledge that it constitutes one of themajor references in the field [ 22]. However, since the last6–7 years, new experimental results were obtained and
new products were put on the market. These additionaldata are incorporated in this review.2 Clin Oral Invest (2010) 14:1 –10
General and local toxic effects of hydrogen peroxideAllergic sensitivityNo allergic sensitivity has yet been reported for carbamideor hydrogen peroxides, or for alternative peroxo-adducts, incontrast to the acute and sub-acute effects that are welldocumented.Acute cytotoxic effectsAcute cytotoxic effects appear at doses over 5 g/kg/day fora product containing 10% ( w/w) carbamide peroxide [ 44,88]. This corresponds to a 0.3 to 1.8 mg/kg (body weight)/day H2O2. Force-feeding rats directly into the stomach with5, 15, and 50 mg of carbamide peroxide/kilogramme, or itsequivalent in tooth-whitening products, induce dose-dependent ulcerations of the mucosa, easily detectable 1 hafter feedings; however, these heal after 24 h. This reactionis not observed for doses lower than 15 mg/kg. The gelassociated with peroxides in a commercially availableproduct seems to enhance the toxic effects. No adverseeffect has been detected in the kidney or liver [ 21].
From these data, assuming a threshold of toxicity of15 mg of carbamide peroxide/kilogramme and a securityfactor of 100, it is apparent that at a carbamide peroxideconcentration of 10 mg (equivalent to 3.6% ( w/v)H2O2),we are at the limit of systemic effects for a 70-kg man [ 21].In this context, it has been reported that a 16-month-oldchild died after ingestion of a 3% ( w/v)H2O2solution.However, this accident was at the lowest doses so farreported. From the available data, we can conclude that theeveryday doses used during whitening procedures is closeto a level where adverse systemic effects might occur.Sub-acute toxic effectsThere are no effects or, at least, no reported effects inhumans. In animals, the daily critical doses should belower than 30 mg/kg/day for the rat and 26 mg/kg/dayfor the mouse.After topical application to humans, °OH radicalderived from electron transfer to H2O2can, in principle,induce lipid peroxidation, and also DNA alteration
followed by cell lysis and death [ 41,57]. Anti-oxidantsand iron chelators may prevent such reactions, the formerby scavenging °OH or lipid peroxyl radicals (LOO°), thelatter by complexing Fe(II) and attenuating its ability toparticipate in Fenton-type reactions. The enzyme catalaseinhibits these reactions via its capacity to directly consumeH2O2; whereas, the lipid-sol uble antioxidant vitamin E(α-tocopherol) blocks such damage by scavenging LOO°radicals [ 57,82].H2O2induces squamous metaplasia on tracheal explantsat concentrations of 50 –100μmol/l; whereas, cytotoxiceffects appear at a concentration ≥500μmol/l [ 71]. At700μmol/l, H 2O2induces embryonic fibroblast necrosis;whereas, at 150 μmol/l, apoptotic effects are induced [ 34].In another report, it is shown that when 35% ( w/v)carbamide peroxide is used, the percentage of viable cellsis decreased to 60% in comparison with control cells
(FM3A cell line). This value falls down to 43% with a 20%(w/w) carbamide peroxide gel. The level of toxicity is 50and 40 μg/ml, respectively. An extrapolation to a 70-kgindividual suggests that in order to remain below the riskdoses and avoid any toxic effects, the daily dose usedshould be ≤10 mg carbamide peroxide, or its 3.3 mg H2O2equivalent [ 7].Genotoxicity and carcinogenicityInternational Agency on Research on Cancer data [ 44]d on o trefer to any mutation or cancer risk attributable to profes-sional exposure. However, in animal models, adenoma andduodenum carcinoma have been detected experimentallyafter oral administration of H2O2. In the mouse, hyperplasiaappears in the gastric mucosa in 20 –42% and duodenumhyperplasia in 40 –62% of the experimental animals 8 weekssubsequent to the ingestion of 0.10% or 0.40% ( w/v)H 2O2solutions. These reactions are more substantial in theduodenum than the stomach. In addition to gastric mucosal
ulcerations after force-feeding with 15 mg/kg carbamideperoxide, adenoma and carcinoma were observed. This
duodenum than the stomach. In addition to gastric mucosalulcerations after force-feeding with 15 mg/kg carbamideperoxide, adenoma and carcinoma were observed. Thispathological transformation seems to be strain-dependentand linked specifically to the catalase activity of the differentgroups of mice [ 45–47]. Critical analysis of the experimentalsituation leads to conclude that hydrogen peroxide is not acarcinogenic thread, at least for the digestive tract [ 23].It seems unlikely that H2O2may induce cutaneous cancers[13,52]. In the oral cavity, repeated applications of 30%(w/w)H2O2produce hyperkeratosis, hyperplasia, and dyspla-sia with weak intensity after 22 weeks [ 71,89]H o w e v e r ,n otumours were detectable with H 2O2alone. This is not the casewhen a carcinogenetic agent is co-administered with H 2O2[89]. However, it is documented that H 2O2inhibits gapjunctional intercellular co mmunication in glutathione-
sufficient but not in glutathione-deficient cells, and anaberrant intercellular junctional communication has beenimplicated in tumour promoti on, neuropathy, and teratogen-esis. This sheds light on potential dangers and on somegenetic aspects of the reaction [ 87].H2O2has been shown to be mutagenic in a number ofstrains including Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichiacoli [2]. In some cell cultures, H 2O2treatment inducesDNA strand breakage and is mutagenic, especially towardcells from the L5178Y murine lymphoma subline. ForClin Oral Invest (2010) 14:1 –10 3
example, at 37°C, LY-R are 3.6 times more sensitive to thekilling effects than LY-S cells; whereas, at 4°C, they were11 times more sensitive [ 53]. Mutagenicity has also beenreported in V79 Chinese hamster cells, and the reaction isconcentration dependent. Ziegler-Skylakakis and Andrae[94] concluded from their investigations that at a solutionlevel of 4 mM H 2O2, the mutation frequency increasedsixfold above the controls, and the extent of survival wasreduced by 50%. DNA fragmentation has also beenobserved in human lymphocyte cultures and epithelial cellsof the respiratory tract.Following the use of hydrogen peroxide at a concentra-tion of (10 μmol/L), Timblin et al. [ 84] observed theoverexpression of the proto-oncogen c-jun , a process whichleads to cell proliferation.It should be added that despite all the potential risksinherent with the use of peroxides, up to now there is no
report of human cases where carcinogenic effects areactually established [ 23,57]. However, two recent publica-tions pointed out that hydrogen peroxide used in long-termtreatment and at a high concentration might act as apromoter of oral mucosal damage and, moreover, havegenotoxic and carcinogenic effects [ 65,85].Local effects of bleaching agents on dental tissuesand oral mucosaThe whitening effects of hydrogen peroxide on teethand oral mucosa are well documented [ 11,18,49,55,67]. However, in a limited number of cases, undesirableeffects such as hypersensitivity (2.62 –3.38%) and gingivalirritation (0.23 –0.85%) have been reported [ 11,54].Changes in enamel microhardness, micromorphologicaldefects due to demineralization, and effects on restorativematerials have also been reported [ 17,24,43,60,62,64,68,77,80,81,90–93].Effects on non-vital teeth (internal and/or external treatment):internal and external resorptions
internal and external resorptionsSome time after a root canal treatment, the colour of thetreated tooth changes and gradually becomes unaesthetic[74]. This is very often the case for incisors after a localtrauma. Darker or brown-grey teeth may be subjected to awhitening treatment that removes less dental tissue thanthe preparation of a jacket crown or a veneer. In moststudies, however, no adverse reaction has been observedafter such treatments. Indeed , no resorption was detectedin a series of 100 and 250 patients, respectively, that havebeen treated and recalled for a follow-up [ 6,42]. However,external resorptions have also been reported in a furtherseries of patients. About 7% of the teeth displayedresorptions in 58 cases, monitored during an 8-year period[26]. The frequency of resorption is certainly dependenton the bleaching method that has been utilised. A mixtureof sodium perborate and 3% hydrogen peroxide wasshown to induce delayed outer resorptions, which
shown to induce delayed outer resorptions, whichappeared 12 years after the treatment. Heating thebleaching solution enhances the number of resorptionsthat are induced [ 69].Exactly why such external resorptions are occurring ispoorly understood. They seem to be dependent on the pH,the trauma, and the heating procedure that was used. Theyappear a few years after the bleaching treatment, and weare still unable to control them. The origin of thepathology could be an enhancement of bacterial penetra-tion inside dentine tubules [ 40]. This invading pathwaymay be also related to some structural defects or patholog-ical alterations of the cementum that favour such bacterialpenetration [ 74]. Apparently, no correlation was foundbetween the mechanism of action of sodium perborate andthe adhesive properties of macrophages. It seems that thesecells do not play a role in the resorption process [ 48].Tissue permeability in the cervical area of the tooth may be
implicated in the initiation of such resorptions. However,there is no predictable evidence from clinical examinationthat such lesions will form. Therefore, before taking the
implicated in the initiation of such resorptions. However,there is no predictable evidence from clinical examinationthat such lesions will form. Therefore, before taking thedecision to administer a whitening treatment on non-vitalteeth, it is important to consider that resorption may beinduced. The final outcome of such cervical resorption isthe fracture of the crown, when the lesion reaches a certainvolume. This, unfortunately, leads to a residual root thatcannot be employed for a prosthetic device and, hence, hasto be extracted.Effects of external treatments on vital teethPost-treatment hypersensitivity and pulp alterationWhen a 10% ( w/w) carbamide peroxide treatment isconducted, between 15% and 65% of the patients receivingit display sensitivities of the treated teeth within the next4d a y s[ 38,54,78], far less for other authors (2.62 –3.38%)depending on the bleaching product and the concentrationused [ 11]. The sensitivity is higher with H2O2combined with
2O2combined withthe thermo-catalytic enhancement at some point followingthe chair-side treatments [ 69]. This sensitivity may last up to39 days and, in some cases, is so painful that it leads totreatment interruption. It is well documented that H2O2diffuses throughout the enamel layer and dentine, even invital teeth. In vitro studies demonstrate peroxide penetrationinto the pulp with most bleaching agents and methods,including whitening strips that presumably would excerptmild effects [ 28–30]. This phenomenon results from both theosmotic and vascular pressures [ 35]. The physiopathological4 Clin Oral Invest (2010) 14:1 –10
mechanisms of sensitivity or pain are however not fullyunderstood. Nerve endings are undetectable in enamel.Contemporarily, it is well documented that nerve endingsare present in the inner dentin in an area near theperiphery of the pulp (150 μm thick), visualised either byradioautography [ 15] or by immunocytochemistry [ 58]. Theabsence of nerve endings in the outer dentine and at the DEJclearly does not assist us in interpreting the phenomenon.The hydrodynamic hypothesis developed by Brännström[14] may apply here, i.e., backward and forward movementof the “dentinal lymph ”may be transmitted to odontoblastprocesses located inside tubules and then to cell bodieswhere a direct anatomical link occurs between odontoblastsand nerve endings in what is known as the sub-odontoblasticplexus. Bleaching agents containing H2O2in high concen-tration may favour bacterial penetration through dentinaltubules [ 40]. In view of the mild irritative process,
reactionary dentine is formed which gradually reduces thehypersensitivity. Alternatively, there is peritubular dentineformation after such stimulation, resulting in an eventualreduction of diameter of the lumen of the tubules. The twoprocesses may be interdependent.Diverging results have been published with respect tothe consequences of the influence of whitening treatmentson pulp. According to Seale et al. [ 79], a 35% ( w/v)hydrogen peroxide gel used for 30 min induces severe pulpreactions in dog teeth. The odontoblast layer is reduced andeven disappears in the area facing the treated part of thetooth. The predentine is missing. Inflammatory cells arepresent at the pulp surface, and internal resorbing processesmay be observed 4 days after the treatment. The inflam-matory reaction is present for a period of 15 days, togetherwith the dilation of blood vessels, vascular thrombus, andhaemorrhages. Fortunately, these alterations disappear after
2 months. Another report reveals translocation of odonto-blast nuclei in dentinal tubules in 32% to 53% of treatedhuman teeth, without any pulp reaction [ 20]. The differ-ences between these two reports do not appear to beascribable to compositional differences between the twobleaching agents which were used, since they bothcontained 35% ( w/w)H2O2coupled with thermal enhance-ment. A more recent study provides evidence for amoderate reaction with 10% ( w/w) carbamide peroxide[5]. Moreover, it should be noted that bleaching methodsinduce an increase of endogenous pulp peroxide (meanvalue, 0.44 mM). However, this was 3,000 less than thatwhich can induce acute pulp damages arising from enzymerelease [ 50]. In any case, tooth sensitivity resumesgradually, without any long-term adverse effects.Sensitivity can be prevented or decreased by treating theteeth 30 min prior to whitening by desensitising agentscontaining 3% potassium nitrate and 0.11% per weight
fluoride [ 56].Alteration of enamel surface: consequences on bacterialplaque adhesion and cariogenicityIn this area, reports on the effects of whitening gels are alsodivergent. Some researchers have reported either no effecton or only minor changes to the enamel surface or thesubsurface [ 18,37,50,51,64,90–92]. In contrast, othershave shown moderate to severe enamel surface modifica-tions [ 24,27,60,62,80,93]. Again, it is difficult to have aclear-cut idea on the actual situation. The divergent resultsthat were obtained are mainly attributable to differences inthe protocols, the chemicals that were used and theirconcentrations, and also may be influenced by the methodused to visualise the effects. In some case, the reliability ofthe results is related also to the scientific independency ofthe researcher and is also apparently linked to the scientificquality of the journal where the report is published.Although some authors have pointed out that tooth

quality of the journal where the report is published.Although some authors have pointed out that toothbleaching with selected commercial H2O2or carbamideperoxide do not produce modifications in surface morphol-ogy [ 81–83], another group of reports found that bleachingagents create some enamel porosity [ 21,54,56,84]. Forexample, Ruse et al. [ 77] have shown that in bleachedenamel, the calcium/phosphate ratio is altered by a 35%H2O2treatment. According to Seghi and Denry [ 80],enamel treated with a 10% ( w/w) carbamide peroxide geldisplays a reduction in apparent fracture toughness (ca.30%), with no significant changes in surface hardness. Dataacquired indicate small but significant decreases in abrasionresistance. To explain these findings, the authors hypoth-esised that the chemical action of H2O2induced analteration of the organic matrix of enamel. Differencesbetween these published reports may arise from a variation
in the concentration of chemical bleaching agents, e.g., aconcentration of 35% ( w/w) carbamide peroxide (11 –12%H2O2) affects the structure of enamel; whereas, 10% or16% ( w/w) have no effect [ 68]. From the publishedliterature, it could be concluded that bleaching treatmentsinduce changes in surface roughness and consequentlyinfluence the formation of supra- and sub-gingival plaque[70]. Therefore, the adhesion of Streptococcus mutans toenamel is increased [ 43]. This is also the case forStreptococcus sobrinus , but not for Actinomyces viscosus[63]. Such undesirable effect may have some implication onfuture developments regarding the carious decay. However,to the best of our knowledge, it should be recognised thatup to now, there are no clinical report available on thepotential development of caries from a broad series ofwhitening treatments. However, it may be assumed thatwith the development of such methods, we may face suchconsequences in the near future.
An investigation performed with the atomic forcemicroscope revealed that commercial bleaching agents asClin Oral Invest (2010) 14:1 –10 5
well as a 30% ( w/v)H2O2solution enhanced groves presentat the surface of enamel and also act on its inner structure[39]. Hence, it may be concluded that most bleachingagents (even those containing 10% ( w/v) carbamideperoxide), induce slight to moderate alterations of theenamel surface and a decreased enamel microhardness,variations between the bleaching agents employed wereclearly notable [ 73]. These microlesions are of much lesserimportance than those arising from etching with phosphoricacid. From some reports, it appears that minor defects arealso induced in the subsurface. These defects mightinterfere with the adhesive properties of restorative materials.After some time, the porosities are gradually reduced. In viewof enamel abrasion, and also as a result of ion re-precipitationcontrolled by some salivary proteins and/or by the bacterialplaque, calcium-phosphate precipitation occurs inside theporous enamel, a phenomenon that leads eventually to re-
hardening and furthermore contributes to a return to thenormal situation.Therefore, the concept that “in-office ”bleaching is anon-destructive cosmetic procedure should be reconsidered,and this apply also to the other whitening procedures. Itshould be considered that enamel demineralization is anundesirable effect resulting from bleaching agents, relatedto their concentration and to the time necessary to obtainteeth whitening. Along this line, strips may have lessdestructive effects, although peroxide release in saliva ishigher by using some strips in comparison with trayscharged with gels [ 36]. Remineralization due to saliva mayrestore gradually the mineral charge of enamel surfaces, butthe specific organic matrix is definitively degraded, and thisalteration may interfere with enamel repair. Attempts toreduce the loss of mineral and the formation of micro-defects on enamel surface were carried out with fluoride-
containing bleaching agents shown to induce less enamelsurface demineralization and altered microhardness [ 17].Effects of tooth-whitening peroxides on the oral and gastricmucosaWhen the dental surgeon at the chair-side applies H2O2oralternative peroxo-adducts, there is a clinical control of therisk factor for developing gingival irritation. This is notalways the case with nightguard, i.e., dentist-prescribedhome-applied bleaching methods. The situation may beeven worse when patients without any control of a dentalsurgeon are using whitening methods. Carefully adaptedtrays are mandatory if the dental practitioner wishes toprevent or suppress gingival irritations.H2O2, together with lauroyl and benzoyl peroxides, allrepresent compounds with the potential to generate freeradical species. They are not carcinogenic when appliedtopically to the mouse skin, but they are potent skinirritants. Notable modifications induced by peroxides in
skin are epidermal hyperplasia and the induction of darkkeratinocytes: 15% or 30% ( w/v)H 2O2gave rise to anextensive epidermolysis, inflammation, and vascular injuryin rodents. This was found to be followed by a rapidregeneration and epidermal hyperplasia [ 52]. After topicalapplication of 10% ( w/v) carbamide peroxide, an increase inthe quantity of cells located in the basal layer of the oralmucosa revealed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen(PCNA) staining was noted [ 3]. However, by immunode-tection of cyclin D and p16 (representing a proliferationmarker and a negative regula tor of cell proliferation,respectively, the alteration of which are considered asmarkers of an initial cancer formation), studies carried outon the oral mucosa failed to indicate any significantalteration [ 33]. In contrast, using the PCNA as a marker,the same researchers have shown a transient proliferation
after topical application of carbamide peroxide to the basaland suprabasal epithelial oral border [ 3]. Therefore, thecontroversy is not yet solved.In fact, temporary burnings of the tissue arising fromH
controversy is not yet solved.In fact, temporary burnings of the tissue arising fromH2O2have been reported. In the hamster pouch, severeinflammatory processes are now well identified. Duringthe treatment of periodontal diseases, the bacteriostaticproperties of H 2O2have been widely used, and in thiscontext, cell lysis has been reported at a concentration aslow as 1% [ 61].Carefully adapted plastic trays or nightguards mayreduce the amount of whitening agent that is expelled ontothe oral mucosa when the patient overfills the tray. Stripsand painted lacquers reduce the risk. The ingestion ofbleaching gel may produce gastric pain, although therepeated ingestion of peroxide-containing gels does notseem to have severe consequences.Effects on restorative materials: the release of mercuryand silver from amalgams and adverse effectson the adhesive properties and on the marginof composites fillingsBleaching agents have well-established effects on dental
fillings [ 4,10]. After treatment of silver amalgam with agel containing 10% ( w/w) carbamide peroxide, an increasedlevel of mercury and silver was found near the surface ofsilver amalgam; whereas, tin and copper levels therein werediminished [ 75,76]. In vitro, carbamide peroxide favours therelease of mercury from silver amalgams. However, in vivo,the reaction is limited by the dental biofilm [ 83]. Mercurycan be released up to 80 h after whitening treatment [ 72].Such effects have been reported exclusively for silveramalgam fillings. These effects are not clinically detectablebut have been reported from in vitro studies for othermaterials used in restorative dentistry. There are nowadays6 Clin Oral Invest (2010) 14:1 –10
convincing evidences that bleaching agents may influencebacterial adhesion, modify the surface roughness ofpolyacid-modified resin-based composites and resin-modified glass ionomer cements (see for review [ 10]).The interfacial fracture toughness of dentin/resin compositeadhesive is affected, with significant reductions observed at16% and 21% ( w/w) carbamide peroxide concentrations,after 42 h [ 25]. The marginal leakage of resin compositerestorations is increased after bleaching with 10% ( w/w)carbamide peroxide, but not amalgam restorations [ 86].Penetration of the pulp chamber by bleaching agents iscommon with resin-modified glass ionomer cement fillings;whereas, the lowest pulpal peroxide penetration is detectedwith the resin composite materials [ 28]. A 6% ( w/w)H2O2does not cause significant surface dissolution of glassionomer, but the authors did not investigate the dentin-glassionomer cement (GIC) interface [ 59].
ionomer cement (GIC) interface [ 59].Altogether, these data suggest that whitening treatmentsmay induce alterations of the restorative material itself,impairs the conversion of dental adhesives after dentinwhitening, or modify the interface between the biomaterialand dentine to the detriment of adhesive properties [ 10,16].Moreover, if the restorative material is present in thebleached surfaces, a significant reduction in the resincomposite shear bond strength can be observed [ 12,81].The long-term effects of such methods are questionablein terms of public health costs, especially when they areused without the control of a dental surgeon.Stability of tooth-whitening treatments and acquiredexogenous stainingIt is now well established that bleaching methods areefficient. After a few days or appointments at the chair-side,teeth lost one or two colour divisions on a tooth shadedevice, and patients are generally satisfied from the gain
that is obtained. However, after some time, the initialstaining colour returns, or in view of dental enamelpermeability, a renewed level of exogenous staining agentspenetrates and diffuses throughout enamel and even reachesdentine [ 19]. This is the case for tobacco smoke, tea, coffee,jams, and many other potential staining agents. As long asdental surgeons control the process, it is not an acuteproblem. However, when identified by the patient, thestaining instability may lead to uncontrolled multipletreatments and, hence, the repeated re-exposure of enameland gingiva to peroxo derivatives. It is also clear that thepatient ’s conception of white teeth is mentally mediated andrelated more to social and sexual concepts rather than to areality, but the end-point will be that some individuals willunnecessarily over-use whitening devices. As a conse-quence, demineralisations and local severe structural alter-
ations may occur as a long-term effect of repeatedbleaching, and sub-toxic or toxic doses may be inadver-tently attained. The percentage of such patients is notknown at present. Another open question is that ontreatment with 10% to 15% ( w/w) carbamide peroxide,efficient whitening results are easily and rapidly obtained.To be equivalent to a process involving 10 –15% ( w/w)carbamide peroxide for 2 weeks, a treatment conductedwith a lower concentration such as 5% ( w/w) should beperformable for ca. 3 weeks. Although in the lattertreatment the dose of peroxide is lowered, the time requiredto reach a whitening effect is of course extended.Consequently, lower doses will involve longer treatments,although it could be argued that noxious effects may besimilar [ 11,55].Finally, in order to match the colour of previouslyplaced restorative material with the shade obtained afterbleaching on natural teeth, fillings have to be replaced.
Because tooth whitening is not stable, the colour of thefillings differs gradually from the frontal teeth and theyneed again to be renewed [ 19]. We reach here the limits
Because tooth whitening is not stable, the colour of thefillings differs gradually from the frontal teeth and theyneed again to be renewed [ 19]. We reach here the limitsof what can be acceptable between a dentistry primarilyoriented on cosmetology and the biomedical clinicalpractise.ConclusionsDespite the rather contradictory conclusions arising from ananalysis of the literature, it appears that the chemicalmechanisms of bleaching agent actions involve alterationor destruction of the enamel organic matrix, a phenomenonthat allows the diffusion of peroxides throughout enameltoward dentin where the chromophores are oxidativelydecolourised. From an analysis of the available data, we canconclude that1. Bleaching causes small defects at the surface andsubsurface of enamel.2. Dentin permeability is probably modified and, as aconsequence, post-treatment transient tooth sensitivityis observed in many cases.3. The effects on pulp are more controversial and may be
inconsistent. Nevertheless, chronic treatment withperoxides may be not safe, and this could be the casewhen such treatments are carried out in the absence ofa sufficient level of control by dental surgeons.4. Effects observed regarding dental restorations are wellrecognised, there is a release of mercury fromamalgam fillings, and bleaching methods alter theinterface between dental tissues and glass ionomercements or resin composites.5. The bleaching of non-vital teeth may induce resorp-tion in the cervical area in an unpredictable manner.Clin Oral Invest (2010) 14:1 –10 7
6. The long-term effect of bleaching on the developmentof carious decay has not yet been demonstrated butcannot be ignored.7. Gingival lesions appear in relation to the uncontrolledapplications of whitening gels. Again, the cellular andtissular mechanisms of peroxide damage are wellelucidated, and again there is a critical requirement forqualified control in order to avoid long-term gingivaltissue damage.8. The ingestion of peroxide may occur when poorlyadapted trays are employed.9. At the doses that are administered, it is clear that upuntil now, there is no indication of any effects in termsof general toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicityin human. Therefore, there is a clinical tolerability. Itis also clear that below a 3.6% ( w/w)H2O2concen-tration (10% ( w/w) carbamide peroxide), there isapparently no toxic or sub-toxic risk.10. Taking into account the possibility that chronic treat-ments might be applied as cosmetic products that are
sold OTC, the higher concentrations utilised shouldperhaps be revised.Altogether, all these local effects have to be taken intoconsideration prior to deciding if a whitening treatment isnecessary or, for that matter, safe. Potential patients shouldbe warned. There is a balance between the effects that mayor may not appear and the real need for bleaching. In manycases, it seems rather an artificial cosmetic fashionrequirement than a deserving cause. Finally, the informedand appropriate decision to administer or not, and thecontrol of bleaching effects should stand in the hand ofdental surgeons (or at least be under their control), andcertainly not as it appears at present, as cosmetics soldwithout any restriction despite the potential health hazardsof peroxides.Conflicts of interest We have no conflict of interest.References1.
