ABSTRACT Background : Oligopeptide- 20 acts as positive regulator of cell proliferation and increases collagen and hyaluronic acid levels in keratinocyte and fibroblast cultures. Methods : After randomization half the face of twenty volunteers was treated twice daily for two months with the oligopeptide -20 cream  (0.003 % w/w , 300  ppm ) and the other half with the vehicle. Skin bioengineering was used to estimate the effects on human skin. Results : The average number and width of wrinkles (Sew, 11.7 %, p < 0.05) and cyclic average roughness (cR3, 12.2 %, p < 0.005)  were improved. Sesc parameter , indicative of stratum corneum dehydration was affected almost equally by the oligopeptide and the vehicle cream (p < 0.1). Volunteers noted statistically significant improvement rega rding fine wrinkles and skin brightness on the peptide treated side , whereas the skin smoothness was improved on both  sides. No significant changes in pigmentation meas-
ured by Mexameter were recorded. No significant changes in transepidermal water loss values were demonstrated , in-dicating oligopeptide -20 does not affect the skin barrier. No serious adverse or side effects were observed. Additionally , the oligopeptide cream was not irritant according to  48 h semi-occluded patch test. Conclusion : Oligopeptide- 20 could be a useful and safe ingredient of anti-aging cosmetics.

Introduction Peptides as cosmeceutical ingredients, evolved from re-search into wound healing and studies on growth stimu-lation of human skin fibroblasts [1,2]. In recent years there has been increased interest in the use of that signal peptides in the management of aging [3-5]. Palmitoyl pentapeptide-4 (Pal KTTKS) is a procollagen pentapep-tide fragment [6] which stimulates collagen I and III and
fibronectin production by fibroblasts in vitro and has been shown to decrease skin roughness and wrinkles and fine lines [7] after 4 month application. Copper tripep-tide-1 is thought to improve skin firmness and texture, fine lines and hyperpigmentation [8]. Oligopeptide-20 is another synthetic peptide consisted of the following 12 amino acids: Arg-Arg-Leu-Glu-Met-Tyr-Cys-Ala-Pro- Leu-Lys-Pro [9]. It acts as positive regulator of cell pro-liferation and increases colla gen and hyaluronic acid lev-els in keratinocyte and fibroblast cultures. In vitro de-creases apoptosis rates and increases cell attachment,  which is a significant part of wound healing and skin regeneration [10]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study in the bibliography regarding the clinical effi-cacy of cosmetic products containing oligopeptide-20. As a part of our research program on anti-aging and cosmeceutical agents [11-15], we thought it would be of
interest to examine by m eans of a randomized, vehicle controlled, double blind study the anti-aging properties of a cream containing 0.003% w/w (300 ppm) of the
interest to examine by m eans of a randomized, vehicle controlled, double blind study the anti-aging properties of a cream containing 0.003% w/w (300 ppm) of the newly synthesized oligopeptide-20. We have used five different assessment methods to examine the effect of topical oligopeptide-20 treatment on the skin: Four non- invasive, bioengineering, objective techniques proposed by EEMCO Group (European Group in Efficacy Meas-urement of Cosmetics and Other Topical Products) and subjective self-evaluation. Skin surface morphology was examined by a direct non-inv asive method with the in-strument Skin VisioscanVC98 [16]. Skin microtopogra-phy was examined by optical profilometry (negative rep-
Efficacy and Tolerance Study of an Oligopeptide with Potential Anti-Aging Activity 134 lica method), which is a useful non-invasive method in trials estimating the effectiv eness of anti-wrinkle prepa-rations [17-22]. Pigmentation was examined by the melanin index measurement (Mexameter) [23,24]. The effect of the peptide on skin barrier was also investigated. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurement can screen ingredients that have effect on barrier function and offer the possibility to monitor in vivo on human skin the effect of topical treatment  in an objective and non- invasive way [25,26]. Additionally, assessment of skin tolerance of the oligopeptid e-20 cream was performed [27,28]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Treatment Creams Creams contained identical vehicle.

Ingredients: Aqua, C12-20 Acid PEG Ester, Glyceryl Stearate (and) PEG-100 Steara te, Cetyl Alcohol, Dime-thicone, Octyl Palmitate, Xanthan Gum, Propylene Gly-col, Propylparaben, Methylparaben, Imidazolidinyl Urea, BHT. 2.2. Equipment Skin surface evaluation: Skin Visioscan VC98 (Courage and Khazaka, Cologne, Germ any). Skin profilometry: Skin Visiometer SV600FW, Melanin content: Mexame-ter MX18 (MPA5, Courage and Khazaka, Cologne, Germany). Transepidermal water loss: Tewameter TM300 (Courage and Khazaka, Cologne, Germany). 2.2.1. Efficacy Study 2.2.1.1. Volunteers Twenty females and two males (age 35 - 75, mean age 55 years) were included in this  study. They were selected according to following inclusion criteria: Discontinuation of treatments by products containing retinoids, a-hydroxyacids and other anti-aging treatments at least six months before the beginning of the study.  2.2.1.2. Signed Informed Consent
2.2.1.2. Signed Informed Consent Avoidance of medication such as steroid hormone re-placement, birth control pills and vitamin supplements during the study period. At the baseline visit, the partici-pants were instructed not to apply or take orally any other anti-wrinkle products/food supplements and not to apply at each visit, any product on the previous 12 hours. 2.2.1.3. Study Procedure The procedure was done according to good clinical prac-tice (GCP) guidelines. Volunteers were visited at the baseline (D0) and D20, D40 and D60. Skin surface evaluation, sk in microtopography, mela-nin content, transepidermal  water loss and were meas-ured before (D0), during (D20, D40) and after the treat-ment (D60) and self-evaluation was performed by the test subject before (D0) and after 2-month treatment (D60). Side effects were also evaluated by the volun-teers. Two coded 50 g vessels, marked right and left, respec-tively for use twice daily on each half of the face were
distributed at the first visit.  At each control used vessels were collected in order to allow calculation of the amount of cream used. Tests were carried out in a half- face, double manner. The partic ipants rested for a 20-min acclimatizing period before th e measurements at a room temperature ranging between 19 ˚C - 21˚C and RH be-tween 40% and 60%. The subj ect was seated in a com-fortable armchair with closed eyes in order to relax. In this position measurements were done on the periocular skin surface. 2.2.1.4. Skin Surface Evaluation The surface of living skin wa s analyzed by the direct non-invasive method using the instrument Skin Visio-scan VC98 [16]. In Skin Vi sioscan technique the image of the skin is taken by a built in CCD-camera. The Sur-face Evaluation Living Skin (SELS) parameters Sew (wrinkles parameter), calculated from the average num-ber and width of horizontal and vertical wrinkles and Sesc (scaliness parameter), representative of the dryness
of stratum corneum, were ev aluated [16]. The ideal mois-
ber and width of horizontal and vertical wrinkles and Sesc (scaliness parameter), representative of the dryness of stratum corneum, were ev aluated [16]. The ideal mois-turizing or anti-aging treatme nt should decrease Sew and Sesc. 2.2.1.5. Skin Microtopography Skin Visiometer SV600FW (optical profilometry) is used for non-direct measurement of skin topography [17-22]. To obtain negative imprints of the examined skin area, fast hardened blue silicon and adhesive disks were used. The adhesive disk was layered onto the volunteer’s skin to delimit the investigated area, avoiding skin stretching during the application and ke eping track of the specimen orientation. A small amount of silicone was then spread into the internal circular ar ea delimited by the adhesive disk and left in situ for 15 minutes until dry. The disc was next removed obtaining a careful duplicate of the skin surface on the silicone. The silicon replica was put on a special frame and in-
serted in the special device where a light source sending out parallel light and a video sensor CCD on the other side. The replica reproduces the skin as a negative i.e. wrinkles are reproduced as mountains as the silicone is thicker in that place.

Efficacy and Tolerance Study of an Oligopeptide with Potential Anti-Aging Activity 135  (cR 3) was examined. cR 3 is the average roughness calcu-lated by circular arrangement of the lines in order to compensate the influence from  the direction of the wrin-kles [19]. The ideal moisturizing or anti-aging treatment should decrease cR 3. 2.2.1.6. Melanin Measurement Mexameter MX18 was used to estimate the activity of the oligopeptide on skin pigmentation [23,24]. 2.2.1.7. Self-Assessment Subjects were asked to provide an assessment of im-provement or not at the end of the treatment relative to baseline for fine lines, skin brightness and skin smooth-ness. These variables were sc ored on a scale of 1-4 indi-cating total (4), great (3), moderate (2), slight (1) and none (0). 2.2.1.8. Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) TEWL measurements [25,26] were included to determine if the oligopeptide-20 affects skin barrier. Tewameter
was used. In this instrument the water evaporation gra-dient, developed from the skin surface is measured by a probe that is placed perpendicularly on the skin site to be measured. The probe consists of an open cylinder con-taining two hygrosensors coupled with two thermistors placed at different distances from the skin surface. At both points, the relative humidity and temperature are measured and the corresponding vapour pressured is calculated. The difference between the vapour pressures at both points along the gradient is directly related to the rate of the evaporative water loss through the particular skin site. 2.2.1.9. Statistical Analysis The improvement regarding Sew, Sesc and cR 3 were cal-culated according to the equation [(ScoreDn – ScoreD0)/ Score D0] × 100, where n: 20, 40 and 60. The Wilcoxon signed rank tests were applied to study variations between measurements obtained the first and last day of the study and paired t tests between measure-
ments of the active and vehicle side at D20, D40 and D60. All the analyses were two-tailed. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, whereas p value < 0.1 was considered suggestive and p < 0.5 side preferred. The data was analyzed usin g the Statmost statistical package. 2.2.2. Safety Evaluation In order to evaluate the tolerability and the potential irritant power of the cream containing oligopeptide-20, 13 subjects both females and males, with an age between 18 - 70 years have been selected for the test, following the under mentioned inclusion criteria: 1) good state of general health; 2) no dermatopathies; 3) no pharmacol-ogical treatment in progress; 4) promise not to change usual daily routine; 5) no atopy. The test involves single application, 48 h semi-occluded patch test. The equip-ment used for the semi-occluded patch is composed of a small cavity of 0.64 cm2 with a filter tissue at the bottom
which is made to receive the product to test. All this is fixed to a hypoallergenic non woven adhesive tape. Treatment sites (back of the volunteers) are assessed be-fore the first application of 0.02 ml test material (baseline) and after treatment at 30 minutes after patch removal. Negative controls (empty patch) are used to facilitate evaluation. The quantification of the skin irritation is given through a numeric scale. The average irritant score of the product is calculated from the average of the quo-tations obtained for each volunteer, allowing ranking from “non irritant to very irritant”. The reactions were evaluated according the follow ing arbitrary scale [27,28]. Erythema No erythema: 0, Light erythema (hardly visible): 1, Clearly visible erythema: 2, Moderate erythema: 3, Seri-ous erythema (dark red with possible formation of light eschars): 4. Edema No edema: 0, Very light edema (hardly visible): 1, Light
edema: 2, Moderate edema (about 1 mm raised skin): 3, Strong edema (extended swelling even beyond the appli-cation area): 4.
Edema No edema: 0, Very light edema (hardly visible): 1, Light edema: 2, Moderate edema (about 1 mm raised skin): 3, Strong edema (extended swelling even beyond the appli-cation area): 4. The index of average irritation was classified accord-ing amended Draize system: Non irritating: 0.5, 0.5 - 2.0: slightly irritating, 2.0 - 5.0: moderately irritating, 5.0 - 8.0 (highly irritating). 3. Results and Discussion Of those recruited in the ant-aging evaluation, 20 of 22 subjects completed the 2 month treatment period. The results of 20 subjects were  analyzed. None abandoned the study for adverse events or serious side effects. The most common side effect reported was dryness ( Table 1 ). Dryness remained during the 2 month treatment and has to be mainly attributed to the poor synthesis of both creams in emollient ingredients, since the above symp-toms were recorded at almost equal ratios for both the active and vehicle cream. No irritant or allergic reactions
were documented during the test period. We used direct non-invasive Visioscan VC98 tech-nique [16] in order to evaluate skin surface. Regarding our study, Sew parameter indicative of number and width of horizontal and vertical wr inkles showed a decrease of 11.7% (p < 0.05) in the case of active side. The decrease for the vehicle side was remarkably lower (5.5%, p < 0.05) ( Figure 1 ).

We used  optical profilometry (negative skin replicas) in order to evaluate skin microtopography, as well [17- 22]. To date most of the non-invasive methods of quanti-
fication of cutaneous relief have consisted of the replicas. The relief profile is measured by optical techique. The metal industry has for several years defined and stan-dardized the parameters used for characterization of the surface area of the metals. These parameters are the ones used for profilometric analysis of cutaneous microrelief.  The major parameters cited in the literature for skin surface are R1, R2 and R3 [19]. The measuring of these parameters is of importance for the discussion of the ac-tual efficacy of the products on wrinkles and skin rough-ness, although clinical diversity and skin microrelief and wrinkles can hardly be reduced to the measurement of two or three parameters. As age increased, an increase of roughness parameters is observed [19]. In our study, a gradual improvement of cyclic rough-ness (cR 3) was observed during treatment for both sides. The cR 3 showed an overall decreas e of 12.2% in the case
of active side, whereas the decrease was almost the half (6.4%) for the vehicle side ( Figure 3 ). Regarding pigmentation, no identified influence on melanin content was recorded either in peptide- or vehi-cle-treated half face. In the self-assessment 85% of the subjects (17 of 20, p < 0.005) claimed that the active side showed different degrees of improvement in fine wrinkles with a median of 1.35 (slight to moderate) while 65% (13 of 20, p < 0.005) claimed the vehicle treated side had improved with a median of 0.75 (rather slight). 80% of the subjects (16 of 20, p < 0.005) reported slight improvement of skin brightness in active side, while 55% (11 of 20, p < 0.005)  Figure 1.

The results of self-assessment were in accordance with the data obtained by the bioen-gineering measurement. The recorded improvement of fine wrinkles by the 85% of the volunteers on the pep-tide-treated half correlates well with the decrease in wrinkles (Sew, D60, p < 0.05) and decrease in roughness (cR 3, D60, p < 0.005). Only the slight improvement in skin brightness recorded by 80% of the volunteers on the active side is not confirmed by the Mexameter measure-ments, since, the treatment did not reduce the extent and number of hyperpigmented spots on the face nor changed skin color as was measured by Mexameter. These sub-
ject-perceived benefits may be due to a “halo-effect” —subjects received a desired skin improvement on the peptide-treated side and translated that to a total improve   Figure 3.

Ther efore, the combination of self-assessment with the bioengineering methods seems necessary. Disturbances in biophysical properties of the skin dur-ing irritant reaction induced by exposure to cosmetic ingredients may be assessed by several non-invasive methods. The most popular one involves determinations of transepidermal water loss (TEWL), stratum corneum hydration, skin pH and evaluation of erythema and ede- ma and skin blood flow [29].

Although, the penetration an d localization of the lipo-some form of oligopeptide-20 has been captured by fluorescence microscope, the labeled peptide being ob-served in epidermis and dermis [10], cutaneous penetra-tion of pure oligopeptide will be in the future examined. At present we do not know which the ideal treatment period is. We think that a 4-month follow-up study would be useful in order to ensure the maximum improvement. The 0.003% w/w concentration of oligopeptide-20 in the cream used in the parent study is according to empirical data and is lower than maximum recommended (0.005% w/w, 500 ppm). In conclusion, the application of the tested cream with 0.003% w/w oligopeptide-20 improves several clinical characteristics relating to skin aging, without damage to
skin barrier or serious side ef fects. Furthermore, it is not irritating. The addition of moisturizing and emollient
