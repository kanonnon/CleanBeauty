To my wife, Gene for 50 years of hope,making every day meaningful for me. To myfather, an example for me and an inspirationto many. To my mother, who struggled withhealth problems throughout her long life butaccepted it with grace. To my daughterLaurie and her husband T.J. and little Grifﬁn;to my son, Mark; to my brother John andhis family and to my “little sister” Becky andto Ken and his family and to my many otherrelatives and friends who help to make lifemeaningful for me.I would like to dedicate this ﬁfth edition to ﬁvecolleagues and friends who have had a verypositive inﬂuence on my life and/or my careerin science. To John Wright, who initiatedmy interest in chemistry; to Bill Truce, whotaught me to work as an independentscientist; to George Scott, my mentor inkeratin ﬁber science; to Charles Reich,a colleague who kept me on my toesscientiﬁcally, but who unfortunately passedaway about a year ago and to Glenn King awonderful friend who passed away just a fewdays ago.
Preface to the Fifth EditionNearly 9 years have passed since the writing of the fourth edition and muchprogress has been made in that time span. Identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of thechromosomes and genes involved in the important IF (intermediate ﬁlament) andKAP (keratin associated proteins) proteins of human hair and some of the genesinvolved in different forms of alopecia and hair abnormalities has occurred. Manyof the SNPs of different genes in natural hair color and hair ﬁber size and shape andthe geographic inﬂuence on these genes and properties have also been made. Our
understanding of the distribution of different proteins in the ﬁber and its control ofhair ﬁber curvature has increased dramatically. Methods development has alsoincreased at a rapid pace. For example, a new hair curvature (most important singleﬁber property of hair) method has been described and applied to the scalp hairof more than 2,400 different persons in more than 20 different countries. Ourunderstanding of hair growth, hair breakage, the torsional behavior of hair andthe mechanisms of important oxidative reactions (chemical bleaching and sunlightdegradation) in human hair has also improved greatly.This edition contains expanded data and more comprehensive data bases withstatistical analyses for hair ﬁber diameters, hair densities (hairs/cm2), ellipticity,
2), ellipticity,incidence of hair graying, male pattern alopecia, female pattern alopecia versus age,and comparisons of most of these properties among different geo-ethnic groups andmales versus females. Sections on the effects of pregnancy and the menopause onhair ﬁber and assembly properties have also been expanded as well as a newChapter providing deﬁnition for most of the important cosmetic hair assemblyproperties and how these properties are inﬂuenced by changes in single ﬁberproperties in general and as a function of age.Clermont, USA Clarence R.

Chapter 1Morphological, Macromolecular Structureand Hair GrowthAbstract At or near its surface, hair ﬁbers contain a thick protective coverconsisting of six to eight layers of ﬂat overlapping scale-like structures calledcuticle or scales which consists of high sulfur KAPs, keratin proteins and structurallipids. The cuticle layers surround the cortex, but the cortex contains the major partof the ﬁber mass. The cortex consists of spindle-shaped cells that are alignedparallel with the ﬁber axis. Cortical cells consist of both Type I and Type II keratins(IF proteins) and KAP proteins. Coarser hairs often contain one or more looselypacked porous regions called the medulla, located near the center of the ﬁber. Thecell membrane complex, the “glue” that binds or holds all of the cells together, is ahighly laminar structure consisting of both structural lipid and protein structures.Hair ﬁbers grow in cycles consisting of three distinct stages called anagen
(growth), catagen (transition) and telogen (rest). Each stage is controlled by molec-ular signals/regulators acting ﬁrst on stem cells and then on the newly formed cellsin the bulb and subsequently higher up in differentiation in the growing ﬁber. Theeffects and incidence of hair growth and hair loss (normal and diseased) for bothmales and females are described in detail. Molecular structures controlling hairﬁber curvature (whether a ﬁber is straight or curly) and the effects of the differentstructural units of the ﬁber on stress–strain and swelling behavior are described indetail.1.1 Introduction
1.1 IntroductionSince writing the fourth edition, several signiﬁcant ﬁndings have occurred regard-ing the morphology, the growth and development, and the structure of human scalphair ﬁbers. Our knowledge of hair growth, development and formation both at thecellular and the molecular levels has continued to increase at a rapid rate and ourunderstanding of the origin of ﬁber curvature has increased considerably. Forexample, recent evidence demonstrates more of a bilateral type structure inhuman hair ﬁbers as curvature increases providing different types of corticalC.R.

structures on the inside of a curl vs. the outside, analogous to wool ﬁber. Additionaldetails of the surface structure, that is the epicuticle and the cuticle cell membraneshave been uncovered providing a better understanding of the surface of hair ﬁbersand the organization and makeup of the three cell membrane complexes that bindsall of the hair cells together. Signiﬁcant ﬁndings regarding the lipid composition ofhair, its importance to barrier functions, to the isoelectric point and its potential forstress strain involvement have been added.Important additions to the sections on male and female pattern alopecia havebeen made including incidence vs. age and affected regions of the scalp. Additionalinformation on hair diameter and hair density (hairs/cm2) changes with age, hairdensity in different regions of the scalp and variation by geo-racial group (linkinggeographic origin and its effects on genetics with race). The effects of pregnancy on
scalp hair are also described in greater detail than in prior editions.Human hair is a keratin-containing appendage that grows from large cavities orsacs called follicles. Hair follicles extend from the surface of the skin through thestratum corneum and the epidermis into the dermis, see Fig. 1.1. Hair providesprotective, sensory and sexual attractiveness functions. Hair is characteristic of allFig. 1.1 A section of humanskin illustrating a hair ﬁber inits follicle as it emergesthrough the skin and how it isnourished2 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
mammals and in humans grows over a large percentage of the body surface.Regardless of the species of origin or body site, human hair grows in three distinctstages and has certain common structural characteristics. These three cyclicalstages of hair ﬁbers are called anagen (growing stage), catagen (transition stage)and telogen (resting stage), see Fig. 1.2.Morphologically, a fully formed hair ﬁber contains three and sometimes fourdifferent units or structures. At or near its surface, hair contains a thick protectivecovering consisting of one or more layers of ﬂat overlapping scale-like structurescalled cuticle or scales see Fig. 1.3. The cuticle layers surround the cortex, but theFig. 1.2 Schematic illustrating the three stages of growth of human hair ﬁbersFig. 1.3 Schematic diagramof a cross section of a humanhair ﬁber1.1 Introduction 3
cortex contains the major part of the ﬁber mass. The cortex consists of spindle-shaped cells that are aligned parallel with the ﬁber axis. Cortical cells contain manyof the ﬁbrous proteins of hair. Coarser hairs often contain one or more looselypacked porous regions called the medulla, located near the center of the ﬁber. Thefourth important unit of structure is the cell membrane complex the “glue” thatbinds or holds all of the cells together.These structures with the exception of the medulla are in all animal hairs, themedulla only in coarser hairs. Figure 1.4contains scanning electron micrographs(SEMs) of four mammalian species taken at different magniﬁcations. Thesemicrographs demonstrate the cuticle structure of a cat whisker, a wool ﬁber, ahuman hair, and a horsetail hair. The cross-sections of the horsetail hair reveal thecortex and the multiple porous channels or regions of the medulla characteristic of
coarse hairs, but generally absent from ﬁne animal hairs such as ﬁne wool ﬁber.Although this book is concerned with hair ﬁbers in general, the primary focus ison human scalp hair and this chapter is concerned mainly with the morphology, themacromolecular structure and the growth of this unique natural ﬁber.Fig. 1.4 Hair ﬁbers from different mammalian species. Upper left is an SEM of a cat whisker(1510 X). Upper right is an SEM of a human hair ﬁber (1000 X). Lower left is an SEM of a woolﬁber (2000 X). Lower right is an SEM of sections of horse tail ﬁber (400 X)4 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
1.2 General Structure and GrowthThe schematic diagram of Fig. 1.5illustrates an active growing human hair ﬁberinside the follicle, which is the sac that originates in the subcutaneous tissue of theskin and contains the hair ﬁber with several surrounding structures involved in itsgrowth. The dermal papilla, located near the center of the bulb is involved inimportant growth functions during anagen (Fig. 1.2). The basal layer that produceshair cells nearly surrounds the bulb. Melanocytes that produce hair pigment alsoexist within the bulb close to the dermal papilla. Blood vessels (Fig. 1.1) carrynourishment to the growing hair ﬁber deep within the skin at the base of the bulb.Figure 1.6illustrates other important active layers of the growing ﬁber in thefollicle.The human hair ﬁber beneath the skin can be divided into several distinct zonesalong its axis (Fig. 1.5). The zone of biological synthesis and orientation resides at
and around the bulb. This zone is sometimes divided into a lower region called cellproliferation or cell matrix. Moving upward in the growing ﬁber is the region of celldifferentiation which leads into the zone of keratinization, where stability is builtinto the hair structure by the formation of cystine linkages [ 1]. The next zone thatbegins below the skin line and eventually emerges through the skin surface is theregion of the permanent hair ﬁber. The permanent hair ﬁber consists of fully formeddehydrated corniﬁed cuticle, cortical and sometimes medullary cells, but always thecell membrane complex which acts like a natural adhesive, binding the hair cellstogether.Fig. 1.5 Pilosebaceous unit with a hair ﬁber in its follicle and the zones of protein and cellsynthesis, differentiation, keratinization and the region of the permanent hair ﬁber as the ﬁberemerges through the scalp1.2 General Structure and Growth 5
The major emphasis in this book is on the chemistry, structure, and physics ofthe permanent zone of the human hair ﬁber and as indicated; the primary focus is onhuman scalp hair as opposed to hair of other parts of the body.Randebrock [ 2] suggested that the diameter of human scalp hair ﬁbers variesfrom 40 to 120 mm. Others provide a somewhat larger range varying from about 20to 125 mm. The low values for this latter estimate are undoubtedly due to theinclusion of hair of infants and young children. For adult hair we estimate thevariation from means of subjects to be primarily between 45 and 110 mm. The rangefor individual hairs on individual scalps can exceed these values. Figure 1.7illustrates the range in ﬁber diameters and cross-sectional shapes of hairs fromﬁve Caucasian adults. For a more complete discussion of hair ﬁber diameter see thenext section and also Chap. 9and the review by Bogaty [ 3] and the referencestherein.Outer root sheathHenle layerHuxley layer

1.2.1 Variation in Fiber Diameter on Different Partsof the HeadMost of the work in the scientiﬁc literature is on scalp hair from the vertex or thecrown area, although hair from other regions of the scalp is sometimes used. Garn[4] citing others and his own work stated that scalp hair is ﬁnest at the temples andmost coarse at the sideburns on “normal” scalps. “Normal” scalp usually meanspre-alopecia or before the phenomenon of balding begins. The lower sideburns areactually beard hair which is coarser than scalp hair. Tolgyesi et al. [ 5] demonstratedthat beard hair contains a higher amount or higher percentage of hairs with medulla.Beard hair is also more elliptical and it has more irregular cross-sectional shapesand lower disulﬁde content (cross-link density) than human scalp hair [ 5].As indicated, for adults, the mean diameter (from the vertex or crown areas ofthe scalp) usually ranges from about 45 to about 110 mm and the diameter shows
large differences among neighboring hairs on the same head, ranging from a factorof less than 1.4 to more than 2.0 on adult Caucasian women [ 6]. Garn is essentiallyin agreement with Yin et al. [ 6] on these ranges on an individual scalp, claiming asearly as 1948 that on the same scalp neighboring hairs may vary by more than afactor of 2. Hair on different regions of the scalp grows at different rates. DeBerkeret al. [ 7] determined that on “normal” scalps, hair grows slowest on the temples(0.39 mm/Day males) and faster on the vertex (0.44 mm/Day males) where it growscoarser. Additional data on growth rates is described later in this chapter.Three distinct regions (cuticle, cortex and medulla) containing different types ofcells are generally apparent in cross sections of fully formed human hair ﬁbers frommost parts of the body (see Figs. 1.3,1.7and1.8). After brief discussions on thefunctions of hair, hair growth/hair loss and treatments for hair loss, the remainder of
this chapter focuses on the structures of these three types of cells and the intercel-lular binding material (cell membrane complex) of human scalp hair.Fig. 1.8 Treated hair ﬁbers cross sectioned with a microtime.

1.2.2 Functions of Hair on Different Parts of the BodyHuman scalp hair provides both protective and cosmetic or adornment functions.Scalp hair protects the head from the elements by functioning as a thermal insulator.Hair also protects the scalp against sunburn, other effects of light radiation andmechanical abrasion. Hair on parts of the body other than the scalp provides relatedprotective and adornment functions. The adornment function of eyebrows is to thebeholder. However, eyebrows also inhibit sweat and prevent extraneous matterfrom running into the eyes. In addition, eyebrows protect the bony ridges above theeyes, and assist in communication and in the expression of emotion.Eyelashes are also important to adornment. Eyelashes protect the eyes from
sunlight and foreign objects, and they assist in communication. Nasal hairs ﬁlterinspired air and retard the ﬂow of air into the respiratory system, thus allowing air tobe warmed or cooled as it enters the body. Hair on other parts of the anatomy servesrelated functions. A general function of all hairs is as sensory receptors, because allhairs are supplied with sensory nerve endings. The sensory receptor function canenhance hair in its protective actions.1.3 Hair GrowthThis discussion on hair growth is considered in two parts:Follicular/hair apparatus development in the fetus andHair follicle cycling or the growth of hairs in the follicle before and after birth1.3.1 Development of the Follicular/Hair Apparatus with itsEssential StructuresFollicular/hair apparatus development in the fetus determines the number and
distribution of follicles with their growth structures and the ultimate size of hairﬁbers thereafter. It includes the length that hair ﬁbers can grow to on all differentparts of the body at different stages of life such as the relatively long hairs of thescalp with their long anagen period and the relatively short hairs of the eyebrowswith their short anagen. The mesoderm directs the ectodermal cells on how torespond via molecular signals that interact with receptor sites for the normalformation of hair follicles and their contents [ 8–10]. Several different molecularspecies have been implicated in the process of hair follicle formation including,Wnt proteins [ 10–12], noggin [ 11,12], lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF-1)[10,13], sonic hedgehog (shh) [ 9,12,14], beta-catenin [ 13,15] and bone morpho-genic protein (BMP) [ 12]. A helpful and concise review describing details of8 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
this information is by Alonso and Fuchs [ 12]. In 2003, Fuchs and coworkers [ 11]demonstrated that two molecular signals, Wnt proteins and noggin together caninﬂuence immature stem cells to form hair follicles and their internal components.What is so fascinating is that these same stem cells can form either hair follicles orepidermis, but with Wnt protein and noggin signals originating from different partsof the skin and working together, these stem cells produce an activated transcriptionfactor and ultimately hair follicles with their essential structures.According to Fuchs, this process is multi-step along these lines:– Wnt protein stabilizes B-catenin increasing its concentration in stem cells– Noggin inhibits BMP leading to LEF-1 production– B-Catenin activates LEF-1 (which controls gene activity)– LEF-1 down-regulates a Gene for the protein E-Cadherin– Lower levels of E-Cadherin reduce cell adhesion structures and initiates forma-tion of
tion of– Epithelial Buds for follicle formationToo much E-cadherin (triggers cell adhesion ingredients) can interfere with thedownward growth of the stem cells to form a hair follicle. However, with theoptimal amount of E-cadherin the stem cells are loosened to the most favorableextent allowing them to grow downward to form a hair follicle with its differentcellular structures. At the time of birth approximately ﬁve million hair follicles willhave been formed over the entire human body, but no additional hair follicles areformed after birth [ 13]. Research on some of the genes involved in hair loss isdescribed in Chap. 3.1.3.2 Hair Follicle Cycling and Hair GrowthGenerally around the ﬁfth fetal month, the follicles and their growth machineryhave been developed, although not entirely mature. Each individual hair after birthis programmed to grow in cycles involving three distinct stages (see Fig. 1.2). These
growth stages of the hair ﬁber are partly controlled by chemical messengersincluding Wnt proteins (Wnt) [ 8,14,16,17] and Sonic hedgehog (shh) [ 9,16,18] that stimulate stem cells in the bulge and induce new anagen. Factors that areknown to maintain anagen are SGK3 [ 12,19] and Msx2 [ 12,20]. Androgens(hormones produced by the adrenals and the sex glands stimulate the activity ofmale sex glands and male characteristics) also play a role in hair development. Asindicated in the introduction, the three stages of growth are called anagen, catagenand telogen:1. The anagen stage, or the actual growing stage, is characterized by intensemetabolic activity in the hair bulb. For scalp hair, this activity generally lasts2–6 years producing hairs that grow to approximately 100 cm in length (~3 ft);1.3 Hair Growth 9
however, human scalp hair longer than 150 cm (~5 ft) is frequently observed inlong hair contests (see Fig. 1.9), indicative of a longer anagen period.Terminal (children or adult) hair does grow at slightly different rates on differentregions of the scalp. For example, hair grows at approximately 14-cm/year(~5.5 in./year) on the vertex or the crown area of the scalp of Caucasian femalesadults; at a slightly slower rate (~13 cm/year) in the temples and generally ateven slower rates on other body regions (e.g., ~10 cm/year) in the beard area.2. The catagen stage or the transition stage lasts for only a few weeks. Duringcatagen, metabolic activity slows down, and the base of the bulb migratesupward in the skin toward the epidermal surface. Molecular regulators thatpromote the transition from anagen to catagen are: Growth factors (FGF5 andEGF1) and neurotrophins (BDNF, p53, TGF b1 and BMPRIa) [ 12].Fig. 1.9 “Three women,” by Belle Johnson. Taken about 1900. Hair generally grows to a
maximum length of about 3 ft; however, specimens over 5 ft in length have been documented(Reprinted with permission of the Massillon Museum, Massillon, Ohio)10 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
3. Telogen or the resting stage also lasts only a few weeks (generally 4–8). At thisstage, growth has stopped completely and the base of the bulb has atrophied tothe point at which it approaches the level of the sebaceous canal.At the onset of a new growth cycle, a new hair begins to grow beneath thetelogen follicle, pushing the old telogen ﬁber out. The telogen ﬁber is eventuallyshed. Sometimes a latency period or a lag time occurs between hair shedding andthe subsequent anagen period. This lag time has been called the “hair eclipsephenomenon” [ 9]. St. Jacques et al. [ 9] attributed this lag time to a dysfunction
involving early shedding and delayed anagen initiation or stunted hair growthbetween the two anagen phases. The hair eclipse may occur in telogen efﬂuvium(abnormal shedding) associated with new alopecia, post-partum alopecia, seasonalalopecia, alopecia areata or even shedding associated with seborrheic dermatitis ordandruff. St. Jacques et al. [ 9] suggested that local growth factors or other mediatorsthat are either missing or deﬁcient may be involved in this condition. The effects ofantidandruff agents on abnormal shedding are described in Chap. 6in the section ondandruff.Kishimoto et al. [ 17] demonstrated that at the beginning of each growth cycle ornew anagen period one or two stem cells that originate in the bulge (Fig. 1.5) areinduced by chemical messengers to produce or re-grow the lower portion of thefollicle (down to the zone of protein and cell synthesis Fig. 1.5) that ultimately
produces hair cells leading to a new hair ﬁber. Among the more important of thesemolecular signals or factors essential to follicle induction for hair cycling are Wntproteins (Wnt) [ 8,10,17] and Sonic hedgehog (shh) [ 9,14,16,18]. Kishimoto et al.[17] determined that Wnt signaling is essential for maintaining the hair inductiveactivity of the dermal papilla. Signaling by Wnts and shh is essential for newanagen and these regulators somehow act to initiate formation of the growth regionof hair follicles and the production of cells that have the potential to form hairﬁbers. The cells continue to divide in the matrix of the bulb (zone of protein and cellsynthesis) with virtually no differentiation until molecular signals initiate move-ment upward in the follicle and then differentiation begins in the zone of differen-tiation see Fig. 1.5. Zhu et al. [ 21] reported that the concentration of B1-integrinappears to control whether a cell moves upward to differentiate (lower concentra-
tion) or continues to divide in the matrix of the bulb. Lin et al. [ 22] identiﬁed notchproteins in differentiating cuticle and cortical cells and suggested these proteins arealso involved in differentiation.The newly formed hair cells near the base of the bulb at the dermal papilla (cellmatrix) move upward into the zone of differentiation and the melanocytes in thatsame region produce the hair pigment or pigments that are incorporated into eachgrowing hair ﬁber. This pigment is incorporated into the cortical and medullarycells of scalp hair by a phagocytosis mechanism as suggested by Piper [ 23].Kulessa et al. [ 24] found that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP’s) functionin differentiation. This fact has been demonstrated by inhibition of BMP’swith Noggin which produces an absence of acidic hair keratins (IF proteins) incuticle and cortical cells and an absence of tricohyalin protein in the medulla.1.3 Hair Growth 11
The expression of several transcription regulators of differentiation (Hocx13,Foxn1, Msx1 and Msx 2) are also reduced to low levels.Lef1 (lymphocyte enhancement factor) is activated in the initial cortex and is afactor that directly controls the transcription of hair shaft genes in protein produc-tion [ 24,25]. This activity of Lef1 in hair cycling suggest that Lef1 and BMP’scooperate in hair shaft differentiation and contrasts with the antagonistic action ofthese two regulators during early follicle development in the embryo as shown byDasGupta and Fuchs [ 25].Among the ﬁrst proteins formed in differentiating cortical cells are the interme-diate ﬁlament proteins. A single Type 1 (acidic) and a Type II (basic-neutral)intermediate ﬁlament protein combine to form helical dimers. These low sulfurdimers aggregate and two dimers combine to form tetramers. The tetramers interact
and become connected longitudinally to form sub-ﬁlaments sometimes calledprotoﬁlaments important subunits of the cortex. Human hair has at least 9 Type Iand 6 Type II intermediate ﬁlament proteins see the section in this Chapter entitledThe Cortex . Rogers [ 26] described that after the intermediate ﬁlament proteins, theglycine-tyrosine rich proteins, the KAP’s (Keratin Associated Proteins) 6, 7 and8 and ﬁnally the sulfur rich proteins are formed. Rogers also suggested that theKAP’s 1 and 5 are among the last cortical cell proteins to be expressed.The cortex forms before the cuticle with the helical dimers forming andaggregating and combining as described to initiate formation of the intermediateﬁlaments. The types and relative amounts of the intermediate ﬁlament proteins(IF’s) to KAP’s help determine the type of cortex that forms, such as orthocortex,mesocortex or paracortex see The Origin of Hair Fiber Curvature in this chapter.
The cuticle forms higher up in the follicle and its cystine rich proteins are largelyfrom the KAP5 and KAP10 families [ 26]. The site and synthesis of 18-methyleicosanoic acid of the cuticle cell membrane complex is not known, but is believedto be very high up in the follicle during the latter stages of synthesis anddifferentiation.After formation of cortical and cuticle cells, the cells remain bound by desmo-somes, tight junctions and gap junctions. These will ultimately be replaced by cellmembrane complex. During protein synthesis, hair proteins are kept in a reduced statewith virtually no disulﬁde cross-links. During the ﬁnal stages, the cells move upwardinto the zone of keratinization (Fig. 1.5) where disulﬁde and iso-peptide cross-links areformed and dehydration occurs. Disulﬁde bonds form through a mild oxidative processover a length of several hundred micrometers, and ultimately the permanent hair ﬁber
is completed. Rogers [ 26] suggested that the keratinization zone is about 1,000 mmlong (about ten times the diameter of a coarse human scalp hair ﬁber). The hair cellsmust be nearly completely ﬁlled with proteins as they are cross linked in about 48 h asthey pass through the zone of keratinization [ 26].The maturation process (over an individual’s life span) for scalp hairs in humansis controlled by androgens and other chemical messengers. Prenatal hairs usuallyoriginate in the third or fourth month of fetal life. In humans, prenatal hairsoriginate from the malpighian layer or the stratum germinativum of the epidermis.Prenatal hairs are sometimes called lanugo and are either lightly pigmented or12 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
contain no pigment. Prenatal or infant hair generally grows to a limit of about 15 cmsee Table 1.1. It is very ﬁne and by about 6–7 months after birth is replaced byslightly coarser hair, see Chap. 9for details. Children’s hair or primary terminal hair(pre-pubertal hair), is longer and coarser and generally grows to a length of about60 cm. Primary terminal hair of children generally begins at about 2–3 years of age.Soon after the onset of puberty, with its hormonal changes, hair ﬁbers growlonger and coarser; producing what is called secondary terminal hair. In addition tothese changes in scalp hair, hair in the axillaries, pubic, and beard areas (for males)becomes longer and coarser at the onset of puberty. Figure 1.10 shows that themaximum diameter of scalp hair for females peaks at a later age than for males (seeChap. 9for details). The data of Table 1.1shows that the time-span for anagen isshortest for infants, longer for children and longest from puberty to young adult-
hood. The data of this table also shows that the maximum attainable length anddiameter for human scalp hair also correlate positively.Table 1.1 Approximate human scalp hair length, diameter and anagen vs. age for femalecaucasiansApproximate ApproximateHair type Max. length (cm) Diameter ( mm) Est. anagen (Year)Infant ~15 30 (N ¼26)a~0.5Children (0.9) ~60 62 (N ¼82)b~4 yearAdult (15.29) ~100 74 (N ¼98)b~6 yearAdult (30.89) – 70 (N ¼75)b~5 yearVellus ~0.1 ~4 –aPecoraro V et al. [ 28], 26 full-term infants; hairs taken within 76 h of birth (13 males and 13females). The average diameter of dark complexioned newborns was 37 mm while the averagediameter for light colored hairs from light complexioned newborns was 22 mmbCalculated from Bogaty [ 3] and from Trotter and Dawson [ 27]Fig. 1.10 Hair ﬁber diameter vs. age for males and females (see Chapter 2, section 2.3 “Aginginﬂuences on Hair” and Chapter 9 for details and references)1.3 Hair Growth 13
As one’s age approaches maximum scalp diameter, hormonal changes induceslow gradual shortening of anagen for scalp hair of males. This action causes hairﬁbers to grow shorter and ﬁner. Ultimately, in many persons this effect results in thetransition of terminal hairs to vellus hairs, producing the condition commonlycalled baldness. Vellus hairs (Table 1.2) grow on those “hairless” regions of thebody including the bald scalp, the nose, and many other areas of the body thatappear hairless. Vellus hairs do not grow on the palms of the hands, the soles of thefeet, the undersurface of the ﬁngers and toes, the margin of the lips, the areolae ofthe nipples, the umbilicus, and the immediate vicinity of the urogenital and analopenings, the nail regions, and scar tissue.The phrase, terminal hairs, is normally applied to those long thick hairs that
occur during the latter stages of childhood and in adults. Terminal hairs, at somestage of development, grow on the scalp, eyelash area, eyebrow area, axillary andpubic areas, trunk and limbs of males and females, and the beard and mustacheareas of males.1.3.3 Extra Long HairAs indicated, scalp hair at maturity normally grows to a length of about 3 ft(~90 cm); however, in long hair contests, lengths greater than 5 ft (~150 cm), seeFig.1.9, are frequently observed and hair of several Guinness record holders havebeen measured at much longer lengths. Scalp hair length estimates by anatomicalsite, were made in Florida theme parks on 24,300 “adults” [ 29]. These hair length
estimates by anatomical site were related to anatomical measurements to obtainestimates of free hanging hair lengths in centimeters. A plot of the natural logarithmof the percent population vs. these hair lengths provides a straight line and anequation that with several assumptions permits the estimation of the numbers ofpersons in the USA and the world with hair lengths up to 183 cm (just beyond anklelength) [ 30].Data were also collected via a literature search for even longer hair lengths(ankle length or longer) to provide an equation to estimate the minimum numbers ofTable 1.2 Differences between primary-terminal and vellus hairsPrimary-terminal hairs Vellus hairsLong hairs (~1.0 m or longer) Short hairs (~1 mm)Thick hairs (30–120 mm diameter) Thin hairs (4 mm or less)Generally (not always) one hair perperpilosebaceous unitMore than one hair pilosebaceous unitUsually pigmented Non-pigmented

persons with exceptionally long hair [ 30]. Estimates of hair length from thesestudies are listed in Table 1.3.In March of 1988, Dianne Witt of Massachusetts had the longest scalp hair onrecord (Guinness Book of Records). Her hair was measured at more than 10 ft longor more than 300 cm. Four years later it was measured at 12 ft (~366 cm) in length,so Ms Witt’s hair appeared to be growing at a normal rate of about 6 in. per year(~15 cm). From this estimate of the growth rate at 15 cm/year and actual length, herhair has remained in anagen phase for more than 20 years, (see the section entitled,A mechanism for hair growth/hair loss and changes in hair size ). So, it wouldappear that hair that grows to longer than normal lengths does not grow at anexcessively fast rate; however it grows for longer time periods (longer anagenphase) than normal length hair.1.3.4 Excessive Hair Growth
1.3.4 Excessive Hair GrowthHypertrichosis is a condition in which an excessive growth of terminal hair occursusually on the limbs, trunk or face. Hypertrichosis may be localized or diffuse. Themost common type is called essential hirsutism or idiopathic hypertrichosis ofwomen. In this condition, terminal hairs grow on women in those areas wherehairiness is considered a secondary sex characteristic of males, such as the trunk,the limbs, or the beard or mustache areas. This condition is generally not due to anendocrine abnormality, but is believed to be linked to the transport of testosteronefrom the endocrine glands to the site of activity (see Fig. 1.11).Endocrinopathic hirsutism is a rare condition from excessive synthesis ofhormones with androgenic properties. This abnormality produces masculinization
of females. One symptom of this condition is excessive growth of terminal hairs inregions that are normally “hairless” in females. Classic examples of this disease areoftentimes exhibited in circus sideshows.Table 1.3 Estimates of hair length in USA and global populations% population (site) Approximate Approximate number of personsHair length (cm) Calculated from equations A and Ba12.04 (Shoulder) 35.5 26.6 million in USA1.88 (Shoulder blade) 55 4.2 million in USA0.281 (Waist) 75 620,000 in USA1.78/C210/C02(Buttocks) 104 39,300 in USA8.45/C210/C04(Knees) 136 1,900 in USA3.3/C210/C05(Ankles) 170 73 in USA; 1,500 in worldaNumbers rounded off, except where fewer than 100bPopulation of USA ¼270 million, but since approximately 82% of the USA population are age12 and above use 221 million as the adult population for the USA and since approximately 75% ofthe world’s population are 12 and above use 4.5 billion as the adult population for the world1.3 Hair Growth 15
1.4 Hair Loss (Alopecia)Hair loss actually involves the transition of terminal hairs to vellus hairs. Thiscondition occurs gradually and at different rates for different persons. This sectioncontains general information on hair loss both for men and women. Immediatelyfollowing this section are detailed sections on male pattern alopecia and femalepattern alopecia. Details and references on the chromosomes and genes involved inthese alopecias are described in Chap. 3in the section entitled Some Other HairTraits related to Genetics .The phenomenon of androgenetic alopecia tends to occur in a more diffusepattern among women than men. The term “male pattern baldness” is used for thepatterns of balding for men that either begin in the crown of the scalp and moveforward or begin in the frontal area of the scalp and recede to create characteristicpatterns (Fig. 1.12) which occurs in only a small percentage of women [ 6] as shownby Venning and Dawber [ 6].
by Venning and Dawber [ 6].1.4.1 Hair Density or the Number of Hairs/Unit AreaBarman et al. [ 31] suggested variation in scalp hair density (hairs/cm2) between 150and 300 among normal Caucasians, but current evidence shows this variation ismore likely from about 75 to 450 terminal hairs/cm2. Hair counts on normal scalpsgenerally show less than 10% telogen hairs [ 32–34]. The considerable variation inhair counts occurs from the following variables: geo-racial group, age, method,scalp region and scalp conditions such as male and female pattern alopecia (later inthis chapter) and the menopause (Chap. 2).The hair density study summarized in Table 1.4was carried out by Loussouarnet al. [ 35] on males and females from three different countries with more than 500Fig. 1.11 Schematic illustrating how androgens combine with a protein receptor to form an activespecies that can either stimulate or inhibit hair growth16 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
subjects between 1999 and 2003. The Asian subjects were Chinese recruited fromBeijing (north China), Shanghai (Central China) and Guangzhou (South China).The Caucasians were from Paris or its suburbs and 98 Africans, living either inJohannesburg, South Africa plus 118 volunteers living in France, but native to Westor Central Africa. To address a concern of the few Caucasian women in this study(51), I took hair density data from the parietal region of the scalp kindly provided byDr Andrew Messenger (for “normal” Caucasian females who came to dermatologyclinics with no concerns about hair loss) and analyzed the data for 102 subjects ofage 18–35. Distribution analysis provided a normal distribution with a mean hairdensity of 290 /C646 which is reasonably close to the hair density value byLoussouarn et al. for 51 female Caucasians of 308 /C668 between the ages of 18
and 35 and provided reassurance to the data by Loussouarn et al. It also suggestedthat hair density of the vertex is similar to the parietal region.Fig. 1.12 Schematicillustrating different classesand types of male patternalopecia. Various schemeshave been described forclassiﬁcation of male patternalopecia. This one wasadapted from one ofHamilton’sTable 1.4 Comparative hair densities (hairs/cm2) of different geo-racial groups (panelists 18–35years of Age) [ 35]Hair density in terms of the number of hairs/cm2aAfrican (S.

aValues are mean plus or minus standard deviations. Data shows a signiﬁcant area effect but nosigniﬁcant difference between sexes. Both Asian and African groups provided signiﬁcantly lowerhair densities than for Caucasians1.4 Hair Loss (Alopecia) 17
This study by Loussouarn et al., with Chinese East Asians, Africans andCaucasians, is consistent with other studies showing that the hair density ofAfricans [ 32–34] and of Asians [ 36] is lower than that of Caucasians. Furthermore,from the data of Table 1.4the hair density of Asians (vertex and occipital sites)appears to be slightly higher than that of Africans. The data of Table 1.4suggeststhat the hair density of Chinese females ages 18–35 is about 25% lower in all threeregions of the scalp than that of Caucasian females of the same age.Loussouarn et al. also analyzed the hair density of males of these same geo-racialgroups, see Table 1.4. The hair density of males by geo-racial group shows the samerank order as for females in all three scalp regions. Furthermore, the hair density inthe vertex and occipital regions of males (ages 18–35) is signiﬁcantly lower(matched pairs test) in all three geo-racial groups than for females of the same
group. Loussouarn et al. explain this effect by “a difference which may be partiallyexplained by the high prevalence of male androgenetic alopecia in this group”.These data (Table 1.4) also suggest approximately 81,000–121,000 hairs on thescalp (about 242 hairs/cm2times 500 cm2scalp area for female Caucasians ¼121,000 scalp hairs; 178 /C2500¼89,000 scalp hairs for Asian females; and163/C2500¼81,500 scalp hairs for African females). It is frequently stated thathumans lose about 100 hairs/day. For Caucasians assuming 121,000 hairs on the scalpand 7% of the hairs are in telogen phase which lasts about 90 days/year calculates to
an average daily fall out of about 94 hairs. For Africans this would be about 63 hairsand for Asians about 69 hairs assuming hair counts as indicated by the data ofLoussourarn et al. for females from ages 18 to 35 and the same percentage fall outfor each of these three groups. This rate of hair shedding or fall out actually calculatesto an average anagen period of about 3.5 years and we normally say it is about 2–6years. So it is fair to say that adult female Caucasians ages 18–35 lose about 100 (94)hairs/day, Asians about 70 (69) and Africans about 60 (63) hairs/day.Shedding rates, however, vary to a small degree seasonally and they normallydecrease during and increase after pregnancy. Shedding rates also increase with agesometime in adulthood for females (in the mid to late twenties) and sooner formales (as shown later in this chapter). Lynﬁeld [ 37] determined that the proportion
of follicles in anagen increases during pregnancy. Additional details on the effectsof pregnancy are described later in this chapter.With regard to the seasonal effect, in a normal scalp the proportion of follicles inanagen peaks to nearly 90% in the spring (March in the Northern Hemisphere) intemperate climates and falls steadily to a low of about 80% in the late fall(November in the Northern Hemisphere) when the telogen count is highest asindicated by Randall and Ebling [ 38]. This effect is accompanied by increasinghair fall-out in the fall. As baldness approaches, the anagen time period decreases,thus the percentage of hairs in anagen (normally 80–90 plus percent) decrease asshown by Courtois et al. [ 39,40]. The remainder of hairs is in catagen and telogen.Anagen/telogen ratios are sometimes used as a criterion of the balding condition,that is, as balding progresses the ratio of anagen hairs to telogen hairs decreases.
These ratios may be determined by plucking hairs and microscopically evaluatingthe roots (Figs. 1.13 and1.14) or even better by the phototrichogram method18 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
(Fig. 1.15) in which a small area of the scalp is shaved, photographed and re-photographed 3–5 days later. Comparison of the two photos reveals those hairs thathave grown (anagen hairs, Fig. 1.13) and those hairs that have not grown (telogenhairs, Fig. 1.14) providing a determination of anagen/telogen ratios.Fig. 1.13 A light micrographof plucked hair ﬁbers in theanagen stageFig. 1.14 A light micrographof a plucked hair ﬁber in thetelogen stageFig. 1.15 Enlargedphotographs of the scalp, Left:Immediately after shaving.Right : Three days aftershaving.

For additional details on hair density including hair density changes with age seethe next sections on alopecia entitled Male Pattern Baldness andHair Loss AmongWomen.1.4.2 Male Pattern BaldnessMale pattern baldness or male pattern alopecia (MPA) is different from femalepattern baldness in several ways such as in pattern (compare Fig. 1.12 withFig. 1.16), incidence (70% of males vs. about 30% of females) and initial age(teens to early 20s for Caucasian males and the late 20s for Caucasian women (datasuggests early to mid 20s). Norwood [ 41] described the incidence of MPA in 1,000Caucasian males from ages 18 through the late 80s. He classiﬁed these males by theHamilton-Norwood system a similar but more elaborate scheme than that depictedin Fig. 1.12. The data of Table 1.5summarizes my analyses of these data.Extrapolation of the data from the equation for Types III through VII (seeTable 1.5 for deﬁnitions) suggests that Type III MPA begins in some
Caucasian males as early as about age 16. The equation for Types III–VII incidenceis Y¼/C08.986 + 0.8689X. 0.01625(X /C054.5)2where Y ¼predicted incidence andX¼age. I chose the linear over the quadratic model for types V–VII where:Y¼/C010.09 + 0.5679X (Y ¼predicted incidence of types V–VII and X ¼age)because it was favored by p value and root mean square error. Averaging theextrapolations from the two different models suggests that type V MPA (seeTable 1.5) begins in some persons as early as age 19 or 20.The incidence of MPA Type III has been shown to be lower in both Korean(~14% in a study with 5,531 Korean men) [ 42] and Chinese men (~20% in a studywith 3,519 Chinese men) [ 43] than in Caucasian men (~70%) [ 36], in agreementwith the ﬁndings of Hamilton [ 44]. See Table 1.6for additional comparisons atdifferent ages.Fig. 1.16 Schematic illustrating Ludgwig’s different types of female pattern alopecia20 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
Clearly MPA begins at an earlier age in Caucasian males than in Koreans orChinese. Table 1.6shows an average of the Korean plus Chinese data as anapproximation for Asian men. Interestingly, only the last point at the highest ageshowed a large difference in these two Asian groups.

300 Caucasian and 300 Black males at a hospital setting in Washington D.C. andindicated they were chosen randomly. Setty found a lower incidence of baldingamong Blacks vs. Caucasians.1.4.2.1 Scalp Hair Density and MPA Versus AgeAmong the many useful studies of scalp hair density in MPA was the one byCourtois et al. [ 40] who studied aging effects on hair cycles, including hair densityand lengths of anagen along with an estimate of ﬁber diameters during an 8–14 yearperiod on the same men (beginning at 25–32 years of age). These panelists aredescribed in more detail in Table 1.7, along with hair densities measured by thephototrichogram method at the beginning and end of the program.All three groups of subjects showed a reduction in hair density from the
beginning to the end of the program with a larger reduction in hair density for thebalding groups even though the hair densities were taken in the region of the scalpbetween the frontal area and crown, a region that is affected by MPA a few yearsafter the frontal region and the crown. The author’s described those areas as moreprone to alopecia. For example, the frontal or crown areas, would show a morerapid decline in hair density over a shorter period of time. The non-balding groupshowed a 7.5% reduction in hair density while the 4 most balding members showeda 19.9% reduction in hair density and the 6 balding member group showed areduction of 15.5% in hair density.Courtois et al. [ 40] graphed their data over 3 year periods plotting the percentageof hairs with a growth period greater than X months for each individual on theabscissa vs. time in months (up to 36) on the ordinate. These curves conﬁrmed that
the ageing process of hairs in males (beginning at ages 25–32 over approximately adecade) shows a general decrease in the lifetime of hair ﬁbers. This reduction in thelifespan of hairs at this stage of life for males was conﬁrmed by analysis of variance.Table 1.7 Hair density of men with and without MPA over an 8–14 year period [ 40]Group Hair density in number of hairs/cm2aBeginning of program End of program Delta Delta/10 yearsNon-Baldingb288.5/C618.4 266.8 /C612.8 21.7 16.7Balding (all 6)c219.7/C638.2 185.7 /C621.1 34.0 36.0Balding (4)d235.8/C636.7 188.8 /C626.1 47.0 49.6aHair density and telogen density were taken on the vertex, between the frontal area and the crown.This area is affected by MPA after the frontal region and the crownbNo signs of alopecia and with telogen density below 15cTwo of these subjects showed only fronto-temporal recession with grade III on the Hamilton scaleand with telogen density approaching 20; the other four subjects are described below

The proportion ofhairs in telogen of these four subjects was approximately 30%22 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
In addition, the ﬁnest hairs displayed the shortest anagen or growth periods, whilethe coarser hairs showed longer periods of growth.Courtois et al. [ 40] pointed out that the average maximum length and the ﬁberdiameters declined as the subjects aged. These scientists approximated hairdiameters by comparing them with ﬁve groups of calibrated strings that were:very ﬁne <35mm; ﬁne 35–50 mm; medium 51–65 mm; thick 66–80 mm and verythick>80mm. Analysis of their data shows that the percentage hairs of the twocoarsest diameter groups for each person of the balding group vs. non-baldinggroup was signiﬁcantly lower at both the beginning and the end of the test. Inaddition, the percentage difference from the beginning to the end of the test for thevery ﬁne diameter hairs of the balding subjects increased more than for the non-balding subjects to a signiﬁcant degree ( p¼0.0006). These results suggest that the
reduction in ﬁber diameter with age for males likely appears over a few or severalhair cycles and therefore could be different from females in FPA as concluded byBirch et al. [ 46].1.4.3 Hair Loss Among WomenFemale pattern alopecia (FPA) occurs as a diffuse reduction in hair density of thefrontal and crown regions of the scalp; see the schematic of Fig. 1.16 depictingLudwig’s [ 47] original characterization of FPA. It usually begins just behind thefrontal hairline, but in some cases the hairline can also decrease in hair density [ 48].At one time it was believed that FPA and MPA were the same disease and both weredue primarily to androgens [ 48]. However, several scientists including Norwoodbelieve that these are two separate diseases. One reason is because the levels ofincidence are different (MPA affects up to 70% of Caucasian males while FPAaffects a little more than 30% of Caucasian women). In addition, MPA begins in
the late teens (sometimes around age 16 for some males) to the early 20s whentestosterone levels are high, while for female Caucasians, FPA begins in thetwenties and peaks after about age 50 when testosterone levels are low. FPAand MPA also begin and occur in different regions of the scalp, compareFigs. 1.16 and1.12.1.4.3.1 The Incidence of Female Pattern Baldness among CaucasiansVersus AsiansNorwood [ 48] determined the incidence of FPA in women by examining a total of1,006 Caucasian women 20–89 years of age. Birch et al. [ 46] conducted animportant study with two groups of women; one group consisted of 377 women,ages 18–99 that came to clinics for dermatologic reasons other than hair disorders.A second group of 47 women came to the clinic for reasons of hair thinning or FPA.These scientists ran several tests on both these groups of women including the1.4 Hair Loss (Alopecia) 23
determination of FPA and hair density. I combined the incidence of FPA of the 377women from the Birch, Messenger and Messenger study with the 1006 women fromthe Norwood study and determined best ﬁtting equations. Predicted percentages ofFPA from this model equation for the combined data of Norwood and Birch,Messenger and Messenger are summarized in Table 1.8.By statistical analysis, the combined data of Norwood and Birch, Messenger andMessenger provides a better ﬁt than the Norwood data alone. I believe that thepredicted values for the incidence of FPA of Table 1.8are the best data currentlyavailable for the incidence of FPA among Caucasians as a function of age. Theincidence of FPA as a function of age of Tables 1.8and1.9, and the schematic ofFig.1.16, deﬁne the incidence and region of the scalp that is most affected by thiscondition.Table 1.8 Predictedincidence of female patternhair-loss among Caucasianwomen from combineddata of Norwood [ 48] andBirch et al.

1.4.3.2 Incidence of FPA Among Caucasians Versus AsiansThe incidence of FPA or extensive hair loss among Asian women is lower thanamong Caucasian women. For example, Paik et al. [ 42] studied hair loss in Koreanmen (5,531) and women (4,601) and found 24.7% of women over 70 years of agehave FPA. This value of 24.7% FPA among Korean women that are more than 70years of age can be compared with 33% among Caucasian women and 15.4%among Chinese women by Xu et al. [ 24].Xu et al. [ 43] studied the incidence of hair loss in Chinese women in Shanghai,China and found a numerically lower incidence of hair loss at all ages than for thestudy among Korean women, see the data of Table 1.9. The hair loss from these twogroups of Asian women is clearly lower at all ages than for the Caucasian women,see Table 1.9. The data was also combined for the Korean and Chinese womenproviding average values used as estimates for Asian women. Ludwig Type I hair
loss was the most common up to the sixth decade for the Korean women. In thesixth decade and at higher ages Ludwig types I and II showed similar occurrence.1.4.3.3 Hair Density of Men Versus Women and Children Versus AdultsThe paper by Birch et al. [ 46] together with papers by Pecoraro [ 28,49,50] and byLoussouarn et al. [ 32,35] provides an entry into hair density as a function of ageamong women. Only relatively small studies (generally at age 35 or less) werefound comparing hair density of men vs. women who were not affected by alopecia.In those cases there were no signiﬁcant differences in hair density among men vs.women. The study by Loussourarn et al. [ 35] summarized by Table 1.4shows lowerhair densities for males than females. These scientists attribute part of that differ-ence to male androgenetic alopecia. If differences do exist in hair density betweenmen and women with no signs of androgenetic alopecia, they must be either smalland or region or age speciﬁc.
Pecoraro, Astore and Barman provide an indication of hair density of childrenbefore puberty [ 49] vs. adults [ 50] in two of their papers. In their paper on adultsfrom ages 16 through 46 (with only 17 males and 22 females), these scientists founda wide range in hair densities from 175 to more than 300 hairs/cm2while Birch et al.[46] found an even wider range from just over 75 to nearly 450 hairs/cm2for morethan 300 females.Pecoraro et al. also estimated hair coarseness using 3 coarseness groups: thick(~100 mm), medium (~50 mm) and ﬁne (~25 mm) and noted a decrease in coarsenessof hair over the entire scalp, in both sexes, as age advances peaking between ages 16
through age 33 and declining from age group 24–33 to the higher age groups. Theyalso noted that the percentage of telogen hairs increased in all scalp regions withincreasing age with the largest change occurring in the coronal region. Note,Pecoraro et al. did not examine the temporal region of the scalp. These scientistsalso noted decreasing hair density especially in the coronal region with increasing1.4 Hair Loss (Alopecia) 25
age, consistent with data of Birch, Messenger and Messenger. Table 1.10 compareshair densities of pre-pubertal children with those of adults. The hair densities foradults of Table 1.10 appear on the low side (compared with the data of Table 1.11);hopefully the relative differences within the study by Pecoraro et al. are moremeaningful. Note the different distribution of hair density on the different scalpregions of the children vs. the adults.As the data of Table 1.10 show, the children display the highest hair density in
the crown or coronal region of the scalp. In direct contrast, adults show the crown tocontain the lowest hair density while the occipital and parietal regions contain thehighest hair counts. But, the parietal regions contain the lowest hair density of thesescalp regions in children. Might this effect in the coronal region vs. the otherregions be a sign that the condition of baldness is already beginning because thecrown or coronal region of the scalp which has the highest hair density beforepuberty becomes the lowest hair density after puberty and is the region or part of theregion most affected by MPA and possibly by FPA.1.4.3.4 Hair Density Versus Age for Caucasian WomenHair densities vs. age in the parietal region of the scalp have been compared for twogroups of Caucasian female panelists, one group by Birch et al. [ 46] and another byRobbins et al. [ 51]. Both data sets show a highly signiﬁcant ﬁt for quadratic and
cubic models for hair density vs. age with a maximum in hair density in the mid toTable 1.10 Comparative hair densities of children vs. adults in different scalp sitesRegion of scalp Children (ages 3–9) [ 49] Adults (ages 16–46) [ 50]Crown or coronal 233 highest density 202 lowest densityParietal 170 lowest density 232 high densityFrontal 196 212Occipital 193 236 highest densityTable 1.11 Data from quadratic models of “normal” subjects vs. subjects with self perceived hairloss [ 51]Predicted hairs per cm2by quadratic model Instantaneous ratesAge “Normal” (N ¼315) Self perceived loss (N ¼1,099) “Normal” Self perceived loss25 291.7 272.4 /C00.86 /C00.6530 286.9 268.0 /C01.05 /C01.1035 281.2 261.4 /C01.23 /C01.5640 274.6 252.5 /C01.42 /C02.0145 267.0 241.3 /C01.61 /C02.4750 258.5 227.8 /C01.79 /C02.9255 249.1 212.1 /C01.98 /C03.3860 238.8 194.1 /C02.17 /C03.8365 227.4 173.8 /C02.36 /C04.2926 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
high twenties age range. A plot of the data by Robbins and Dawson et al. issummarized in Fig. 1.17. For this study, the site was the left and right parietalregion about 3.8 cm from the vertex on each side of the scalp toward the tip of theear for 1021 Caucasian women from age 18 to 66 (providing more than 2,000 datapoints). These women believed they had some hair loss. For this ﬁgure the datawere condensed to 95 data points by ANOVA and then regressed vs. age.Birch et al. [ 46] determined hair densities on another group of Caucasian femalesconsisting of more than 300 women age 17–86 who came to dermatology clinicswith no complaints about baldness. The site in which hair density was determinedwas “within a 1 cm diameter circle, about 2 cm lateral to the midline of the scalp,halfway between the vertex and the frontal hair line” in the parietal region of thescalp. Note, the primary difference in the subjects of these two groups of Caucasian
women was that the Birch, Messenger subjects came to dermatology clinics with nocomplaints of hair loss whereas the Robbins and Dawson et al. [ 51] subjects wereenrolled because they perceived hair loss themselves. Therefore the Birch, Messen-ger group could be called the “normal” or control group.Best ﬁtting quadratic models were calculated and data from both groups of thesepanelists are summarized in Table 1.11. These data conﬁrm the ﬁndings of othersthat there is a gradual decrease in hair density with age from near the mid-twentiesfor female Caucasians which has been shown for other races. Table 1.11 also
contains instantaneous rates of hair loss at different ages for the women with selfperceived hair loss and those with no complaints of hair loss. These rates wereobtained from the ﬁrst derivatives of the quadratic equations from the regressionmodels and show gradual increases in the rates of hair loss with increasing age. Atage 30 and above the differences in these instantaneous rates of hair loss for thesetwo types of panelists become increasingly larger.This latter effect is illustrated by the rates of change of the rates of hair loss(analogous to acceleration constants) calculated from the second derivatives of thequadratic regression models summarized in Table 1.12 and demonstrates that theinstantaneous rates of hair loss from the panelists with self perceived hair loss areincreasing at a faster rate than the “normal” panelists.Fig. 1.17 Hair density (hairs/cm2) vs. age for Caucasianfemales; in the parietal regionof the scalp [ 51]1.4 Hair Loss (Alopecia) 27
Birch, Messenger and Messenger also noted that subjects with high hair density350 or greater tended to display multiple hairs emerging from single follicles, whilethose with low hair densities generally less than 200 usually had single hairs risingfrom most follicle oriﬁces. Others have cited a similar ﬁnding [ 52]. The effects ofmenopause on hair density and diameters are described in Chap. 2in the sectionentitled, The Effects of Menopause on the Lipids in Hair and on the Hair Fiber .Hair loss was studied among Japanese women by Tajima et al. [ 52] and others[53,54]. These scientists examined 159 women (46 suffering from hair loss and 113
with little to no hair loss) showing similar effects to the data of Birch, Messengerand Messenger, that is a decrease in hair density with increasing age beyond themid-twenties. The hair density with respect to age for these Japanese women wereslightly lower (5–20% in the different age groups), but otherwise similar to those ofBirch, Messenger and Messenger among the Caucasian women.1.4.3.5 Factors Involved in the Perception of Female Pattern BaldnessBirch, Messenger and Messenger state in this paper [ 46] that the perception of hairloss is generally determined primarily by decreasing hair density. However, thesescientists add that for initial discrimination between Ludwig type I hair loss(Fig. 1.16) and no hair loss, larger hair diameters could weaken discrimination.
Another way of saying this is that the subjective impression of FPA is multi-factorial involving hair density, hair ﬁber diameter and very likely hair ﬁber curlor the degree of curliness and possibly other factors. The work of Robbins andDawson et al. [ 51] support this proposal by demonstrating that both hair density anddiameter contribute to the perception of the relative hair amount in a new metriccalled “relative hair coverage” described in detail in Chap. 10.Supporting the conclusion that hair curvature should be considered in determin-ing the perception of hair baldness are the facts that increasing hair curvatureincreases hair volume or body and several small studies show that curly Africanhair and African American hair has fewer follicles and fewer hairs/cm2[32,33,35]as compared to Caucasian adult hair and yet the coverage on non-alopecia scalpsappears to be at least equivalent.For women who suffer hair loss such that their hair density is on the low side
(150–200 hairs/cm2), but close to the spectrum of the normal distribution of hairdensity, other factors such as hair ﬁber diameter and the degree of curliness willlikely enter into their subjective interpretation of FPA. A 25–30% hair densitydecrease from 400 hairs/cm2might be detectable for ﬁne straight hair even thoughthe hair density would still appear rather high at nearly 300 hairs/cm2. To illustrateTable 1.12 Comparative rates of change of the rates of hair loss of normal subjects vs. those withself perceived hair loss [ 51]“Normal” subjects Self perceived hair loss subjectsRate of increase of rates of hair loss 0.038 0.09128 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
this point, Birch, Messenger and Messenger found a wide range of hair density insubjects who were not concerned with FPA, ranging from approximately 75 to nearly450 hairs/cm2. In this study, the clinicians classiﬁed more than 50 women (about15%), among this group not concerned with FPA, as having FPA. The median hairdensity of that group with FPA was approximately 188 hairs/cm2, while the medianfor those not classiﬁed as having FPA was approximately 263 hairs/cm2. Birch et al.[46] also classiﬁed three women with a little more than 300 hairs/cm2as having FPA.Now, if these high hair density women had very ﬁne and straight hair and they hadundergone nearly 30% hair loss from about 430 to 300 hairs/cm2then they wouldlikely have been classiﬁed clinically as having FPA.1.4.3.6 Normal or Acceptable Hair LossSo, what is “normal” hair loss that is acceptable to women? The data of Table 1.11
along with the work of Birch et al. suggests that some women can suffer as much as25–37% hair loss or decrease in hair density without complaining about hair loss.So, I conclude that a hair density decrease of 30 /C65% in the top central area of thescalp just behind the frontal hairline, would be the borderline hair loss at which thefactors of hair ﬁber diameter and hair ﬁber curl become more and more importantwith regard to the self determination or perception of a problem with hair lossamong women. If the hair is ﬁne and straight then a hair density decrease less than30% will likely cause concern.Interestingly, another group of women that Birch, Messenger and Messengerstudied was a group of women who came to the clinic with hair loss as their majorcomplaint. The most severe hair loss among this group had hair density less than125 hairs/cm2. Assuming a starting point at 290 hairs/cm2would provide a hair
density decrease of 57%. So clearly a hair density decrease of more than 50%should provide a real hair loss problem for most women regardless of ﬁber diameteror degree of curl.1.4.3.7 Hair Miniaturization or Diameter Change in FemalesVersus MalesBirch et al. [ 46] examined hair ﬁber diameter changes and found an extremely weakcorrelation between hair ﬁber diameter changes and hair density, R2<0.03. Thisconclusion is consistent with the fact that maximum diameter for women occurs inthe early to mid-forties [ 51] and then decreases with advancing age as most of theliterature suggests, see Chap. 9for additional details. On the other hand, maximumhair density occurs in the mid-to-late-twenties [ 51].Birch et al. [ 46] concluded that if hair miniaturization does occur in FPA it must
be different from the balding process in men. Moreover, they suggested that theminiaturization of hairs likely occurs rapidly inside a single hair cycle or over a fewyears in FPA as opposed to a lengthy gradual process over several hair cycles for1.4 Hair Loss (Alopecia) 29
MPA. I could ﬁnd no conﬁrmation of this suggestion in the literature. Nevertheless,this is an interesting observation that needs to be re-examined, because if it iscorrect it is very important.1.4.4 Pregnancy and its Effects on Scalp HairOne of the clearest non-technical summaries of what happens during pregnancy canbe found in the following website of the Mayo Clinic at mayoclinic.com :T h i swebsite explains that hormone levels during pregnancy inhibit normal hair loss onthe scalp. Therefore, during pregnancy one usually observes a “lush head of hair”.But, after delivery, the excess hair is shed in a very short timeframe. This effectoften provides a shock to the postpartum mother. But, usually within 6 months thehair returns to normal.As indicated, the mechanism for hair growth involves three stages: A growing
period called anagen; a transition period, catagen and a resting period, telogen. Attelogen, the “old” hair falls out and is replaced by a “new” hair ﬁber. The time-spanof anagen is normally 2–6 years which determines how coarse and how long scalphair ﬁbers become. The time-span of anagen is shortest for infants, longer forchildren and longest from puberty to young adulthood (~ages 13–30). Then some-time in the adult stage of life, anagen becomes shorter with further advancing age,earlier for men (late teens to 20) than for women (mid-to-late-twenties). Thepercentage of hairs in anagen is normally 85–90% and most of the other hairs arein telogen. The lower the percentage of anagen hairs means more hair fall out andusually signiﬁes alopecia.Lynﬁeld [ 37] was the ﬁrst to provide a general understanding of what happens to
scalp hair during and after pregnancy. Lynﬁeld concluded, contrary to the existingview in 1960, that the time of onset and the length of time that hair loss occurspostpartum are highly variable. Lynﬁeld determined that the period of anagen islonger than normal during pregnancy; therefore there is less fallout during that time.However, after delivery there is usually a larger amount of hair loss than normal.Lynﬁeld [ 37] began her study with 26 Caucasian women (ages 17–38) andexamined the hair roots of different numbers of these women during and afternormal pregnancies. She compared her data with a control group of 30 healthy non-pregnant women ranging from age 17 to 40. Lynﬁeld determined anagen andtelogen counts by examining hair roots of 50 hairs at a time, in both the frontaland temporal scalp. She focused her results primarily on temple hair since thetemporal data provided less experimental scatter, but she indicated that the changeswere parallel in both regions of the scalp.
were parallel in both regions of the scalp.Lynﬁeld’s [ 37] data showed normal anagen percentages, near 85%, in the ﬁrsttrimester of pregnancy for ﬁve subjects. These percentages compared favorablywith the mean anagen hairs in the non-pregnant control group at 85 /C65.6%(mean /C6standard deviation). During the second and third trimester and the ﬁrstweek postpartum, the anagen levels rose to 95%, 94% and 94% respectively.30 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
However, in the sixth week postpartum the anagen levels dropped to 76% and 77%and in the few cases examined at a later time (not speciﬁed, but 5 and 8 months fromthe graph of one subject) the anagen density generally returned to normal. Lynﬁeldnoted that contrary to the existing view in 1960, her data indicated that the time ofonset and the length of time that hair loss occurs postpartum are highly variable.The time of onset began almost immediately after delivery in two women, 1 monthpostpartum in 1 and 4 months postpartum in another and it lasted up to 5 months.Lynﬁeld [ 37] described one clear exception as a 38 year old woman in herseventh pregnancy whose anagen levels were essentially unchanged and no clinicalhair loss was detected. Lynﬁeld speculated that after several pregnancies the hairroots of this woman did not respond to “hormonal ﬂuctuations of pregnancy”. Shealso described ﬁve other women whose anagen counts decreased postpartum, but no
hair loss could be detected by the clinicians. So, not only are the times of onset andthe length of hair loss postpartum highly variable, but the clinical detection of hairloss postpartum is also highly variable.Pecoraro et al. [ 55] reported an increase in the proportions of thick to mediumand thin hairs during pregnancy. Nissimov and Elchalal [ 56] conﬁrmed this ﬁndingand identiﬁed that the mean major-axis diameter of scalp hair was higher in 12pregnant vs. 13 non-pregnant women. The major-axis diameters of the pregnantwomen increased (+4.5%), and this increase was ﬁrst detected at about 2 weeksafter conception through the 35th week of pregnancy. On the other hand, the major-axis diameters of the non-pregnant women decreased ( /C05.2%) toward the scalpover the same 35 week period. This difference is statistically signiﬁcant at a highlevel of conﬁdence.About a little more than a decade ago, Hutchinson and Thompson [ 57] reported
changes in the major-axis diameter of human scalp hairs that they associated withchanges occurring inside the follicle. They concluded that hair ﬁbers are notuniform cylinders, but from the distal end toward the scalp there is an increase insize over about a 6–8 cm length (about 3 weeks growth) of ﬁber, that theyassociated with the start up of anagen. After that distance the major-axis of thehair ﬁber decreased progressively through anagen. These effects were conﬁrmed bythe work of Nissimov and Elchalal [ 56]. See the section on hair ﬁber ellipticity inChap. 9for additional discussion on the effect of diameter and ellipticity changeson single hairs over time.The only data I could ﬁnd on growth rates during pregnancy are by Pecoraroet al. [ 55] which indicated 0.0325 cm/day in the ﬁrst trimester, 0.0315 cm/day in thesecond trimester and 0.0329 cm/day in the third trimester. Comparing these datawith Pecoraro’s [ 50] data in an earlier publication shows adult scalp hair of females
grows at 0.0344 cm/day. This suggests that the growth rate slows down duringpregnancy. This growth rate effect, if real, could relate to the body compensatingfor the increased protein demand and number of hair cells required by thicker hairﬁbers produced during pregnancy and the increase in the number of anagen hairﬁbers.The thorough review paper by Ohnemus et al. [ 58] describes the hair follicle as atarget for estrogen, but cautiously states that because of the complex associated1.4 Hair Loss (Alopecia) 31
endocrine changes during and after pregnancy it is still not clear whether estrogensor other hormones initiate these effects on hair ﬁbers during and after pregnancy.Also, more data with larger numbers of subjects on hair density of males andfemales of different geo-racial groups vs. age would be helpful for predictingeffects of important cosmetic hair properties and treatments vs. age.1.4.5 Alopecia Areata, Universalis and Other Formsof Hair LossAlopecia areata, another form of hair loss, is believed to be related to the immunesystem (e.g., autoimmunity). This disease generally occurs as patchy baldness on anotherwise normal scalp, although sometimes hair of other body regions is affected.When the entire scalp is involved, the condition is called alopecia totalis. If terminalhair loss occurs over the entire body, a rare condition, it is called alopeciauniversalis. Emotional stress has been shown to be one of the initiating causes of
areata. See the section in Chap. 7entitled, Sudden Graying-whitening of Hair wherealopecia areata has been suggested to be involved. Topical application of steroids issometimes used to treat areata. However, even when untreated the balding area intime often returns to normal hair growth.Alopecia induced by physical stress has been termed trichotillomania. Thiscondition occurs from physically pulling or twisting a localized area of hair untilnoticeable thinning develops. This type of hair loss sometimes occurs in childrenwho unconsciously pull or twist a group of hairs. A similar type of hair loss alsooccurs in adults.Telogen efﬂuvium is a term used to describe a sudden but diffuse hair loss that isoften caused by an acute physical or psychological stress. This condition usuallylasts only a few months and is often reversible. Telogen efﬂuvium has beenassociated with dandruff and its treatment is described in Chap. 6in the sectionon dandruff.
on dandruff.Drugs used in chemotherapy often induce alopecia. However, this type of hairloss is also usually reversible and the “new hair” after chemotherapy can be of adifferent curvature or a different color than the hair prior to chemical treatment.1.5 A Mechanism for Hair Growth/Hair Loss and Changein Hair SizeThe ratio of anagen to telogen hairs indicates whether hair growth or hair loss isoccurring. The length of anagen activity controls the changes in hair size that occurduring different stages of the life of mammals. At different ages of humans, such asshortly after birth, at puberty or at maturity, hairs grow to different sizes (different32 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
lengths and diameters). All of these changes generally involve hormones or chemi-cal messengers. See the section in Chap. 2entitled Aging Inﬂuences on Hair and theprevious section on Hair Growth in this Chapter.Loussouarn et al. [ 35] described hair growth rates of scalp hair for three differentgeo-racial groups in these three scalp regions (vertex, temple and occipital). Thisstudy showed that the growth rate of the hair of East Asians is higher than that ofeither Caucasians or Africans, see Table 1.13. The growth rates of the scalp hair forfemales of these three geo-racial groups’ shows that the scalp hair of Africansgrows slower than the scalp hair for either Caucasian or Asian females. Further-more, the growth rate of the scalp hair of Asian females is slightly higher than thatof Caucasian females.The growth rates of males of these same geo-racial groups is summarized inTable 1.13 and parallels the growth rates for females showing slower rates for
Africans in all three scalp regions and slightly higher growth rates for Asians thanCaucasians.Over the past ﬁve decades, many ingredients have been demonstrated to eitherinhibit or to promote hair growth, see Table 1.14. More than 40 years ago, Hamilton[59] demonstrated that androgens are a factor in male pattern baldness. For exam-ple, long-term injections of testosterone induced a rapid transformation of terminalhairs to vellus hairs in the frontal scalp of stump-tailed macaques [ 59,60]. Thus,testosterone, an androgen, produced by the adrenals and the sex glands was shownto play a critical role in controlling the growth patterns of human scalp hair ﬁbers.Estrogen, a generic term for any substance that exerts biological effects ashormones like estradiol, have been shown to produce positive effects on hair growthwhen taken internally or applied topically. Systemic estrogen probably prolongs theanagen phase of hair growth by suppressing androgen production [ 60], and both
estrogens and anti-androgens when applied topically have been shown to be capableof suppressing hair loss as shown by Schumacher-Stock [ 61]. Anti-androgens,substances that are capable of blocking androgen function, include spironolactone,cyproterone acetate, progesterone, ﬁnasteride (Fig. 1.18) and dutasteride. These lasttwo ingredients of Table 1.14 are inhibitors of 5-alpha-reductase an importantTable 1.13 Rates of growth of hair of different geo-racial groups (all panelists 18–35 years ofage) [ 35]Growth rate in terms of micrometers/dayaAfrican Asian (China) CaucasianFemale Male Female Male Female MaleN¼110 N ¼106 N ¼96 N ¼92 N ¼51 N ¼56Vertex 294 /C649 282 /C652 413 /C651 430 /C655 379 /C651 364 /C666Temple 282 /C646 286 /C650 393 /C655 406 /C646 357 /C653 368 /C657Occipital 274 /C659 258 /C648 410 /C654 417 /C650 364 /C656 371 /C653Total mean 284 /C649 275 /C651 405 /C654 418 /C651 366 /C654 368 /C658

enzyme in the conversion of androgens to the most active form of testosterone. Thetopical application of estrogens and anti-androgens probably cause a local inhibitionof the androgen function and demonstrate one solution to hair growth, as shown bythe proposed mechanism below.Chemical cures for baldness and the search for a better understanding of themechanism of this phenomenon often involve androgens, genetic studies and drugsknown to be capable of inducing hypertrichosis, such as streptomycin, cyclosporin,diazoxide, tacrolimus (fujimycin), estradiol, oxandrolone, minoxidil, ﬁnasterideand dutasteride. Several of these drugs have shown promise in reversing thesymptoms of male pattern baldness. Minoxidil and ﬁnasteride are currently soldas active ingredients in hair growth products.Minoxidil (6-amino-1, 2-dihydro-1-hydroxy-imino-4-piperidino pyrimidine)
has been shown to re-grow hair with minimal side effects. This drug is a vasodilatorand a potassium channel opener. It was originally developed by Upjohn fortreatment of hypertension, and has been shown to be capable of reversing malepattern alopecia in clinical trials during treatment periods. However, with minoxi-dil, best results are obtained under occlusion and in subjects whose condition ofbalding has not progressed for many years. The re-growth is concentration depen-dent with a higher efﬁcacy at 5% than 2% active ingredient. Minoxidil is currentlysold as a topically applied drug under the trade name Rogaine.Finasteride (see Fig. 1.18) a drug developed by Merck & Co. for treatment ofbenign prostate hypertrophy has been shown to inhibit the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase, and thus, to block the conversion of testosterone to the more active5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) [ 62,63]. There are two forms of the enzyme
5-alpha-reductase, called Type I and Type II. Finasteride is capable of blockingonly the Type II enzyme which is the predominate form of this enzyme in the hairTable 1.14 Some ingredientsknown to affect hair growthRetard hair growth Promote hair growthTestosterone StreptomycinDihydrotestosterone CyclosporinRetinoids DiazoxideRetinoic acid EstrogensRetinol EstradiolEﬂornithineaProgesteroneSpironolactoneMinoxidilbFinasteridecDutasteridecMolecular signals essential to follicle induction and growth suchas BMP’s, sonic hedgehog, several WNT proteins and severalreceptors such as BMPRIA EGFR, EGRF and TGFR were notincluded in this tableaChemotherapy drug (known to inhibit polyamine biosynthesisand ornithine decarboxylase)bPotassium channel opener and vasodilatorcInhibits 5-alpha-reductase (conversion of testosterone todihydrotestosterone)34 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
follicles and the prostate gland. This action in hair follicles (partially blocks theconversion of testosterone to DHT) suppresses the androgen inhibition of hairsynthesis in the hair follicle, thus extending the anagen period to provide longerand coarser hairs [ 64,65]. Sung et al. [ 66] provided evidence that DHT up-regulatesDKK-1 from dermal papilla cells thus causing apoptosis in keratinocytes andinhibits hair growth.Propecia is the trade name for the hair treatment form of ﬁnasteride, sold in pillform and taken orally. It is recommended only for males because of potentialFig. 1.18 Chemical structures of the active androgens, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone(DHT ), some examples of antiandrogens, an estrogen and ﬁnasteride1.5 A Mechanism for Hair Growth/Hair Loss and Change in Hair Size 35
problems during pregnancy. Dutasteride (Avodart, a drug for benign prostatehyperplasia) from Glaxo has been touted as an effective hair growth agent thatworks similar to ﬁnasteride, but it has a longer half life (longer residence time in thebody), is more active in inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase and more importantly itinhibits both Type I and Type II forms of the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase.Dutasteride is more effective in lowering DHT levels and appears to work fasterin the treatment of baldness than ﬁnasteride. However, as of this writing the data isnot clear that it is a more effective treatment for androgenetic alopecia.Normal control of the anagen/telogen cycle by the action of androgens (such asthe action of 5-alpha-reductase on testosterone), or by anti-androgens and thesubsequent alteration of hairs to different sizes is summarized below, also seeFig.1.11: Molecular signals (Wnt proteins and Sonic hedgehog) most likely from
mesenchymal cells called dermal condensate are transported to stem cells in thebulge (Fig. 1.5) to initiate lower follicle formation and anagen [ 11–22,67].Oshima et al. [ 68] described that stem cells in the bulge move downward in thefollicle and divide rapidly to form the follicle matrix. The follicle matrix thenbegins producing inner and outer root sheath cells and ultimately cuticle, cortex andmedullary cells along with the other essential proteins and structures in the lowerfollicle, see Fig. 1.6.Cell division continues at a rapid rate and differentiation occurs as the hair shaftcells move upward in the follicle. During various stages of growth, signalingmolecules and metabolites are transported between the different cellular layers ofFig.1.6to the sites where they exert their activity.The synthesis or the production of androgens by the adrenals and the ovaries or
the testes occurs. These androgenic hormones are transported in the blood streamon carrier proteins such as sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), to peripheraltissues such as the pilosebaceous apparatus. These hormones then dissociate fromthe binding proteins.Testosterone is converted in the hair follicle to the more active hormone DHT.Testosterone and DHT are transported into hair cells. These steroids act insidethe keratinocytes to induce apoptosis most likely involving a receptor protein.Thus, any agent or process that either enhances or interferes with any of thesesteps will lead to either greater or less production of longer more coarse hairs.Interference in the transport of androgenic hormones in the blood stream may resultin terminal hairs being produced where vellus hairs are normally produced. Forexample, Barth [ 69] has shown that the step involving the transport of testosterone
on carrier proteins occurs in hirsute women. This effect leads to a reduction intransport proteins (SHBG) and the concomitant increase in the free unboundtestosterone level in the blood stream. Thus, the transport mechanism is interferedwith and thick terminal hairs are produced in body regions where they are notnormally produced.Not only is the transport of testosterone important, transport of other androgenscapable of being synthesized into testosterone is also important, because Sawayaet al. [ 70] demonsrated that the enzyme 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenasewhich converts other androgens into testosterone (see Fig. 1.19) shows greater36 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
activity in samples of balding scalp as compared to normal hairy scalp. In addition,balding men show increased activity of the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase in thepilosebaceous units and in the skin of the frontal scalp. On the other hand, Grifﬁnet al. [ 71] concluded that men with a deﬁciency of this enzyme do not developbaldness. Also see the section entitled Gene Therapy for Potential Treatments forHair Loss later in this chapter.As indicated, androgens including testosterone are produced by the testes andthe adrenal glands [ 72] and then transported to the sites of activity. Hair root cellscontain androgen receptors; however, there is evidence that these receptors areintra-nuclear rather than intracellular, see King and Greene [ 73] and Welshons et al.[74]. In addition, Sawaya et al. [ 75] demonstrated a greater androgen bindingcapacity (DHT) in the nuclei of sebaceous glands taken from patients with bald
scalps than from patients with normal hairy scalps. Thus DHT migrates into haircells in the lower follicle and induces apoptosis to inhibit hair growth and shortenthe anagen period.Consistent with this ﬁnding is the one by Orentriech [ 76] that pilosebaceousunits that grow thick terminal hairs when surgically transplanted to a region thatis hairless will continue to grow thick terminal hairs. In some cases thick terminalhairs will begin to grow, sometimes in isolation, in regions that are normallyhairless, such as the growth of facial hair in women, etc. In other words, theFig. 1.19 The conversion of androgens to testosterone and DHT1.5 A Mechanism for Hair Growth/Hair Loss and Change in Hair Size 37
response to the androgens are dependent on the speciﬁc pilosebaceous unit which isoften, but not always regionally dependent. These ﬁndings suggest that speciﬁcpilosebaceous units are somehow programmed to respond to androgens in a waythat either induce baldness or grow hair possibly by means of different receptorproteins or another mechanism.Different receptor proteins for stimulating or retarding hair growth help toexplain several apparently disparate facts. In the case of males, at puberty, thickterminal hairs begin to grow in the axilla, the mons pubis and the beard areas. Thisaction occurs in spite of increased levels of testosterone and contrasts to whatoccurs later (at about age 20 in males) when increased levels of testosterone in thescalp help to cause male pattern baldness. Hamilton et al. [ 77] also demonstratedthat eunuchs when injected intramuscularly with testosterone propionate exhibit an
increased growth of coarse sternal hairs and yet, eunuchs when castrated before age20 show even less growth of beard hair than eunuchs castrated after age 21 [ 78], seeTable 1.15.The ﬁrst experiment involving testosterone injection, suggests that this androgencan somehow induce or promote hair growth in the skin of the thorax tissues, asopposed to the scalp, where this same hormone inhibits hair growth. The secondexperiment among eunuchs shows that a decrease in testosterone level in somebody regions, such as the beard area in males decreases hair growth. Additionally, itdemonstrates that removal of two of the glands that produce this hormone prior tothe maturation of the local tissue (e.g., the scalp) responsible for hair growth, thenhair growth will be further inhibited in that tissue. In other words, hair growth isdependent on the local tissue (most likely through speciﬁc receptor sites in thetissue) as well as the androgen level.
Epidermal growth factor receptors have been detected in the outer root sheathand in the epidermal papilla by Wollina and Knopf [ 79] and epidermal growthfactors have been linked to the anagen to catagen transformation as shown byPhilpott and Kealey [ 80]. Receptors for thyroid hormone have also been detected inkeratinocytes by Mackenzie [ 81].In addition to hormonal control and molecular signaling compounds, vitaminsand retinoids, and mesenchymal components have been shown to help control thedevelopment of follicles and to maintain hair growth. These are fruitful areas of hairgrowth research. For entries into this literature, see the references by Alonso andFuchs [ 12], Reddy et al. [ 67], Mackenzie [ 81], Hebert [ 82], Stenn [ 83] andBlumberg and Tonnic-Canic [ 84] and the following references [ 11–21].Retinoids including vitamin A, retinol and retinoic acid play an important role inthe growth and development of epithelial tissue. In excess, vitamin A and its

derivatives have been shown to inhibit keratinization [ 84]. This effect is likelyrelated to DHT production. The sebaceous glands produce sebum that containsDHT. At too high a level, DHT inhibits hair growth and when used with minoxidil ithas been shown to increase the effectiveness of the latter. This effect may be relatedto proper control of sebum production and DHT levels.Vitamin D3, however, promotes keratinization [ 84]. On the other hand, there areno scientiﬁc studies on healthy subjects demonstrating the effects of dietaryvitamins on hair growth. In the case of dietary insufﬁciency, there are indicationsthat folic acid (a B-complex vitamin) and pyridoxine (a B-complex vitamin, B6)“may” be helpful to hair growth. Reis [ 85] described a role in cystine metabolismfor these vitamins. Panthenol the precursor to pantothenic acid (another B-complexvitamin) has not been demonstrated to affect the growth or development of hair
either in a dietary study or through topical application. Other materials known toeither inhibit or promote hair growth are listed in Table 1.14. Eﬂornithine achemotherapy drug known to retard hair growth has been explored in a joint venturewith Gillette and Bristol-Myers Squibb as the active ingredient for a topicallyapplied prescription product to help control facial hair in women.To summarize hair growth, human scalp hair grows at an average rate ofapproximately 15 cm (about 6 in. per year). The life cycle of a hair ﬁber consistsof three stages—anagen (growth stage), catagen (transition stage), and telogen
(resting stage when the hair is shed). The life cycle of a hair ﬁber is initiated bychemical messengers that act on stem cells in the bulge. Wnt proteins, Sonichedgehog and other regulators play a primary role in the anagen phase. Hair growthis partially controlled by androgens and the local tissue most likely through speciﬁcreceptor sites. Testosterone and DHT are the primary androgens that determinewhether hairs increase or decrease in size with age and some other aspects of hairgrowth and hair loss. During various stages of growth, signaling molecules andmetabolites are transported between the different cell layers of Fig. 1.6to the sitewhere they activate the tissues. In spite of the fact that each follicular unit canfunction independently, the response by the local tissue tends to be a regionalresponse and it determines whether hairs grow or whether the hair cycle is short-ened and ultimately leads to baldness.
Differences in anagen can vary from a few months to up to 8 years or longer. Fornormal terminal scalp hairs, 2–6 years anagen is an average growth time, producinghairs approximately 1 m long (~3 ft) before shedding. Human hair generally growsin a mosaic pattern, thus, in any given area of the scalp, one ﬁnds hairs in variousstages of their life cycle. In a normal healthy scalp, the vast majority of hairs are inanagen (about 80–90%); although there are seasonal changes in hair growth, withmaximum shedding (telogen) as Autumn approaches (in the Northern Hemisphere,August/September). In all forms of hair loss, there is a more rapid turnover totelogen, thus a larger percentage of hairs are in telogen. In addition, vellus hairs,characterize baldness, although a small reduction in the number of follicles per unitarea also occurs. For additional details regarding the biological syntheses andformation of human hair, see references [ 9–21,26,68–70,75,79–89]. Different
treatments for hair loss are described in the next sections of this chapter.1.5 A Mechanism for Hair Growth/Hair Loss and Change in Hair Size 39
1.6 Treatments for Hair LossStudies are currently underway to identify the genes involved in androgeneticalopecia, alopecia areata and alopecia totalis and alopecia universalis. As of late2003, only one gene involved in androgenetic alopecia had been identiﬁed, that isthe androgen receptor (AR) [ 90]. However, a lot of good work has been accom-plished since that time. A summary of the science related to the role of genes andtheir products in relation to different types of baldness is described in Chap. 3in thesection entitled, Some Other Hair Traits Related to Genetics. If you are interested inthis area, see references [ 90–93], the references in that section of Chap. 3and readcurrent works by the following scientists: Barahmani, N., Botchkarev, V., Brent-
Richards, J., Christiano, A., Cotsarelis, G., Cox, G., Dawber, R.P.R., Duvic, M.,Ellis, J.A., Fuchs, E., Harrap, S., Hillmer, A.M., Lui, H., Rogers, G., Rothnagel, J.A.,Sawaya, M., Shapiro, J., Sinclair, R., Sundberg, J., Tang, L. and Whiting, D.A.1.6.1 Surgical Treatment of Hair LossSeveral surgical procedures have been used for treatment of hair loss. Althoughthese procedures may be used for most forms of alopecia, they are used primarilyfor treatment of androgenetic alopecia or for hair loss due to tissue injury such asburns, particularly in cases where extensive baldness exists. These procedures arebased on the fact that hairs actively growing in one region of the scalp, such as theoccipital region when moved with local tissue to a bald region will continue to growas they did in the occipital region. These procedures conﬁrm the role of local tissuecontrol in the hair growth process. Current surgical treatments include:• Hair transplantation
• Hair transplantation• Scalp reduction• Transposition ﬂap• Soft tissue expansionIn the most common form of hair transplantation, small skin plugs containing15–20 growing terminal hairs each are surgically removed and placed into a smallercylindrical hole in the balding region of the scalp. Usually several sessions oftransplantation are required involving the placement of 50 or more plugs persession. The placement or angling of the plugs is important to the end cosmeticeffect. Elliptical grafts or even smaller mini-grafts may be employed and have beendescribed by Shiell and Norwood [ 94]. Within 2–4 weeks after transplantation, thedonor hairs usually fall out and are replaced by new hairs.Lasers have been introduced into hair transplantation providing severaladvantages. Erbium and CO2lasers have been used. More advantages have been
2lasers have been used. More advantages have beenshown by the erbium laser. It allows for a smaller graft and offers the potential tocreate closer sites for more aesthetic results. Both techniques provide virtually40 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
bloodless surgery and reduce operating times compared with conventionaltechniques. A diode laser was cleared by the FDA in 1998 and is currently beingused for hair removal. This laser functions with 800 nm light and has a coolingdevice for patient comfort. It provides safe and effective hair removal with virtuallyno scarring and a decrease in the delay for hair re-growth.Oftentimes, in cases where the bald area is rather large, scalp reduction is done inconjunction with hair transplantation. This method involves surgical excision of astrip of the bald skin to reduce the total hairless area. Repeated scalp reductions canbe performed together with transplantation to provide better coverage for a verybald person.The transposition ﬂap method [ 95] involves moving a ﬂap of skin that contains adense area of hair to a bald area. This method is sometimes employed together withmini-graft implantation along the frontal hairline to provide a more naturalappearance.
Soft tissue expansion is another surgical development for treatment of alopecia.In this procedure, soft silicone bags are inserted under the skin in the hair-bearingarea of the scalp, usually in the occipital region. The bags are then slowly ﬁlled withsalt water during a 2–4 month time period. After expansion of the hair-bearing skin,the bags are removed and the bald area of the scalp is excised and ﬂaps are createdwith the expanded hair-bearing skin.1.6.2 Hair Multiplication or Hair Induction Treatmentsfor Hair LossSome novel and highly technical treatments for hair loss are being explored withencouraging but modest success. Some have referred to these treatments as cloning;however, cloning involves the production of a genetically identical organism.
Cloning is clearly not what is being done for the growth of hair ﬁbers (not anorganism) on scalps. One successful technique described by Reynolds and Jahoda[96] was ﬁrst called Trans-gender induction of hair follicles. This method has alsobeen referred to as hair follicle cell transplantation. In this procedure portions ofspeciﬁc cellular structures such as dermal sheath cells are micro-surgically removedfrom actively growing hairs and injected into the skin of another person. Theimplanted cells act to promote the formation of new intact hairs. In the casedescribed by Reynolds and Jahoda [ 96], the donor cells were from a male andimplanted into a female, thus the name “transgender” induction. It would appearthat some variation on this procedure offers potential as a treatment for hair loss.But, this procedure is only a laboratory curiosity and several steps are necessary todetermine if this type of treatment can be brought to fruition. Unger [ 97] described
current concepts, techniques and the future of transplantation in a paper publishedin the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.1.6 Treatments for Hair Loss 41
1.6.3 Hair Extensions or Hair WeavesThis technique of adding or attaching hair to your own hair to provide differentstyles or looks has become popular. Hair extensions originated and were ﬁrst madepopular among African American women such as Janet Jackson, however womenof all races today are taking advantage of the styles and looks that weaves provide,if they can afford it. There are several basic techniques for applying hair extensions:The fusion method sometimes called infusion: This method involves gluingindividual hairs; strand by strand or micro-braids to the subject’s own strands ofhair. Hair strands can be purchased with pre-applied adhesive that must be heated orglue sticks that require heating with a device similar to a glue gun to activate theadhesive. Infusion is the most expensive hair extension method because it takes8–16 h to manually complete. This process lasts several months allowing contactwith water such as shampooing once a week and even swimming.
Bonding involves gluing large strips of hair sometimes called wefts to the rootsof the subject’s own hair. Bonding glue and remover are sold along with wefts forthis process. Bonded hair should not be left in place longer than 1 or 2 weeksbecause of stress on the roots.Weaving is a process where a corn row or a track is created around the head withthe subject’s own hair. Extension hair is then sewn or woven onto the tracks and thesubject’s own hair lays over the tracks for a natural look.Netting is where natural hair tresses are braided or woven onto a thin breathablenet that ﬁts onto the scalp. Netting can last up to 3 months, however care must betaken to dry the subjects own hair to avoid mildewing.Because hair extensions provide for a natural look and optional styles they havebecome popular among female entertainers such as Beyonce, Janet Jackson,Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Jessica Simpson and many others.1.7 The Cuticle, Cortex, Medulla and Cell MembraneComplex
Complex1.7.1 The CuticleThe cuticle is a chemically resistant region surrounding the cortex in animal hairﬁbers (see Figs. 1.3,1.7and1.8). Geiger [ 98] described its chemical resistance inthe following manner. When isolated cuticle material and whole wool ﬁber arecompletely reduced and alkylated, the alkali solubility [ 99] of the cuticle material isapproximately one-half that of whole ﬁber (85%). Cuticle cells are generallyisolated from keratin ﬁbers by shaking in formic acid [ 100], by enzymatic digestion[98,101,102], or by shaking in water [ 103]. Atsuta et al. [ 104] successfully appliedthe method of Taki for removing cuticle cells from wool ﬁber to remove cuticle42 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
from human hair ﬁbers. This method involves shaking hair ﬁbers for several hourswith 5–6% potassium hydroxide in 1-butanol.The cuticle consists of ﬂat overlapping cells (scales) that surround the centralﬁber core (Figs. 1.8,1.20, and 1.21). The cuticle cells are attached at the proximalend (root end), and they point toward the distal end (tip end) of the hair ﬁber, likeshingles on a roof. The shape and orientation of the cuticle cells are responsible forthe differential friction effect in hair (see Chap. 9). Each cuticle cell is approxi-mately 0.5 mm thick, with about a 6–7 mm exposed axial surface or scale interval,and approximately 45–60 mm long. A comprehensive study by Takahashi et al.[105] on about 200 Asians and 200 Caucasians showed an average scale thicknessof 0.45 mm for Asians and 0.43 mm for Caucasians, a surface cuticle interval of6.61mm for Asians and 6.98 mm for Caucasians within 1 cm of the scalp. The scale
interval is in agreement with earlier data by Hardy [ 91] showing slightly morescales per 0.52 mm for Asians (15.47) vs. Caucasians (15.07) and more scales perunit length for people of East African descent (17.92). See the section in Chap. 9entitled Scale Type of Mammalian Hairs is Related to Hair Fiber Diameter .The cuticle in human scalp hair is generally 6–8 scales thick for Asians andCaucasians with slightly more scales in Asians as shown in a study by Hardy [ 106]and Takahashi [ 105]. Other studies with fewer subjects show variation from about 5to 10 cuticle layers [ 100,101]. The schematic of Fig. 1.22 by Alan Swift [ 107]illustrates similar dimensions and the layering of the cuticle. Woods and Orwin[108] describe the formation of the single layer of overlapping scales in most woolﬁbers that is sometimes described as 1–2 scales thick. The number of scale layerscan serve as a clue to the species of origin in forensic studies.

The cuticle of virgin human hair contains smooth unbroken scale edges at theroot or proximal end near the scalp (see Fig. 1.21). Cuticle damage evidenced bybroken scale edges can usually be observed a few centimeters away from the scalp.Such damage is caused by weathering and mechanical damage from the effects ofnormal grooming actions, such as combing, brushing and shampooing (Figs. 1.21and1.23). In many long hair ﬁbers (25 cm or longer), progressive surface damagemay be observed (illustrated by Fig. 1.23). Stage 1 shows intact smooth scale edgesand scale surfaces; stage 2 contains broken scale edges; in stage 3, the scales havebeen partially removed, and in stage 4 the hair splits indicating extensive corticaldamage. Garcia et al. described this phenomenon of hair degradation in some detail[109]. See Chap. 6for additional information and references on this importantphenomenon.The cuticle of both human hair and wool ﬁber has been shown to contain a higher
percentage of cystine than whole ﬁber [ 110] and more of the other amino acids thatare generally not found in alpha-helical polypeptides [ 111].

of wool ﬁber by the polarizing microscope shows negligible birefringence [ 1]. Thecuticle of human hair also demonstrates negligible birefringence. Astbury andStreet [ 112] provided x-ray evidence conﬁrming that, in contrast to the cortex;the cuticle of hairs does not contain crystalline domains and as such is not as highlyorganized at the molecular level as the cortex.1.7.1.1 The Different Layers of the CuticleThe schematic diagram of Fig. 1.24 illustrates the internal structure of cuticle cells.The uppermost structure of each cuticle cell contains a thin proteinaceous mem-brane, the epicuticle that is covered with a lipid layer that includes 18-methyleicosanoic acid. Different estimates of the thickness of this lipo-protein membranehave been cited [ 113,114]; however, 10–14 nm by Swift and Smith [ 115]i sprobably the best current estimate. See the section entitled the Cell MembraneComplex including the Intercellular Matter and the Nonkeratin Regions of Hair in
this chapter and Chap. 2on this same subject. See also the schematics in that samesection in this chapter and the section in Chap. 6entitled The Hair Fiber Surface .Beneath the cuticle cell membranes are three major layers; the A layer, a highlycross linked resistant layer about 50–100 nm thick (see Fig. 1.24). The A layercontains a high cystine content ( >30%) and additional cross links called isopeptidebonds found by Zahn et al. [ 116]. Isopeptide bonds are created by reaction ofglutamine with lysine under the inﬂuence of a transglutaminase enzyme. Theexocuticle, sometimes called the B layer, is beneath the A-layer. It is also rich incystine (~15–20%) and highly variable in thickness in each cuticle cell averagingabout 150 nm. Underneath the exocuticle is the endocuticle, low in cystine content(~3%) [ 107] and also highly variable in thickness from about 50 to 300 nm withineach cuticle scale [ 107] (see Fig. 1.24).

This stain marker stainsthe high sulfur regions of the cuticle cells, that is the epicuticle, the A-layer and theexocuticle. For additional details on the chemical composition of these threeimportant layers of the cuticle, see Swift and Bews [ 117] and Chap. 2.A portion of the under-membrane of Fig. 1.24 is also epicuticle or “epicuticle-like” matter. The cystine rich proteins of the cuticle are either high sulfur or ultrahigh sulfur proteins. Structurally different, high sulfur and ultra high sulfur proteinsare found in the cortex. See the section entitled Major Protein Fractions of Hair inChap. 2.The cuticle of human hair is a laminar structure similar to the cuticle of wool
ﬁber. Details of the different layers of the cuticle have been described for merinowool and for human hair in these references [ 109,118–121]. Figure 1.24 illustratesthe laminar structure of each cuticle cell. Figure 1.26 illustrates the “initial” view ofthe laminar structure of the cell membrane complex of the cuticle (cuticle-cuticlecell membrane complex) and Fig. 1.27 illustrates the cuticle structure relative to thewhole ﬁber. The cell membrane complex and endocuticle represent vulnerableregions to the chemical and physical interactions of permanent waves, bleaches(including permanent dyes) and to everyday grooming actions. See Chap. 6for amore complete discussion of this subject. Chap. 2contains a more completedescription of the amino acid and protein compositions of the cuticle and itsdifferent component parts.Fig. 1.25 TEM of a cross section of a hair ﬁber treated with silver methenamine, illustrating high

1.7.1.2 Epicuticle and the Hair Fiber SurfaceNegri et al. [ 122] demonstrated that the outer surface of hair ﬁbers consists of about75% of a heavily cross-linked protein and about 25% fatty acid that is predomi-nantly 18-methyl eicosanoic acid. These authors proposed a model wherein thefatty acid layer (lipid layer) is connected to the underlying ﬁbrous protein layerthrough thioester linkages involving the cysteine residues of the underlying epicu-ticle proteins [ 122,123], see Fig. 1.28.Negri et al. [ 123] also demonstrated that alcoholic alkali and chlorine treatmentsremove the fatty acid layer from the cuticle. These scientists concluded that theattachment of 18-methyl eicosanoic acid is through thioester linkages becausechlorine water should not remove this lipid layer if it were attached through anester or amide linkage; however chlorine water will readily cleave thioester bonds.Related layers exist between cortical cells that are unstained with protein stains, but
these are removed by soxhlet extraction with chloroform-methanol. Extraction withthis lipid solvent suggests that covalent attachment is not involved in the complexlipid layers between cortical cells [ 123]. See the section in this chapter entitled, theCell Membrane Complex including the Intercellular Nonkeratin Regions of Hairand Chap. 2on this same subject for a more complete description of the cellmembrane complex.So, the surface of mammalian hairs is covered with a thin covalently bound lipidlayer of 18-methyl eicosanoic acid that is bonded to a proteinaceous cell membranecalled epicuticle [ 124]. Jones and Rivett [ 125] concluded that Sims and XPS“indicate the surface of wool ﬁbers is almost exclusively hydrocarbon” consistingof 18-methyl eicosanoic acid and free lipids (see Chap. 2for details). This proteinmembrane is approximately 13 nm thick [ 114] (see Figs. 1.24,1.25,1.26,1.27). InFig.1.24, the surface cell membrane consists of the epicuticle (proteins) and the 18-
methyl eicosanoic acid which is sometimes called the upper or outer Beta layer.Since the attachment of 18-methyl eicosanoic acid to hair is through thioesterlinkages and the cell membrane protein is cross linked by cystine linkages, themethyl eicosanoic acid must be attached to an ultrahigh sulfur protein.Fig. 1.26 Schematicillustrating cell membranecomplex in animal hairs(Adapted from Fraser et al.[124])48 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
As hair is exposed to repeated washing, drying and rubbing actions and tosunlight, changes occur in these surface layers leading to the formation of sulfurcompounds and acids such as mercaptan, sulﬁnate and sulfonate groups. Theseactions lead to a decrease in the free and bound lipid content of the surface therebyconverting the virgin hair surface from a hydrophobic, entity with little surfacecharge to a more hydrophilic, more polar and more negatively charged surface, seeChap. 2and the discussion in Chap. 6for more details.Fig. 1.27 Schematic diagram illustrating cuticle layers with respect to the whole ﬁber1.7 The Cuticle, Cortex, Medulla and Cell Membrane Complex 49
More than 90 years ago, Allworden [ 126] observed that sacs or bubbles form atthe surface of the ﬁbers during treatment with chlorine water (see Fig. 1.29).Chlorine water diffuses into cuticle cells and attacks thioester linkages removingthe lipid layer from the hair surface. It further degrades the proteins beneath theepicuticle by attacking the disulﬁde bonds cleaving the protein cross links andoxidizing them to higher sulfur acids producing water-soluble species too bulky todiffuse out of the semipermeable membrane. Swelling then results, due to osmoticforces, producing the characteristic Allworden sacs [ 122,127].After removal of the surface lipids, wool ﬁber still undergoes the Allwordenreaction [ 122]. This fact conﬁrms that these surface lipids are attached to the cellmembranes of the cuticle, and furthermore their removal alters but does not destroyFig. 1.28 Schematic illustrating lipid structures in the surface and CMC of the cuticle of hairFig. 1.29 Allworden sacs

the cuticle cell membranes. At this stage the primary integrity of the membrane ismost likely due to the resistant isopeptide cross-links in the cuticle cell membranes.Leeder et al. [ 128] provided evidence that the cell membrane lipids of wool ﬁberdo not consist of phospholipids that normally form bilayers in living tissue. It wassuggested at one time that the epicuticle is a continuous membrane covering onlythe very ﬁber surface [ 129]. However, Leeder and Bradbury [ 100] isolated singlecuticle cells from wool ﬁber and demonstrated that single cuticle cells undergo theAllworden reaction, thus proving that this membrane surrounds each cuticle scale.What has been described as a continuous epicuticle may be cell membrane com-plex, consisting of epicuticle and intercellular binding material that could producethe appearance of a continuous sheath.Of the methods described for isolation of epicuticle, ﬁrst and foremost is the
method by Lindberg et al. [ 129]. This method involves treatment of intact ﬁberswith chlorine water or bromine water followed by neutralization and shaking and isa modiﬁcation of the Allworden reaction. Another method, by Langermalm andPhilip [ 113] involves dissolving the bulk of the ﬁber from the membrane with dilutesodium sulﬁde. Neither of these procedures produces pure epicuticle, but theyprobably provide cell membrane material and part of the underlying A-layer.Swift and Holmes [ 114] described a relatively nondestructive method involvingextraction with hot ethanol for removing some epicuticle material from human hair
ﬁbers. These same scientists concluded that the epicuticle of hair contains both lipidand ﬁbrous protein layers, and is cell membrane material but does not havesufﬁcient contrast with its surroundings to allow microscopic identiﬁcation. Hairﬁbers, when extracted extensively with hot ethanol, are less resistant to enzymaticdegradation than ether-extracted hair and do not undergo the characteristicAllworden reaction with chlorine water. It has been suggested therefore thatextraction of hair with hot ethanol removes either a portion of or degrades theepicuticle membrane sufﬁciently to prevent the Allworden reaction from occurring.Chemical analysis of epicuticle-like substance removed from hair by hot ethanolextraction shows that both protein and fatty acids are present (20–30%) [ 130,131];qualitatively similar results have been reported by Leeder and Bradbury for analysisof epicuticle isolated from merino wool [ 100].
Allworden membranes have been isolated and analyzed quantitatively for aminoacid content by Allen et al. [ 132] who found approximately 21% half-cystine inthese isolated membranes. Additional details of the amino acids and their quantitiesfound by Allen et al. and by others are described in Chap. 2.Zahn et al. [ 133] used Allen’s amino acid data for Allworden membranes andknown compositions of loricrin, involucrin and an ultra high sulfur protein in amultiple regression analysis. This statistical procedure provided indirect evidencefor 51% ultra high sulfur protein, 42% loricrin and 7% involucrin in Allwordenmembranes. Zahn et al. suggested the possibility of a relationship between themembranes of hair and the cellular envelope of skin which also contains loricrinand involucrin. But, more recent evidence by Rogers and Koike [ 134] rules outloricrin and involucrin in the epicuticle suggesting strongly that 18-methyl1.7 The Cuticle, Cortex, Medulla and Cell Membrane Complex 51
eicosanoic acid is attached to an ultrahigh sulfur protein most likely of the KAP 5 or10 types which are cross-linked via cystine and also by isopeptide bonds.Leeder et al. [ 135] deﬁned the epicuticle as a chemically resistant proteinaceousmembrane that remains on keratin ﬁber surfaces after strongly bound lipids havebeen removed with potassium t-butoxide in anhydrous butanol. Thus, the epicuticleis a proteinaceous layer about 130 A ˚thick covered by a strongly bound structurallipid that Leeder called the F layer (18-methyl eicosanoic acid). The F layer is not afrequently used term today, but it represents the outermost lipid layer of the ﬁbersurface.Several different laboratories have analyzed the outer surface of wool andhuman hair via XPS examining the outer 2–3 nm of the hair surface [ 136–139].Ward et al. [ 136] estimated the thickness of the lipid layer of 18-methyl eicosanoicacid at 1 /C60.5 nm. From Carbon/Nitrogen analysis, assuming XPS examines the
top 3 nm, Carr et al. [ 139] estimated 60% protein and 40% lipid in the top 3 nm ofsoxhlet extracted wool. This estimate provides for 36% 18-methyl eicosanoic acid(at 1.1 nm thick) and 4% Free Lipid in the top 3 nm of this wool sample. A similarestimate using data of Robbins and Bahl [ 137] provided 12% free lipid remainingafter shampooing human hair. These data suggest that free lipid is an integral part ofthe surface of hair (most likely between 18-methyl eicosanoic acid molecules) afterand between normal shampooing and hair treatments. See Chap. 2for additionaldetails.Capablanca and Watt [ 140] examined wool ﬁber that had been washed with
detergent and extracted with various solvents using a streaming potential method.These scientists found an appreciable effect of free lipid on the isoelectric pointwith surfactant washed wool having an isoelectric of 3.3 while the most effectivelipid solvent extracted wool provided an isoelectric of 4.5. These data show thatthe true isoelectric point of the surface hair proteins is close to 4.5. Furthermore,free lipid which contains fatty acids is an important and essential component of thesurface of animal hairs, especially for hair in good condition that has only beencleaned with shampoos. Furthermore, the more free lipid (fatty acid) in the surfacelayers, the lower the isoelectric point of the ﬁbers.We know that the surface of hair contains 18-methyl eicosanoic acid attached to
a ﬁbrous ultra high sulfur protein and the source of this surface is the cuticle-cuticlecell membrane complex. Furthermore, we know that the thickness of the upper Betalayer in the cuticle-cuticle cell membrane complex is about 3 nm [ 141–143].However, the thickness of the lipid layer on the surface of wool ﬁber measuredon exhaustively extracted hair by Ward et al. [ 136] using XPS was about 1 nm.Zahn et al. [ 116] proposed a model to explain this smaller than expected thicknessof the MEA in which the surface chains of MEA fold back on themselves. Recently,Natarajan and Robbins [ 144] through computer modeling calculated an MEA layeron a KAP-5 ultra high sulfur protein backbone to be 1.08 nm thick in excellentagreement with the calculations by Ward et al. [ 136].XPS shows that shampooed hair and scoured wool contain more lipid at thesurface than can be accounted for by MEA alone. Furthermore, wool extracted by
different solvents provides different isolectric points suggesting that free fatty52 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
acids/lipids are in the top 3 nm of the hair surface. Therefore it is reasonable toconclude that in the cell membrane complex of the cuticle and in the virgin mostsurface there is free fatty acid in between MEA molecules causing it to stretch out toapproach its full length of about 2.75 nm at an angle of 72/C14and with additionalassumptions provides a lipid layer thickness close to 3 nm, see the section in thischapter entitled Thickness of the Cuticle Beta Layers . This value is in agreementwith the thickness of the upper Beta layer [ 141,142] that ultimately becomes themajor part of the new hair ﬁber surface when hair is deformed and abraded in thedry state [ 107].1.7.2 The Cortex, its Cells, Macroﬁbrils, Matrix andIntermediate FilamentsThe cortex constitutes the major part of the ﬁber mass (70–90%, the lower percent-
age in ﬁne hair) of human hair and consists of cells and intercellular bindingmaterial. The intercellular binding material or the cell membrane complex isdescribed later in this chapter.1.7.2.1 Cortical CellsRandebrock [ 2] found that cortical cells of human hair ﬁbers are generally 1–6 mmthick and approximately 50–100 mm long (see Figs. 1.20 and1.30), althoughconsiderable variation in their size and shape has been reported. Figure 1.30 is anSEM of a split hair with separated cortical cells appearing like splintered wood.Figure 1.31 is a high magniﬁcation image of the same split hair illustrating themacroﬁbrillar structures inside cortical cells. Straight to wavy Caucasian haircontains a more symmetrical cortex, like straight mohair ﬁber, and most (but notall) of the cells are of the same general type with regard to the ratio of ﬁbrillar tononﬁbrillar matter (highly crystalline ¼ﬁbrillar; less organized ¼nonﬁbrillar).
Many wool ﬁbers contain two or even three types of cortical cells that aresometimes segregated into distinct regions (Fig. 1.32) that can be observed incross section [ 145]. These cell types are called orthocortex, paracortex, andmesocortex. Orthocortical cells contain less matrix material between the interme-diate ﬁlaments and lower sulfur content (~3%). Kassenbeck [ 146] indicated thatparacortical cells are smaller in diameter, and they have smooth and roundedborders and higher sulfur content (~5%) [ 146]. Mesocortical cells contain interme-diate cystine content [ 147].Morphologically, the cortical cells of human scalp hair of Caucasians are similarbut not identical to those of wool ﬁber. Kassenbeck [ 146] determined that corticalcells adjacent to the cuticle in human hair are more ﬂat and contain less sulfur thanthe remaining cortical cells that comprise the bulk of the cortex. Kassenbeck calls1.7 The Cuticle, Cortex, Medulla and Cell Membrane Complex 53
these heterotype cortical cells. Leon [ 148] several years ago noted in his review onhair that “Negro” hair contains a higher proportion of orthocortex cells thanCaucasian hair. Swift [ 149] more recently provided evidence on a limited samplingof Nigerian hair for a higher percentage of orthocortical type cells (roughly 50/50para to orthocortex) than in straight hair of Caucasians which he classiﬁed aspredominately paracortex with a small arc (about 1 cell thick) of orthocortex atthe periphery somewhat similar to Kassenbeck’s description of Caucasian hair.Thibaut et al. [ 150] and Bryson et al. [ 151] investigated the different types ofcortical cells and their structures in more detail and identiﬁed different distributionsof different cell types for straight vs. curly hair. Their ﬁndings are summarized inthis chapter in the section entitled The Origin of Hair Fiber Curvature .Kassenbeck [ 146] suggested that the biological function of crimped animal hairs
is to trap large volumes of air in the hair coat to provide thermal insulation. Foranimals with both summer and winter fur: Summer fur—begins to grow rapidly inthe spring, producing long and coarse hairs that are less crimped to inhibit theformation of air pockets and to permit cooling.Fig. 1.30 SEM of a split hair.Note cortical cell fragments54 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
Winter fur—begins to grow in the autumn, yielding short, stiff, crimped hairs totrap large volumes of air in the coat for thermal insulation. Perhaps the seasonaleffect on anagen/telogen ratios for human scalp hair is related to the summer/wintereffects on hair growth in fur bearing animals.Kassenbeck [ 146] further explained that the growth rate of animal hair and themorphological structures of both cuticle and cortex are relevant to the hair shapeand to the cooling and insulation functions. Cortical cells also contain pigmentgranules and nuclear remnants. The nuclear remnants are small, elongated cavitiesnear the center of the cells. The pigment granules are small, oval or sphericalFig. 1.31 Scanning electron micrograph of a split hair showing details of cortical structureFig. 1.32 Schematic of a wool ﬁber, illustrating orthocortex and paracortex regions of the cortexin relation to crimp1.7 The Cuticle, Cortex, Medulla and Cell Membrane Complex 55
particles of approximately 2,000–8,000 A ˚units (0.2–0.8 mm) in “diameter” [ 152]that are dispersed throughout the cortical and medullary cells. Both these structurescomprise only a small fraction of the cortex. Generally, pigment granules do notoccur in the cuticle of scalp hair; however, pigment granules have been observed inthe cuticle and the medulla of beard hair, especially in heavily pigmented hair [ 5].Birbeck and Mercer [ 153] suggested that pigment granules enter the corticalcells by a phagocytosis mechanism in the zone of differentiation and biologicalsynthesis. Piper [ 154] presented evidence that cortical cells are linked to adjacentcuticle cells via complex interlocking structures occurring through a mechanisminvolving phagocytosis (see Fig. 1.33).Cortical cells may be isolated from human hair by procedures involving eithershaking in formic acid [ 100,155], or other solvents (Erhardt H, Private communi-
cation), or enzymatic digestion [ 98,101,102]. Another procedure involves shakinghair ﬁbers in water in the presence of glass beads by Wortmann [ 103] to strip thecuticle cells from the hair to provide cortex with intact cell membranes free ofcuticle. In addition to nuclear remnants and pigment granules, the cortical cells ofhuman hair contain highly important spindle-shaped ﬁbrous structures calledmacroﬁbrils or macroﬁlaments (see Figs. 1.20,1.31 and1.34).1.7.2.2 MacroﬁbrilsRandebrock [ 2] followed up on the pioneering studies of George Rogers on wooland other hair ﬁbers and found that the spindle-shaped macroﬁbrils in human hairare approximately 0.1–0.4 mm in width or diameter. The macroﬁbrils comprise amajor portion of the cortical cells (see Figs. 1.34 and1.35). Each macroﬁbrilconsists of intermediate ﬁlaments originally called microﬁbrils (highly organizedﬁbrillar units) in a matrix, a less organized structure that surrounds the intermediate
Fig. 1.33 Schematic illustrating Piper’s interlocking scheme for linking cuticle to cortex56 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
ﬁlaments. For more details on the intermediate ﬁlament structures see the sectionentitled Intermediate Filaments in this chapter.1.7.2.3 MatrixVarious estimates of the relative quantities of matrix to intermediate ﬁlamentprotein (amorphous to crystalline proteins) have been made for both wool ﬁberand human hair [ 156,157]. Although the relative quantities vary [ 158], the matrix-to-intermediate ﬁlament ratio in human hair is generally greater than 1.0. Proteinderived primarily from matrix (gamma keratose) can be isolated from keratin ﬁbersby the method of Alexander and Earland [ 159]. See Chap. 2in the section entitledFig. 1.34 Scanning electronmicrograph of cortical cells ofa human hair ﬁber. From asplit hairFig. 1.35 Stereogram of a human hair ﬁber including intermediate ﬁlament-matrix structures1.7 The Cuticle, Cortex, Medulla and Cell Membrane Complex 57
Other Protein Fractionation Methods . This method involves oxidation of hair usingperacetic acid followed by alkaline treatment. Analysis of the gamma keratose fromhuman hair indicates a higher proportion of sulfur compared to the other keratosefractions or to whole ﬁber [ 87]. Corﬁeld et al. [ 160] isolated matrix material frommerino wool by this procedure. Chemical analysis gave a relatively high proportionof sulfur and a correspondingly greater proportion of cystine compared to the otherfractions or to whole ﬁber [ 87].Electron microscopy takes advantage of the high cystine content of matrix andthe ability of cystine to react with osmium tetroxide to reveal the ﬁne structure ofhair in the following manner. Reduction of the ﬁbers followed by treatment withosmium tetroxide, prior to sectioning, produces a heavily stained matrix revealingthe relatively unstained intermediate ﬁlaments [ 161].Matrix comprises the largest structural subunit of the cortex of human hair ﬁbers.
It contains the highest concentration of disulﬁde bonds of the cortex and themajority of these are probably intra-chain bonds rather than inter-chain bonds,because the matrix swells considerably when wet with water. Mechanically thematrix resembles a lightly cross-linked gel [ 162] rather than a highly cross-linkedpolymer. Matrix is often referred to as the amorphous region; although evidencesuggests that it does contain some degree of structural organization [ 163].A spacing of 28 A ˚has been demonstrated in mohair matrix. Spei attributed thisspacing to structural repeat units of the matrix [ 164].Proteins of the matrix are sometimes referred to in the literature as keratinassociated proteins (KAP’s) or as inter-ﬁbrillar associated proteins (IFAP). Rogerset al. [ 165] suggested that there are essentially three classes of KAP’s based on
amino acid composition. The high sulfur KAP’s (containing about 20% to about30% cystine), the Ultra high sulfur KAP’s (containing approximately 30% or morecystine and about 20% or more serine) and the KAP 6–8 which are tyrosine/glycinerich KAP’s, see the section entitled The KAP Proteins of Human Hair in Chap. 2formore details about the KAP proteins in human hair.1.7.2.4 Intermediate FilamentsAs indicated above, the macroﬁbrils in human hair contain subﬁlamentousstructures called intermediate ﬁlaments (IF) (formed from intermediate ﬁlamentproteins or keratins) and originally called microﬁbrils (microﬁlaments). Themacroﬁbrils are arranged in spiral formation in the cortical cells. The radius ofeach spiral of the macroﬁbril, is approximately 4,000-A ˚units [ 166], and the widthor diameter of an intermediate ﬁlament is close to 75 A ˚(see Fig. 1.20).Two of the six known Types of IF proteins are in keratin ﬁbers. The exact
organization within the IFs of hair ﬁbers is still being determined, although severalbasic structures were proposed back in the 1980s [ 167,168] and improved uponsince then. The ﬁlamentous polypeptides of human hair ﬁbers are classiﬁed as TypeI and Type II and these differ by their amino acid sequences resulting in acidic(Type I) and neutral to basic (Type II) proteins. Crewther et al. [ 167] in 198358 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
concluded that the IFs contain precise arrays of the low-sulfur proteins, containingshort sections of alpha-helical proteins in coiled coil formation, showing a heptadrepeat unit. The coiled coils are interrupted at three positions by non-helicalfragments and are terminated by non-helical domains at both the nitrogen (N) andcarbon (C) termini of the chain (Fig. 1.36). The individual ﬁlament-like proteinchains of Fig. 1.35 are arranged into coiled coil dimers each containing one strandof type I and a second strand of type II chains (Fig. 1.36). These coiled coil dimersare then coiled around other dimers forming tetramers and higher ordered tubulartype structures with very complex molecular associations head to tail forminglonger ﬁlaments and lateral associations across coils forming complex IF structureswhich ultimately produce the different protein domains of orthocortex, mesocortexand paracortex, etc.
and paracortex, etc.The schematic of Fig. 1.36 shows a general structure for the initial formation ofdimeric units of IF structures. In this schematic, at the end N terminus, E1 is the enddomain, V1 is a variable sequence and H1 is a high sequence region. At the Cterminus, E2 is the end domain, V2 is a variable sequence and H2 is a high sequenceregion. The cystine content, of the low sulfur region of an IF is about 6%. It is notuniformly dispersed between domains of an IF chain. The rod domain containsabout only 3% half-cystine, which is about one half-cystine residue, while the Nterminal domain contains about 11% half-cystine and the C terminal unit aboutFig. 1.36 Schematic illustrating the structure of an intermediate ﬁlament protein (type I-type IIdimer). E are the end domains (E2 the C terminus and E1 the N terminus), V a variable sequenceregion and H is a high sequence region1.7 The Cuticle, Cortex, Medulla and Cell Membrane Complex 59
17% half-cystine. Fraser [ 168,169] suggested that these half-cystine residues areinvolved in disulﬁde linkages and that most of the disulﬁde residues exist in thematrix rather than in the IFs.These dimeric units aggregate in an anti-parallel arrangement to form structuralunits composed of four protein chains or tetramers [ 167,168]. Tetramers areconnected end to end forming subﬁlaments called protoﬁlaments which interacttogether to form the IFs of the cortex. Seven to ten of these tetramer units arebelieved to combine or aggregate into a larger helical structure, forming the IFs ofthe cortex of animal hairs. It would appear that the most favored structure is still theone proposed by R.D.B. Fraser et al. [ 168] in the 1980s. Fraser’s concept contains atotal of 8 protoﬁlaments and consists of a single core protoﬁlament surrounded byseven protoﬁlaments [ 168]. For a more complete discussion of IF structures of
keratin ﬁbers, see the paper by ErRaﬁk, Doucet and Briki on IFs of human hair[170], the paper by Powell and Rogers [ 89] and the references by Langbein and M.A. Rogers et al. in this chapter including [ 171,172] and the papers by R.D. BruceFraser [ 173] and R.D.B. Fraser [ 174].Langbein and M.A. Rogers et al. [ 171] reported that there are nine members inthe human Type I subfamily that can be divided into three groups where H ¼hair,a¼acidic, b ¼basic, and the number corresponds to a two dimensional stainingspot. The names in parentheses are newer names as summarized in Table 1.16.Group A: hHa1 (K31), hHa3-I (K33a), hHa3-II (K33b), hHa4 (K34) and Group B:hHa7 (K37), hHa8 (K38) and Group C: hHa2 (K32), hHa5 (K35), hHa6 (K36). Thislatter group represents structurally unrelated hair keratins.

[ 172] described that the Type II keratin subfamily contains six membersdivided into two groups and designated as: Group A: hHb1 (K81), hHb3 (K83),hHb6 (K86) which are structurally related and Group C: hHb2 (K82), hHb4 (K84)and hHb5 (K85) which are distinct. The sequence in which these keratins areexpressed in the follicle is also described by Langbein and Rogers et al. in thesepapers. For additional details on these important hair proteins see Chap. 2in thesection entitled Type I and II Keratin Proteins (IF Proteins) of Human Hair andreferences [ 168–174].1.7.2.5 Helical Proteins of the Intermediate FilamentsThe subunits that constitute the IFs of hair ﬁbers are polypeptide chains of proteinssee Fig. 1.36 that are combined together as described in the section above. Thecoiled sections or the helical domains of these protein chains are approximately10 A˚in diameter, including side chains, and are believed to approximate the form of
an alpha helix, ﬁrst proposed by Pauling and Corey [ 175–177] (see Figs. 1.37 and1.38).Pauling and Corey proposed the alpha helix from the x-ray diffraction analysisof keratin ﬁbers pioneered by Astbury et al. [ 178–180] and MacArthur [ 181,182].Wide-angle x-ray diffractions (up to approximately 15 A ˚repeating units) of un-stretched human hair and other keratin ﬁbers (wool and porcupine quill) showseveral related spacings, among which are an equatorial spacing (perpendicular toFig. 1.37 Structure of an alpha-helix proposed by Pauling and Corey1.7 The Cuticle, Cortex, Medulla and Cell Membrane Complex 61
the ﬁber axis) of 9.8 A ˚and meridional spacings (parallel to the ﬁber axis) of 5.1 and1.5 A˚(see Figs. 1.37 and1.38).Pauling and Corey interpreted the 1.5-A ˚spacing to represent the distancebetween each amino acid residue. The 5.1-A ˚spacing was assigned the repeatdistance for coiling; corresponding to 3.6 amino acid residues and the 9.8-A ˚spacingrepresented the center-to-center distance between each alpha helix. This latterspacing approximates the thickness of the alpha helix. A linear polypeptide alphahelix would have a repeat distance of 5.4-A ˚units. Therefore, coiling of each helix[183] was proposed to account for the shorter 5.1 meridional spacing. Furthermore,it was originally suggested that two- or three-strands of polypeptides were coiledabout each other analogous to a twisted rope [ 184–186]. This structure has been
routinely referred to as the “coiled coil” model. The model that is now accepted foranimal hairs is the two-strand rope polypeptide described in the previous sectionentitled, The Intermediate Filaments .Fig. 1.38 Molecular modelof a left-hand helix ofpolyalanine. A right-handhelix (spiraling in the otherdirection) is the pattern foundin most proteins, includinganimal hairs (see Fig. 1.37)62 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
1.8 Stretching Hair and Stress Strain ModelsStretching hair can produce splits or cracks in the endocuticle and the cell mem-brane complex. Transverse cracks also occur in the cuticle layers as well as damageto the cortex. Nevertheless prior to this past decade, most of the scientiﬁc attentionrelating to stretching hair has been concerned with cortical effects; see Chaps. 6and9for details related to damaging effects by stretching hair.Astbury [ 179] found that water produces negligible effects to the wide-anglex-ray diagram of keratin ﬁbers. However, extension in water diminishes theintensities of the reﬂections corresponding to the ahelix and produces a patterncalled bkeratin represented by a 3.3-A ˚reﬂection along the ﬁber axis (the Z axis inFig.1.39), a 4.65-A ˚reﬂection at right angles to the Z axis (along the Y axis), and a9.8-A˚reﬂection at right angles to the Z axis (along the X axis) [ 167]. The molecular
model of Fig. 1.40 describes the interpretation of these reﬂections in terms ofmolecular structure. Most explanations of this phenomenon invoke an atobtransformation, that is the transformation of molecules of the a-helical structureinto the pleated sheet arrangement of the bstructure.To explain the stretching behavior of hair, many scientists consider hairconsisting of only two components, IFs and matrix; however, to explain the fracturebehavior of hair we must also involve the cell membrane complex. Some swellingmodels also consider only the intermediate ﬁlaments and matrix; however, Swift[187] provided some consideration to the non-keratin components for explainingthe swelling behavior of keratin ﬁbers. See the next section entitled SwellingBehavior of Hair.Fig. 1.39 Portions of two polypeptide chains in the beta conﬁguration. The cylinder represents ahair ﬁber, and the axis identiﬁes the orientation of the proteins in the ﬁber. See corresponding
molecular models in Fig. 1.401.8 Stretching Hair and Stress Strain Models 63
To reﬁne our understanding of the mechanical properties of keratin ﬁbers,models involving the intermediate ﬁlament-matrix level of structural organizationhave been employed by Feughelman [ 188–190], Bendit [ 191], Hearle [ 192],Chapman [ 193], Wortmann and Zahn [ 194], and Kreplak et al. [ 195] and others.Only three of these models will be described along with some more recent relevantwork.1.8.1 Feughelman’s Two Phase ModelFeughelman [ 189,196] nearly 50 years ago proposed a two phase model in thecortex of animal hairs involving a relationship between mechanical properties andmolecular conﬁguration. At about the same time, Bendit [ 191] considered the atobtransformation to explain part of the stress strain curve of animal hairs.Feughelman’s two phase model [ 188] consisted of water-impenetrable rods (IFs)oriented parallel with the ﬁber axis embedded in a water-penetrable matrix. Thistwo-phase model is useful for helping to explain the mechanical properties of virgin
keratin ﬁbers including extension, bending, and torsional properties and also theswelling behavior of unmodiﬁed keratins. Feughelman explained the initial part ofthe stress strain curve, which is the “Hookean” region, by suggesting that the alphahelices of the IFs are strained, and hydrogen bonds of the globular proteins of thematrix are involved. Feughelman suggested that upon further extension into theFig. 1.40 Molecular modelof two polyalanine chains inthe beta conﬁguration64 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
yield and postyield regions, the atobtransformation occurs in the coiled proteinsof the IFs producing a loss of helical structure, which is recovered on relaxation.Feughelman’s model explained that the globular proteins of the matrix act inparallel with the IFs. The matrix phase is weakened by the presence of water. On theother hand, the crystalline regions of the IFs are virtually inert to water over theentire load-extension curve. In 1994, Feughelman modiﬁed and updated his modelto what is called an X/Y zones model [ 190]. For additional details of the extensionbehavior of keratin ﬁbers see the remaining discussion in this Chapter and Chap. 9and for effects of extension on the cuticle see Chaps. 6and9.1.8.2 Wortmann and Zahn’s ModelWortmann and Zahn [ 194] in 1994, proposed a different model placing more
emphasis on the structures of the IFs and less emphasis on the matrix which theyconsidered a gel to sol system. These scientists suggested that the opening up of twodifferent parts of the IF monomer is responsible for the yield and post yield parts ofthe stress strain curve. Furthermore the increased slope in the post yield area is dueto the sulfur bonds in one of the monomer segments of the IFs and that disulﬁde-sulfhydryl interchange occurs in the post yield region.This model by Wortmann and Zahn [ 194] does seem to address many of theconcerns of others [ 195,197,198]. For example, Wortmann and Zahn calculatedthat about 20% of ahelices have opened up at the end of the yield region [ 27,31].Furthermore, they suggested that 48–56% of the ahelical material has beenconverted to bsegments upon the breaking stress in water (60–70%) strain. Thesecalculations by Wortmann and Zahn are consistent with the ﬁndings of Kreplak[195].
The structural model by Wortmann and Zahn [ 194] places less emphasis on thematrix proteins and explains the ﬁber tensile behavior in terms of the molecularstructure of the IFs and bonding within and to these important structures. Thismodel suggests that the yield region arises by the a-helical chains uncoiling becausethey are not restricted by disulﬁde bonds. In this model the post yield region occursin the domains restricted by disulﬁde bonding and the disulﬁde bonds continue toinhibit stretching until the ﬁber breaks. However, even this model fails to explainthe stress.strain behavior of chemically oxidized or sun oxidized keratin ﬁbers.1.8.3 Other Models/Modiﬁcations and Some ConcernsMore recently, slight modiﬁcations or neuances to the above models (or a newmodel as suggested by the authors) were proposed by Kreplak et al. [ 195] withsupporting evidence by small-angle x-ray scattering on stretched a-keratin ﬁbers.
Interpretation of the data of these scientists suggested that the mechanical stretching1.8 Stretching Hair and Stress Strain Models 65
of hair ﬁbers involves both stretching and sliding of keratin molecules inside theIFs. Furthermore, the water content of the ﬁbers determines the relative importanceof sliding vs. stretching. For example, when stretching hair ﬁbers in water, themolecular sliding process is dominant up to about 40% strain where it is believedthat stretching becomes more important. However, at 45% RH both stretching andsliding occur and the end result is unfolding of the a-helices to b-sheets asoriginally proposed by Bendit [ 191].Two papers by Cao [ 197,198] provided additional information to consider withrespect to these structural models. In the ﬁrst paper, Cao [ 197] emphasized that theassumption of a one to one micro.macro (molecular to ﬁber) relationship has beenmade by most structural models for explaining the stress.strain behavior of keratinﬁbers. Cao suggested that the macroscopic 40% extension of the ﬁber is not actually
matched by 40% extension of polypeptide chains throughout the ﬁber, but inter-molecular slippage can occur that can cause rearrangement of the lattice structure.Cao examined hair and wool ﬁber using x-ray analysis examining the 5.1meridional fraction characteristic of the a-form and the 4.65 equatorial diffractioncharacteristic of the b-form. Cao concluded that a 40% stretch of wet hair that isheld at 40% elongation does not display any evidence of a b-form, but only a-formcrystallites, however the same 40% stretch followed by steam setting for 20 minshows a b-form crystalline pattern. So, Cao concluded that the atobtransitionoccurs only while a stretched hair or wool ﬁber is being set using steam, not while itis being stretched. To my knowledge no one in this ﬁeld has either addressed, foundor reproduced this ﬁnding by Cao.In Cao’s second paper on this subject [ 198], he demonstrated irregular multiple
necking or narrowing deformations along the length of the hairs rather than acontinuously uniform elongation along the length of the ﬁbers. Cao drew ananalogy to the same phenomenon that occurs in the stretching of syntheticpolymers. X-ray analysis showed b-crystallinity in the necked sections anda-crystallinity in the non-deformed un-necked sections of the ﬁbers. Furthermore,the greater the percentage of stretching the more b-crystalline form resulted.Kreplak et al. [ 199] in a more recent publication sheds additional light on thestretching behavior of horse hair ﬁbers. These scientists showed by wide anglex-ray scattering and high spatial resolution infrared microspectroscopy that the atobtransformation occurs near 20% strain for wet hair and not before. This is close tothe end of the yield region, not near the beginning such as 5% strain as suggested byearlier investigators. The data is consistent with the unfolding of ahelical coiled
coils below 20% but not transitioning to the bconﬁrmation until above 20% strain.Kreplak et al. [ 199] also suggested that their data is consistent with the atobtransition occurring from 20% to 50% strain and that the transformation occurs ﬁrstin the ﬁber core and then moves slowly to the ﬁber periphery. They suggested thatthis transition from the ﬁber core to the periphery is related to differences incrystallinity (the IFs) in the ﬁber core vs. the periphery.These experiments by Kerplak et al. were with horse hair, a very straight hairﬁber. But we know that there are different crystalline distributions between straighthair and highly coiled hair ﬁbers. For example, both straight human hair and wool66 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
ﬁber have been shown to possess an annular type cortex with para type cortical cellsin the core, meso type cells in between and orthocortical type cells at the peripheryof the cortex [ 150,151]. On the other hand, highly curled hairs have been shown tocontain a bilateral type cortex with more para type cells in the concave side of thecurl and ortho type cells in the convex side. Therefore, with Kreplak’s model,I would anticipate that stretching straight hairs of all types would originate ﬁrst inthe core and move to the periphery as found by Kerplak et al. [ 199]. However, forhighly curled hairs, I would conclude that the alpha to beta transition would ﬁrstbegin in the most concave side of curls and then move to the other side.1.8.4 Fractographic and Damaged Hair Concerns withThese ModelsTo explain the load elongation behavior of the most virgin parts of the ﬁbers these
models appear to be reasonably sufﬁcient. However, to explain load elongationbehavior up to and including catastrophic failure for certain types of hair damage,these models do not explain fractographic results and consequences of certain typesof hair ﬁber damage. For example, as hair is damaged especially by free radicaloxidative treatments fractures are propagated along the axis through the cellmembrane complex [ 200,201] and the medulla [ 200] providing step fractures,ﬁbrillated ends and split hairs [ 200,201]. Feughelman [ 202] in his book explainedthat the stronger cortical cells dominate the bulk properties of the cortex until theCMC fails. He stated further that the CMC does not have “any effect on themeasurement of the mechanical properties of the cortex until failure isapproached.” Furthermore, he did not describe any instances where damage occursto the CMC or produces effects on the mechanical properties.
Fractures can occur in the CMC before catastrophic failure in hair ﬁbers on liveheads with sunlight exposure and/or normal oxidative cosmetic treatments and onAfrican hair with twists. I arranged with a local hair dresser to collect hair clippingsfrom a few of his selected customers; those he believed to have split hairs. Aquestionnaire was devised and completed by the hair dresser in collaboration withthe customer on the type of hair and the different treatments and conditions that thehair had been exposed to. Hair cuttings were collected from eight femaleCaucasians. Prior to cutting, all hair samples measured approximately 35–55 cmlong and the amount of hair cuttings varied from a total of 2–12 g. A total of 272
split hairs were found and classiﬁed into six different types of splits. The highestfrequency and most severe splits were from four panelists who frequently treated orexposed their hair to peroxide-persulfate or to two or more of these products/exposures known to involve free radicals: peroxide-persulfate, sun bathing, oxida-tion dyes and hot irons (straightening or curling). From these hairs, several exampleswere found indicative of CMC fracturing before catastrophic failure. Two of these1.8 Stretching Hair and Stress Strain Models 67
examples will be described and several are illustrated in Chap. 10in the sectionentitled, Split Ends, Types, and their Occurrence & Formation :– Split hairs NOT Split ends. This type of split can occur as far as 4 cm from the tipend, and it occurs before catastrophic failure.– Broom type effects resulting from fractures in the CMC several cm from the tipend. This effect is caused by oxidative cosmetic damage and grooming actionsand is analogous to the fractures at the nodes of the hair abnormality intrichorrhexis nodosa. This type of effect occurs before catastrophic failure.
These effects illustrate that fractures can occur in the CMC before catastrophicfailure and they should produce changes in the tensile curves in some cases priorto the post yield region. However, if such effects are observed in testing, the datacould lead to premature failure for some ﬁbers and will often be omitted asoutliers. So, hairs that have been exposed to free radical cosmetics and/orsunlight and taken directly from live heads can have extensive damage to theCMC. Therefore, I conclude that hairs treated similarly but fractured lessextensively in the CMC should produce some detectable changes in theirmechanical behavior prior to catastrophic failure.Kamath and Weigmann [ 200] determined that more smooth fractures are formedthan axial fractures at high humidity or in the wet state. Furthermore, at highhumidity or the wet state crack initiation tends to be near the cuticle-cortexboundary, and then the crack propagates toward the center of the cortex [ 200].
Kamath and Weigmann concluded that when the hair is wet or at high humidity theswelling pressure of the cortex on the cuticle is involved in crack initiation. Inaddition, more axial splitting was obtained from hair ﬁbers in which the cuticle hadbeen damaged and partially removed by abrasion than non-abraded hair permittingKamath and Weigmann to conclude that a strong intact cuticle inhibits axialsplitting of hair ﬁbers [ 6].Robbins [ 203] in his review of the CMC described its sensitivity to free radicalreactions as demonstrated for both human hair and wool ﬁber and that this sensitiv-ity leads to an increase in step fractures, split hairs and ﬁbrillated ends.Brown and Swift [ 201] tested root sections and weathered tips of long (morethan 50 cm) human hair ﬁbers from six Caucasian females in a tensile tester at roomhumidity and temperature. These scientists observed more smooth fractures in theroot sections and more longitudinal and circumferential splitting (axial fracturing)
in the more weathered tip ends.The stress.strain models (described above) do explain load elongation in theHookean and yield regions for virgin hair, but they are less effective in the postyield region particularly in damaged hair when fractographic studies and otherevidence suggest that the CMC is involved [ 200,201].For example, undamaged virgin hair roots generally provides a smooth fracturein water, usually beginning near the cuticle-cortex boundary [ 200] (in the post yieldregion) and it continues across cortical proteins and appears to be consistent withthe stress.strain models. However, for sun damaged hair or highly weathered tipends, the CMC can be sufﬁciently damaged primarily by free radical oxidation to68 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
weaken the cortex CMC [ 203] and with it the cell membrane proteins; so axialfracturing occurs and the CMC is involved.In this case, a fracture may begin in the cortical proteins in the post yield regionas suggested by either the Feughelman model (in the amorphous proteins) or theWortmann-Zahn model (in the intermediate ﬁlaments). After the crack haspropagated to where it encounters the weakened cell membrane complex it isdiverted and propagated through the CMC and the medulla (if present) and thendiverts once again to another region of the cortical proteins to provide a stepfracture. On the other hand, if the CMC is extensively damaged, once the crackﬁrst diverts into the CMC it can spread in the CMC to provide a split hair or aﬁbrillated end depending on how badly the CMC has been damaged. So, to explainthe stress.strain behavior of these types of damaged hair ﬁbers the intercellularregions of the hair ﬁber must also be involved.
regions of the hair ﬁber must also be involved.If we have a hypothesis or a model that explains the tensile properties of undam-aged virgin hair, but it does not explain the stress.strain behavior of many commontypes of hair damage or even damage to the weathered tip ends of hair and Africantype hair, it is of limited value. So, to increase the value of these models they shouldbe extended to explain common forms of hair damage in addition to simplyexplaining undamaged virgin hair. It would appear that the weakest links in “virgin”hair ﬁbers to tensile extension are the structures inside cortical cells. However, with
most types of hair damage, as strain or extension continues to higher levels, fracturingextends to and involves the cell membrane complex by forming step fractures,ﬁbrillated ends or split hairs. Furthermore for catastrophic failure that forms a stepfracture to occur a crack inside a cortical cell must extend across and axially throughthe CMC. Therefore the CMC must be involved in any hypothesis or model to fullyexplain the tensile properties of hair especially when considering damaged hair ﬁbers.I conclude with Hearle [ 192] that we need a better understanding of the molecu-lar organization of what is called the “amorphous” matrix and the keratin associatedproteins to better understand the mechanical properties of hair and wool ﬁber. But,in addition we need a better understanding of the molecular organization of the cellmembrane complex too.1.9 Swelling Behavior of Hair
1.9 Swelling Behavior of HairThe organizational level believed to control the swelling behavior of keratins is thesecondary and tertiary structure of the IFs and the matrix [ 204]. As indicatedpreviously, the IFs consist of proteins containing alpha-helical segments embeddedin the less organized matrix of high cystine content.In keratin ﬁbers like human hair and wool ﬁber, the helical proteins of the IFs areoriented parallel with the axis of the ﬁber (see Fig. 1.41). The IFs help to maintainthe structural integrity of the ﬁbers while most of the volume swelling takes place inthe matrix proteins [ 204,205]. This is consistent with Feughelman’s [ 188] two-phase model of water-impenetrable rods (IFs) in a water-penetrable matrix. As a1.9 Swelling Behavior of Hair 69
result, maximum swelling occurs between the IFs and minimum swelling occursalong the axis of the IFs. Therefore, maximum swelling occurs in the diametraldimension of hair, and minimum swelling occurs in the longitudinal dimension thatis along the axis of the ﬁbers (see Fig. 1.41). For example, Stam et al. [ 206] hasshown that from 0% to 100% relative humidity, hair increases nearly 14% indiameter, but less than 2% in length. Other reagents such as sodium lauryl sulfate,formic acid, and thioglycolic acid produce more swelling than water but dimen-sionally they swell hair similarly; that is they produce greater swelling in thediametral dimension than in the ﬁber length [ 204].Swift [ 187] and others suggested that the non-keratin portions of hair are also
important to ﬁber swelling. For example, Swift demonstrated by the penetration ofﬂuorescent labelled proteins in water that a large order swelling occurs in the non-keratin regions of hair. The diametral swelling of hair by water from the dry state isabout 14% to 16%. On the other hand, Spei and Zahn [ 207] using x-ray diffractionmeasurement of inter-IF separation distances indicates that swelling of only 5.5%occurs. Swift, therefore, proposed that part of the difference can be explained byswelling that occurs in the non-keratin regions of the cuticle and the cortex. Foradditional details on swelling of human hair, see Chap. 9.Protein from the IFs of human hair can be isolated by oxidation with peraceticacid according to the method of Alexander and Earland [ 159]. One fractionobtained by this procedure is called alpha keratose. See Chap. 2in the section
entitled Other Protein Fractionation Methods. The alpha keratose fraction amountsto about 45% of the ﬁber mass, containing a substantially lower proportion of sulfurthan the other two keratose fractions (see Table 2.16). The low sulfur contentsuggests a relatively low proportion of the amino acid cystine in the IFs andtherefore a low proportion of cystine in the alpha-helical proteins. This conclusionFig. 1.41 Schematic illustrating the directional swelling of human hair70 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
is consistent with the amino acid analysis of alpha keratose isolated from merinowool by Corﬁeld et al. [ 160], showing a relatively low percentage of cystine and ahigh percentage of the other bulky amino acids. This keratose fraction is in allprobability not purely IF in origin and likewise not pure alpha-helical protein.However, the fact that it can produce an x-ray pattern similar to that of alphakeratin [ 159], and the other two-keratose fractions cannot, suggest that its origin isthe IFs.1.10 The Origin of Hair Fiber CurvatureWe frequently refer to hair ﬁbers as being round, however most hair ﬁbers areactually oval shaped. In addition, many hairs defy a single word or measurement fortheir cross-sectional shape because they are often twisted and indented with veryirregular cross-section and surface appearances; see Chap. 9for a more completediscussion of hair ﬁber shape including illustrative micrographs of hair ﬁbers.
More than 40 years ago, Mercer [ 208] proposed that the shape of hair ﬁbers isdetermined by the shape of the hair follicles in the zone of keratinization. Lindelofet al. [ 209] concluded from 3-D computer-aided reconstruction of serial sections ofhuman hair follicles from ten patients of three biological races that the shape of thefollicle is a primary factor in determining the ﬁnal hair form or shape. For example,Lindelof et al. reported that the African follicle had a helical form, while the Asianfollicle was essentially straight and the follicle of Caucasians varied between thesetwo extremes.Orwin [ 210] found that breeds of sheep that bear ﬁne-wool tend to have follicles
of narrower diameters and longer follicles correlate with longer wool ﬁbers. Thesefacts suggest that the size and shape of the follicle could play a role in the ﬁnalshape of hair ﬁbers and that the growing ﬁber takes the shape of the mold wherehardening or keratinization occurs. Thus, if the follicle or sac that the ﬁber isformed in is highly curved in the zone of keratinization, the emerging hair ﬁbershould be highly curled, but, if the follicle is relatively straight, the emerging hairwill be straight. This mechanism to explain hair ﬁber curvature is analogous to theshape that is formed for an extruded monoﬁlament for synthetic polymers.An alternative explanation considers the bilateral structure of some keratin ﬁbers
like wool. A helical ﬁber will arise if opposite halves of the ﬁber grow at differentrates or if opposite halves contract to different extents during drying or withmoisture changes. This conclusion is analogous to the way a bilateral thermostatbends with changes in temperature and considers protein composition and distribu-tion as important factors for ﬁber shape.In the 1950s Mercer [ 211] and Rogers [ 212] independently identiﬁed two typesof cortical cells in merino wool ﬁbers. These two types of cells were namedorthocortex and paracortex (see Fig. 1.32). Later, Kaplin and Whiteley [ 213]were able to distinguish between three different types of cortical cells in high-crimp and low-crimp merino wool. Cells on one side of the cross section contained1.10 The Origin of Hair Fiber Curvature 71
whorls of IFs. These were called orthocortical cells, while the names paracorticalcells and mesocortical cells were used for those cells without whorls of microﬁbrilsthat were arranged opposite to the orthocortical cells in wool ﬁbers of high crimpand low crimp, respectively [ 214,215].Highly crimped wool ﬁbers like merino wool, camel, vicuna and guanaco hairhave all been shown to contain bilateral cortical structures with nearly an equalamount of ortho-cortical and para-cortical cells [ 215,216]. On the other hand, non-bilateral structures have been described for relatively straight animal hairs such asmohair and alpaca [ 215].In 1972 Leon [ 148] described both orthocortical and paracortical cells for Negrohair with a “higher proportion of ortho type cortical cells than for Caucasian hair”.Swift [ 149] more recently reported that highly twisted hair from a Black man from
Nigeria was asymmetrically divided and contained about 50% paracortical and 50%orthocortical cells. On the other hand, straight hair from Japanese contained onlypara-cortical cells and thus did not contain bilateral structures of ortho andparacortical cells. For curly Caucasian hair, Swift observed mostly paracortexwith a layer of only one cell thickness of orthocortical cells at the periphery ofthe cortex, but not a bilateral structure.Horio and Kondo [ 217] found in ﬁne high crimp wool ﬁbers that the bilateralarrangement of ortho- and paracortical cells occurs with the orthocortex on theoutside of the curve or curl and the paracortex on the inside of the curl. Thisarrangement was conﬁrmed by Fraser and Rogers [ 218].Campbell et al. [ 219] described the effects of diet on the shape of wool ﬁbers.
Campbell worked with two types of sheep, sheep that provided high crimp wool andsheep that provided low crimp wool. These scientists demonstrated that when bothgroups of sheep were placed on a low nutrition diet, the number of crimps/cm ofwool increased see Table 1.17. However, when these same sheep were placed backon the normal nutrition diet the number of crimps/cm of wool decreased once againsee Table 1.17.Campbell explained these results by suggesting that wool ﬁbers produced on alow nutrition level moves more slowly through the follicle than ﬁbers produced at anormal nutrition level. Furthermore, curved follicles with a faster growth rateshould move the soft unhardened ﬁber through the zone of keratinization fasterand the faster the ﬁber moves through the zone of hardening the fewer crimpsproduced. But, an alternative explanation is that on a low nutrition diet sheep arenot capable of producing the required amount of the speciﬁc proteins that are

necessary for producing the required bilateral content for a high degree of crimpand curl, i.e., speciﬁc IF or KAP proteins. Note, the percentage of high sulfurproteins also decreased and increased with the crimp, see Table 1.17. This effect ofproducing less high sulfur proteins would produce a lower paracortical cell contentresulting in less bilateral content and therefore less crimp or curl.1.10.1 Structures in the Cortex Associated with Curvature
The cortical cells of human hair are composed of ﬁbrillar components calledmacroﬁbrils that are connected by inter-macroﬁbrillar material, cytoplasmic rem-nant and melanin granules. The macroﬁbrils consist primarily of ﬁlamentousproteins that form IF’s that are held together laterally and in orientation byamorphous type proteins called keratin associated proteins (KAP’s). It has beenshown that the distribution of different cortical cell types with their correspondingIF arrangements are related to hair ﬁber curvature in wool, camel, alpaca andmohair ﬁber [ 215–217] and in human hair ﬁbers [ 150,151].Thibaut and coworkers [ 150] studied hair from six persons of Caucasian, NorthAfrican and African descent. This hair was described as straight (Curl type I), wavy(Curl type II or III) and curly human hair (Curl types IV–VII). These STAM(Chap. 9) curvature types are based on my estimates from the photographs in the
Thibaut et al. paper. Thibaut et al. found evidence for three types of cells in thecortex of these hairs. These scientists indicated that the cell types were similar to theorthocortical, mesocortical and paracortical cells found in wool ﬁber [ 217,218,220,221]. In straight hairs, a core of paracortical type cells were generallysurrounded by mesocortical and orthocortical type cells in an annular typearrangement.The amount of mesocortical type cells decreased with increasing ﬁber curvature.Only orthocortical and paracortical type cells were identiﬁed in tightly coiledAfrican hair and these were distributed asymmetrically with the orthocorticaltype cells predominately on the convex side of the curl and the paracortical typecells on the concave side, see Figs. 1.32 and1.42.Fig. 1.42 Schematic of astraight and a curled hairillustrating orthocortex typeand paracortex typedistributions in the ﬁber1.10 The Origin of Hair Fiber Curvature 73
Thibaut et al. [ 150] indicated that the distribution of the keratin protein hHa8(a building block of speciﬁc IF’s) was found to be associated with the amount ofcurliness. As the degree of curvature increased the amount of hHa8 keratinaccumulated more to the concave side of the curl. In tightly curled hair it wasalmost exclusively on the concave side along the length of the ﬁber [ 150]. SincehHa8 keratin is a component of IF protein and its location in the ﬁber cross-sectionis curvature dependent one can conclude that the organization and likely theorientation of the IFs are most likely related to hair ﬁber curvature.Kajiura et al. [ 222] studied a wide range of hair ﬁber curvatures (Curl types I, III,IV, and V–VIII, which I classiﬁed from the curl radii provided) of human hair(African American, Asian and Caucasian) and wool ﬁber by small angle x-rayscattering (SAXS). These scientists found that the gap between IFs is larger on the
concave side of a curl in human hair and smaller on the convex side. This suggestsmore matrix material between IFs on the concave side of a curl in human hair and isconsistent with the observation in wool ﬁber of more paracortex (more matrixmaterial than orthocortex) on the concave side of a curl or curve and moreorthocortex on the convex side of a curl [ 218,221], see Table 1.18 and Figs. 1.32and1.42.Bryson et al. [ 151] examined hair ﬁber curvatures from Curl type I, III and IV ofJapanese hair (I calculated STAM Curl types from curl diameters in that paper) andthey described four different types of cortical cells. These scientists labeled thesecell types as A, B, C and D and found all four cell types in straight and curved hairs.The cells were more symmetrically distributed in straight hairs consisting mainly ofannular bands of cell types around the center of the ﬁber analogous to thearrangements in straight Caucasian and Asian type hair [ 150].
Curved hairs (Curl type IV) in ﬂuorescent stained and TEM hair sections showedstrong bilateral symmetry with respect to the distribution of cell types with mainlyB type cells and some C or D type on the convex side and primarily C type with aTable 1.18 Some properties of orthcortical and paracortical type cells in keratin ﬁbersOrthocortical B or Dacells Paracortical and CacellsOn convex side of curl [ 151,212,218] On concave side of curl [ 212,218]Lower: Matrix/IF’s [ 222–224] Higher: Matrix/IF’s [ 222–224]More crystalline Less crystallineIF’s: Helical whorl-like [ 151,220] IF’s: Parallel arrays [ 220]bLess cystine rich proteins [ 225][228]cfewer cross-linksMore cystine rich proteins [ 225][228]cmore cross-linksLower sulfur content [ 227] Higher sulfur content [ 227]Acidic: Binds more Cationic dyes Basic: Binds more anionic dyesMore extensible and ﬂexible [ 151] Less extensible and ﬂexible [ 151]Lower water binding (all RH’s)dHigher water binding (all RH’s)d

few B type cells on the concave side similar to the ﬁndings of Thibaut et al. [ 150]who called the cells types ortho-, meso-, and paracortical types.Table 1.18 describes some important properties of orthocortical and paracorticalcells in wool ﬁber. These properties are assumed to generally (but not entirely)correspond to the properties of B type and C type cortical cells in human hairrespectively.Bryson et al. [ 151] suggested that the cortical cell types of wool ﬁber are easierto differentiate and are more distinctly separated bilaterally than in high curvatureJapanese hair. These scientists [ 151] also suggested that type B cells of human hairare similar but not exactly the same structurally to orthocortical cells of wool ﬁbersee Table 1.18. The macroﬁbrils of type B cells contain “helical/whorl-like IFarrangements” similar to orthocortical cells [ 151]. Type C cells although similar
structurally to paracortical cells of wool ﬁber are more of a hybrid betweenorthocortical and paracortical cells with respect to their arrangement of IF’s[151]. The macroﬁbrils of type C cells contain IF’s in both “helical/whorl-like”arrangements and “parallel arrays” [ 151].The type B cells of Japanese hair [ 151] and orthocortical cells of wool ﬁber [ 212,218] are primarily in the convex side of ﬁber curls while the type C cells of Japanesehair [ 151] and paracortical cells in wool ﬁber [ 212,218] are largely in the concaveside of curls. The orthocortical cells [ 223,224] and the B cells (on the convex sideof curls) contain more IF material [ 151,223,224], less matrix [ 151,224,226] and alower cross-link density [ 225] and therefore are believed to be more ﬂexible andmore extensible than paracortical cells [ 151] or C type cells [ 151] on the concaveside of curls.Bryson et al. [ 151] suggested when hair or wool ﬁber is wet with water and dries
out the convex ﬁber side (less cystine, therefore more extensible and ﬂexible)should extend more longitudinally than the concave ﬁber side causing the ﬁber tobend toward the region of highest type C cell or paracortical cell concentration.This suggestion is consistent with the cystine composition of these different celltypes, see Table 1.18.Thibaut et al. in another publication [ 228] provided an explanation for this typeof asymmetric cell production and growth by demonstrating that in curly follicles,both the outer root sheath (ORS) and the connective tissue sheath lack symmetryalong the follicle. Where the follicle is convex, the ORS is not as thick and the rateof differentiation by the inner root sheath is decreased. Therefore, these scientistsconcluded that an asymmetric distribution of proteins in curved hair follicles relatesto and is controlled by this lack of symmetry in the ORS and connective tissuesheath around the follicle.
Furthermore, Thibaut et al. [ 228] demonstrated that when curly hair ﬁbers(African or Caucasian) are dissected and removed from the scalp biopsy and thelower part of the hair follicle placed in in-vitro media the curvature of the emergingﬁber appears to be retained as if it were growing in the follicle. From theseexperiments these scientists concluded that hair curl is “programmed from thebulb” and is related to or controlled by “asymmetric differentiation” as the ﬁbermoves up the follicle.1.10 The Origin of Hair Fiber Curvature 75
I conclude that the primary factor controlling hair ﬁber curvature is programmedfrom the bulb by the symmetry of protein distribution. However, whether hairfollicle shape in the zone of keratinization affects hair ﬁber curvature in someway analogous to the production of a synthetic ﬁlament as it is extruded or whethercurvature is controlled entirely by programming from the bulb by the symmetry ofthe distribution of proteins in the ﬁnal ﬁber awaits further research.1.11 The Structure of the Cell Membrane ComplexThe cell membrane complex (CMC) consists of cell membranes and adhesivematerial that binds or “glues” the cuticle and cortical cells together in keratin ﬁbers.G.E. Rogers from his seminal high resolution transmission electron microscope(TEM) studies of animal hairs provided evidence for the general structure of theCMC. The CMC consists of a central Delta layer approximately 15 nm thicksandwiched by two lipid layers called Beta layers each in the vicinity of 5 nm
thick [ 212,229], see Fig. 1.26 adapted from Fraser, MacRae and Rogers [ 223].Jones et al. [ 230] described the uncertainty of the composition of the Delta layerbecause of the difﬁculty of isolating it without changing it.Questions still exist about the relative thickness and composition of the Betalayers between cuticle cells vs. the Beta layers of cortical cells (see Figs. 1.43,1.44and1.45) and between the upper Beta layer vs. the lower Beta layer of cuticle cells.Although, most authors quote the thicknesses of the Beta layers between 2.5 [ 114]and 5.0 nm, 6.0 nm has also been cited [ 130]. In addition the upper Beta layerFig. 1.43 Schematic diagram illustrating the location of the three types of CMC in hair ﬁbers(Reprinted with permission of the Journal of Cosmetic Science [ 203])76 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
appears to be thicker than the lower Beta layer [ 229,231]. Swift [ 107] in his reviewof the human hair cuticle described the difﬁculty of obtaining accuratemeasurements of the Beta layers in the high resolution TEM. Swift’s explanationclariﬁes the uncertainty that exists in ascribing mono-layers or bi-layers to theselipid strata on the basis of TEM measurements alone. From his TEM studies, SwiftFig. 1.44 Schematic proposed for the cuticle-cuticle CMC [ 203] (Reprinted with permission ofthe Journal of Cosmetic Science)Fig. 1.45 Schematic representing the cortex-cortex CMC [ 203] (Reprinted with permission of theJournal of Cosmetic Science)1.11 The Structure of the Cell Membrane Complex 77
[232] cited 3 nm thicknesses for the cuticle Beta layers. Relatively recent analysesby microbeam diffraction [ 142,143] also cite 3 nm thicknesses for these samelayers between cuticle cells, see the section entitled, Thickness of the Cuticle BetaLayers in this chapter.Three types of CMC have been described in the literature [ 233]: cuticle-cuticleCMC representing CMC between cuticle cells, cortex-cortex CMC representingCMC between cortical cells and cuticle-cortex CMC representing CMC at thecuticle cortex boundary see Fig. 1.46. Since Rogers’ [ 212,229] initial descriptionof the CMC and his additional work demonstrating that the Delta layer of the cortexconsists of ﬁve sub-layers [ 223] several additional important developments haveoccurred that will be described in the next section adding details to this importantstructure in animal hairs.1.11.1 General Differences for Cuticle-Cuticle CMC VersusCortex-Cortex CMC
Cortex-Cortex CMCJones and Rivett [ 125,234] provided evidence that the CMC of the cuticle contains18-methyl eicosanoic acid (18-MEA) in its upper Beta layer. 18-MEA has neverbeen shown to be in the CMC of the cortex. The facts strongly suggest that the CMCof the cuticle has monolayer lipids that are attached by covalent bonds (primarilythioester) [ 122,235] with some ester or amide linkages [ 235] to proteins of the cellFig. 1.46 Schematic representing the cuticle-cortex CMC [ 203] (Reprinted with permission of theJournal of Cosmetic Science)78 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
membranes on one end and attachment by van der Waals attractive forces toproteins of the Delta layer on the hydrophobic end of the fatty acids (Fig. 1.44).The evidence shows that the CMC between cortical cells consists of lipid bi-layersthat are not attached by covalent bonding to protein layers. The lipid bi-layers of thecortex are bound by salt linkages and polar bonding to the cortical cell membraneproteins on one side and similarly attached to the Delta layer on the other side of thebi-layer, see Fig. 1.45.1.11.2 The Cuticle-Cuticle CMCIn 1916 Allworden [ 126] discovered that Chlorine water reacts with the cuticle cellsof wool ﬁber to produce large bulbous sacs on the ﬁber surface. Chlorine waterdegrades proteins beneath the cuticle cell membranes, (most likely cleaving andoxidizing disulﬁde bonds between the epicuticle and the A-Layer [ 236]) producing
water soluble species too large to diffuse out of the semi-permeable cuticle cellmembrane. Swelling results from osmotic forces and the cuticle membranestretches producing the Allworden sacs (Fig. 1.29) that separate from the underly-ing proteinaceous cell layers.The epicuticle membrane was ﬁrst isolated and named by Lindberg et al. in 1949[237,238]. Nineteen years later, Leeder and Bradbury [ 100] deﬁned the epicuticleas the “thin outer membrane which is raised on the surface of ﬁbers as sacs bytreatment with chlorine water” in the Allworden reaction. The epicuticle (upper-most cuticle cell membrane) provides the supporting structure for fatty acids in thecuticle, see Fig. 1.44. It is also attached to the A-layer of cuticle cells of wool andhuman hair and together with 18-MEA is perhaps the most thoroughly studied partof the CMC. Leeder and Rippon [ 239] in 1985, suggested that the epicuticle was
proteinaceous and covered with a strongly bound lipid layer that could not beremoved by lipid solvents, but could be removed with alcoholic alkali. They calledthis covalently bound lipid layer the F-layer.The F layer together with the cuticle cell membranes (essentially the epicuticle)is analogous to the corniﬁed envelopes or the cellular envelope of stratum corneum.In 1945, Weitkamp [ 240] reported 18-MEA in wool wax (degras). Forty years later,in 1985, Evans et al. [ 241] demonstrated that 18-MEA is covalently bonded to thekeratin ﬁber surface by reacting wool ﬁber with anhydrous alkali after solventextractable lipids had been removed. The cleavage of 18-MEA with chlorine waterby Negri et al. [ 122] and by hydroxyl amine at neutral pH by Evans and Lanczki[235] support its attachment by a thioester linkage rather than an ester or amide link.In addition, Evans and Lanczki [ 235] and Korner and G. Wortmann [ 242] provided
evidence for ester and/or amide attachment of some fatty acids (primarily palmitic,stearic, oleic and others) mainly in the lower beta layer on the bottom of cuticlecells.Jones et al. [ 243] demonstrated that essentially all of the 18-MEA is in the upperBeta layer of the cuticle-cuticle CMC. Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a1.11 The Structure of the Cell Membrane Complex 79
genetic defect in humans and Poll Herford cattle [ 244] involving 18-MEA. MSUDis caused by a deﬁciency in the enzyme involved in the synthesis of 18-MEA.Isoleucine is a precursor in the biosynthesis of 18-MEA (an anteiso-fatty acid),involving the branched chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase, the enzyme that is deﬁ-cient in this genetic defect [ 234]. Anteiso- fatty acids in skin are synthesized fromthe amino acid, isoleucine [ 245]. Jones and Rivett in their TEM studies of MSUD[234,243] found that the structural defect of MSUD in human hair occurs only onthe upper surface of cuticle cells (upper Beta layer) where 18-MEA is replaced bystraight chain C18 and C20 fatty acids. But, the undersides of cuticle cells (lowerBeta layer) are not affected in MSUD. These facts conﬁrm that 18-MEA is attachedto the top surface of cuticle cells (upper Beta layer) and not to the underside.The proteins in the cuticle cell membranes are described in detail in this Chapter
in the section entitled Epicuticle and the Hair Fiber Surface . In 1993, Negri et al.[122] proposed a model for the keratin ﬁber surface consisting of a monolayer of18-MEA covalently bonded to an ultra high sulfur protein through a thioesterlinkage. These three scientists proposed this attachment at approximately 1 nmspacings. Furthermore, they suggested that the protein support was in the betaconﬁguration and it might be attached to the Allworden membrane.Although widely varying estimates of the thickness of the epicuticle have beenmade from 5 to 14 nm, one of the more recent and reliable estimates is by Swift andSmith [ 115]. These two scientists examined wool ﬁber, human hair and severalother mammalian hairs using high resolution TEM. They identiﬁed that the epicu-ticle is approximately 13 nm thick and is rich in cystine. Swift’s estimate of theepicuticle thickness is consistent with the maximum thickness reported by severalother workers [ 129,132,246].
Leeder and Bradbury [ 100,247] discovered that the Allworden reaction takesplace with isolated cuticle cells from several different animal hairs including wooland human hair ﬁber, proving that this proteinaceous material completely surroundseach cuticle cell and is not a continuous external membrane on hair ﬁbers. In thisimportant scientiﬁc effort, cuticle cells were isolated by shaking animal hairs informic acid. The isolated cuticle cells were then exposed to chlorine water. Formicacid is known to solubilize some proteins believed to be largely from the delta layerof the cell membrane complex. These effects on hair ﬁbers will be discussed later inthe section entitled Proteins of the CMC .In the intact ﬁber Allworden sacs form over the top of cuticle cells (the exposedsurface). Leeder and Bradbury suggested that “the sac always occurs on only oneside of the cuticle cell” that is the top of cuticle cells and not the bottom [ 100,236,
247]. They explained that this effect occurs because the connecting bonds on the topof cuticle cells are between the epicuticle and the A-layer and therefore are mostlikely through disulﬁde cross-links that are vulnerable to chlorine water oxidation[236]. Furthermore, they suggested that the connecting bonds on the underside ofcuticle cells are between the membrane and the endocuticle (actually the innerlayer, a layer about 10–40 nm thick [ 107] between the endocuticle and the cellmembrane and similar in composition to the exocuticle). The bonding on the80 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
underside of cuticle cells is resistant to chlorine water oxidation [ 236] and thereforecould be amide linkages.Negri et al. [ 122] determined that the Allworden reaction is an effect of themembranous proteins around cuticle cells. Furthermore, 18-MEA is not requiredfor the formation of Allworden sacs because the sacs can be produced from cuticlein which 18-MEA has been removed by prior treatment with either methanolicKOH or potassium t-butoxide in t-butanol. Because of the bulky nature of thet-butoxide anion, it removes only covalently bound fatty acid at or near the ﬁbersurface. Furthermore, Negri et al. [ 122] demonstrated that removal of the covalentlybound fatty acid facilitates the formation of Allworden sacs because the rateof formation of the sacs increases with prior removal of the covalently bound18-MEA.Zahn et al. [ 133] proposed from indirect evidence using multiple regression
analyses for the amino acids from Allen’s Allworden membrane data that loricrin,involucrin and an ultra-high sulfur protein were in the epicuticle. These scientistswere relating the cell envelope of keratin ﬁbers to the cell envelope of humanstratum corneum and the work of Steinert and Marekov [ 252], Jarnik et al. [ 253]and Steven and Steinert [ 254]. See Table 1.19, describing the amino acid analysesTable 1.19 Amino acids (in mole%) of Allworden membrane vs. calculated values for Wool CEby Zahn et al.

of these and other important proteins adapted from the paper by Zahn, Wortmannand Hocker.However, more recently, Rogers and Koike [ 134] used laser capture microscopyto dissect the cuticle, cortex and inner root sheath of human hair ﬁbers. In thismanner, these scientists isolated RNA which was subjected to PCR analysis withspeciﬁc primers to identify mRNA’s encoding the surface proteins. No evidencewas found for either loricrin or involucrin in the cuticle cell membrane sections, butevidence was found for KAPs 5 and 10 proteins that were likely cross-linked byboth disulﬁde and isopeptide bonds.Therefore, the proteins of the cuticle cell membranes are associated with theAllworden reaction [ 126] and are related to the epicuticle and from the work ofRogers and Koike [ 134] contain KAP’s 5 and 10 ultra high sulfur proteins. Since the
attachment of 18-MEA to hair proteins is through thioester linkages and the cuticlecell membrane protein is cross linked by cystine bridges, Negri et al. [ 122]proposed that the lipid layer must be attached to an ultrahigh sulfur protein(UHSP) that can provide attachment sites at approximately 1 nm spacings alongthe top of its folded chains. This attachment is likely to the KAP’s 5 and or 10proteins.1.11.3 Bilayers Versus Monolayers in the Cuticle-Cuticle CMCWhether or not the covalently bound lipids of the cuticle-cuticle CMC are bondedto another lipid layer on their hydrophobic end forming a bi-layer or they arebonded to a hydrophobic protein in the Delta layer is still debated, but this authorbelieves the evidence clearly favors the monolayer model [ 107,255] for thefollowing reasons:• If the Beta layers are mono-layers then 18-MEA is linked to the Delta layerthrough hydrophobic bonds making the upper Beta layer susceptible to failure at
the Delta layer where it has been shown to fail [ 107,255–257].• Swift [ 107] pointed out that a monolayer model ﬁts better from the point of viewof CMC measurements, see the section below entitled, Thickness of the CuticleBeta Layers. Free lipids are very likely in the cuticle Beta layers and thedistribution and orientation of these will help determine the thickness of Betalayers.• If bi-layers exist in the cuticle, there are two options for bonding of the secondfatty acid layer to the Delta layer. One is for fatty acids to be covalently bondedto the Delta layer, but this option is not plausible because in human hair and woolﬁber 40–50% of the covalently bound fatty acids are 18-MEA [ 258–260].
Therefore, there are insufﬁcient covalently bound fatty acids in human hairand wool ﬁber to account for all these fatty acids. The other option is bondingof the second layer of fatty acids through hydrophobic linkages to the covalentlybound fatty acids and bonding to the Delta layer through polar and ionic82 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
bonding. However, this type of bonding would provide Beta-Beta failure and notBeta-Delta failure and allow for solvent removal of the non-covalently boundlipid layer which has been shown to occur in cortex-cortex CMC but not incuticle-cuticle CMC [ 261,262]. To provide Beta-delta failure from this bi-layermodel, the new hair surface would form a bi-layer consisting primarily ofhydrophilic acid groups at the very surface, so this bi-layer model is also notplausible.• Negri et al. [ 263] noted that formic acid removes proteins more readily from thecortex-cortex CMC and it modiﬁes CMC junctions of the cortex more than thoseof the cuticle which is consistent with covalent and hydrophobic bonding of thecuticle-cuticle CMC as shown by the monolayer model of Fig. 1.44, rather than abi-layer model.1.11.4 Thickness of the Cuticle Beta LayersMuch confusion exists about the actual thickness of the CMC monolayers as
mentioned previously. Swift [ 232], from a TEM study cited 3 nm thickness forthe cuticle Beta layers. Relatively recent analyses by microbeam diffraction [ 142,143] also cite 3 nm thicknesses for these same layers between cuticle cells. Part ofthe confusion about the actual thickness and bi-layers vs. monolayers exists becausemany consider only the fatty acyl group of 18-MEA as the Beta layer. However, asthe following discussion will show that view is not possible.To measure the thickness of the beta layers Swift [ 232] used a uranyl acetate/lead citrate stain that stains only carboxylic acid groups. So he measured theunstained part of the TEM images for the Beta layers which he found to beapproximately 3.0 nm thick [ 232]. Thus, only part of Swift’s measurement wasactually the length of the hydrocarbon portion of 18-MEA fully stretched out (fromthe thioester group to the end of the hydrocarbon chain which is about 2.39 nm long(for MEA attached at a 90
/C14angle and fully stretched out), see Fig. 1.47. Assumingthat the fatty acids of free lipids in between MEA chains are oriented so that thecarboxylic acid groups are associating with the thioester groups which is the moststable orientation, then that is where the staining begins on one side because thestain reacts with carboxylic acid groups.But, 18-MEA is attached to the protein membrane at an angle of approximately72/C14(from molecular modeling). So, this angle provides a length of 2.28 nm for theacyl group of 18-MEA alone for the upper Beta layer. Now, since free lipidstructures are in between these 18-MEA chains then 18-MEA will be fully stretchedout from that angle of 72/C14.Now, for the entire unstained part of the Beta layer we must also consider the
fatty groups of the Delta layer proteins that the 18-MEA is bonded to all the way tothe nearest carboxylic acid side chain; because that is where the staining begins onthe other side of this lipid layer. Assuming that this outer protein of the Delta layeris in the Beta conﬁguration and the Van der Waals bonding of 18-MEA is to a1.11 The Structure of the Cell Membrane Complex 83
hydrocarbon containing amino acid (which it must be), and the nearest amino acidcontains a carboxylic acid unit, then this length is approximately an additional0.73 nm.Therefore, the hydrocarbon groups of the Delta layer proteins together with thehydrocarbon groups of 18-MEA form what is actually the unstained lipid Betalayer. So, the total calculated thickness of the Beta layer by TEM would beapproximately 2.28 + 0.73 ¼3.01 nm. Swift [ 232] found 3.00 nm in excellentagreement. Now if the fatty acid groups are oriented so that their carboxylic groupsare near the terminal hydrocarbon end of 18-MEA, then the thickness would beeven larger. But, this should be a less stable orientation and not consistent with XPSdata showing that the surface of virgin keratin ﬁbers is hydrocarbon-like [ 125].1.11.5 Globular Versus Glycoproteins in the CMCIn formic acid extracts, Allen et al. [ 264] found evidence for glycoproteins in
several different animal hairs which they suggested could be from the CMC.However, they suggested that these ingredients might also be remains of cellmembrane glycoproteins from the follicle or they could be functional adhesivematerials from the CMC. I believe the current evidence favors globular protein inthe Delta layer as functional adhesive materials for these reasons:• The Delta layer resists solubilization by aqueous reducing or oxidizing agents orby acids and alkalies [ 265]. If the CMC contains globular proteins like manyother membranes, then they contain large domains of hydrophobic amino acidson their surfaces [ 266]. Such a surface is ideal for the hydrophobic ends of theFig. 1.47 Schematicillustrating the thickness ofthe cuticle upper Beta layer84 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
covalently bound fatty acids to adhere to. Furthermore, this type of globularprotein should be resistant to aqueous reagents as Bryson found.• Bryson et al. in 1995 [ 265] isolated lipid soluble lipoproteins from the Deltalayer of cortex-cortex CMC and not glycoprotein.• The Delta layer stains with Phosphotungstic acid (PTA). This is either a reactionof hydroxyl groups of a polysaccharide or a primary amine function. Swift [ 107]explained that this reaction is blocked with dinitroﬂuorobenzene (DNFB); there-fore it is more likely a reaction involving primary amine groups, consistent witha globular protein.• The Delta layer reacts with periodic acid/silver methenamine [ 107] a method forpolysaccharides, however, Swift [ 107] also pointed out that since cystineinterferes with this reaction, it is still consistent with a globular protein in theDelta layer.Thus, the globular protein model is consistent with the currently known reactiv-
ity of the cuticle-cuticle CMC and the proposed structure of Fig. 1.44. Therefore theglycoproteins that Allen, Ellis and Rivet found were most likely remains of cellmembrane material from the follicle.1.11.6 The Cortex-Cortex CMCWertz and Downing [ 259] found that the percentage of 18-MEA relative to the totalamount of covalently bound fatty acids varied from 38% to 48% in ﬁve differentmammalian hairs including sheep, humans, dog, pig and cow. Table 1.20summarizes a tabulation of analyses of the covalently bound lipids of wool andhuman hair from several different laboratories. These results were obtained after theﬁbers had been exhaustively extracted with chloroform/methanol to remove thenon-covalently bound fatty acids and then the residue was saponiﬁed withmethanolic alkali showing that 18-MEA accounts for about 50% of the covalentlybound fatty acids in these wool ﬁbers and about 40% in human hair.Table 1.20 Covalently bound fatty acids in wool and human hair ﬁber

Wortmann [ 242] (Table 1.20), analyzed covalently bound fatty acidsin isolated wool cuticle and found 55% 18-MEA, 25% stearic and 20% palmiticacid with “only traces of other straight and odd number carbon chain fatty acids.”For wool ﬁber Wertz and Downing [ 259] found 48% 18-MEA and 17% palmiticacid, 10% stearic acid, 5% oleic acid and the remaining covalently bound fatty acidsranged from C16 through C20 with 6% uncharacterized. For human hair, Wertz andDowning [ 258] found 41% 18-MEA, 18%, palmitic acid, 7% stearic acid, 4% oleicacid and the remaining small percentages of fatty acids from C16 through C20 with9% uncharacterized. Negri et al. [ 268] found 72% 18-MEA, 8% palmitic acid, 6%stearic acid and 5% oleic acid in wool ﬁber.The variation in these data from different laboratories is quite large. Part of the
variance must be related to ﬁber diameter and the number of layers of covalentlybound fatty acids in the ﬁbers. However, certainly part of this variance is due toexperimental error. The bottom line is that somewhere in the vicinity of 50 /C6about10% of the covalently bound fatty acids in most keratin ﬁbers is 18-MEA and thathair ﬁbers from sheep, humans, dog, pig and cattle and likely most keratin ﬁberscontain palmitic, stearic and oleic with other fatty acids as the remaining covalentlybound fatty acids.In 1990, Kalkbrenner et al. [ 269] demonstrated with isolated cuticle cells that18-MEA is essentially all in the cuticle. Since 18-MEA represents more than 40%of the total covalently bound fatty acids in human hair and about 50% in wool ﬁber,18-MEA is conﬁned to the upper Beta layer of the cuticle [ 243,244] while most(essentially an amount equal to the 18-MEA) of the other covalently bound fattyacids are conﬁned to the lower Beta layer. Therefore, most of the covalently bound
fatty acids in wool and hair ﬁber must be in the cuticle-cuticle CMC with some inthe cuticle-cortex CMC (to be described later) and virtually none in the cortex-cortex CMC. Therefore, if most of the covalently bound fatty acids are in thecuticle-cuticle CMC, then most of the lipids of the cortex-cortex CMC must bebound to the membranes on one side and to the Delta layer on the other side by non-covalent bonds. The fact that most of the remaining lipids can be removed bysolvent extraction conﬁrms that this is the case.Leeder et al. [ 128] were the ﬁrst to report that there are virtually nophospholipids in keratin ﬁbers. This fact was conﬁrmed by Schwan and Zahn[270] and by Rivett [ 271] casting doubt on whether lipid bi-layers could beinvolved in the cell membranes of keratin ﬁbers [ 128]. However, Wertz et al.[272] demonstrated that liposomes (lipid bi-layers and a presumed precursor to
the formation of lipid bi-layers in the CMC of keratin ﬁbers) can form from lipids inthe absence of phospholipids if an acid species such as cholesterol sulfate is present.Furthermore, evidence has been provided conﬁrming the existence of cholesterolsulfate in human hair by Wertz and Downing [ 258] and by Korner et al. in woolﬁber [ 273].86 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
The work of Korner, Petrovic and Hocker [ 273] builds upon the ﬁndings ofWertz et al. on liposome formation and lipids from stratum corneum [ 272]. Korneret al. [ 273] demonstrated that cell membrane lipids extracted from human hair andwool ﬁber with chloroform/methanol/aqueous potassium chloride can formliposomes. These ﬁndings provide evidence for a bi-layer structure of the internallipids of the Beta layers of the cortical CMC in wool ﬁber and in human hair, seeFig.1.45. Such extracts must come primarily from the cortex-cortex CMC becausecovalently bound MEA and the other covalently bound lipids of the cuticle CMCare not removed with this solvent system.Therefore, if the Beta layers of the cuticle cells are primarily covalently boundfatty acids with some free lipids (see Fig. 1.44) and the Beta layers of cortical cellsconsist primarily of lipid bi-layers (Fig. 1.45), then it is highly probable that the
proteins that these different types of lipid layers are attached to, that is the cellmembrane proteins and the Delta layer proteins of the cuticle cells and the corticalcells, are also different .1.11.8 Differences in Cuticle-Cuticle, Cortex-Cortex andCuticle-Cortex CMCAs early as 1975, Nakamura et al. [ 233] provided evidence from staining reactionsthat the disulﬁde content in the Delta layer in cuticle-cuticle CMC is lower than thedisulﬁde content of the Delta layer in either cuticle-cortex or cortex-cortex CMC. Inaddition, Nakamura et al. added that the Delta layer of the cuticle-cuticle CMCstains similar to the endocuticle.In 1983, Leeder et al. [ 128] used TEM to study the effect of solvents on woolﬁbers and found that formic acid treatment of wool modiﬁed the CMC of the ﬁbers.This effect was only observed between adjacent cortical cells and not betweencuticle and cortical cells. These scientists suggested that these results are consistent
with differences in the CMC between cuticle cells vs. the CMC between cuticle andcortical cells.Peters and Bradbury [ 274] observed that formic acid treatment of wool modiﬁedthe cell membrane complex of the cortex “but that of the cuticle appearsunchanged”. They also analyzed “resistant membranes”. These membranes wereisolated by shaking wool ﬁbers in formic acid and then oxidized with performicacid. This treatment produced an oxidized cell membrane material; however, theamino acid analysis produced considerably lower values for cystine than theanalysis of Allworden membranes by Allen et al. [ 132]. Peters and Bradburyconcluded that the “CMC of the cuticle differs from that of the cortex”.Leeder et al. in 1985 [ 275] described differences in the staining characteristics of
the cuticle-cuticle CMC, the cuticle-cortex CMC and the cortex-cortex CMC. Afterdyeing the ﬁbers with a Uranyl dye these scientists found a layer of dye around eachcuticle cell that was restricted to the CMC of the cuticle and not in the CMC of the1.11 The Structure of the Cell Membrane Complex 87
cortex. They found only one dye layer at the cuticle-cortex junction and none in thecortex-cortex CMC, but two layers of dye in the cuticle-cuticle CMC. In their paper,these scientists referred to the observations of Nakamura [ 233] on differences in thestaining characteristics of these three types of CMC.Mansour and Jones in 1989 [ 261] treated wool by Soxhlet extraction withchloroform/methanol for 5 h and subsequently in boiling water for 15 min. Theyexamined the ﬁbers by electron microscopy after each stage of treatment. After theinitial solvent extraction, the cuticle-cortex CMC appeared unmodiﬁed, while thestaining intensity of the Beta layers between cortical cells were changed andappeared “intermittent”. After solvent extraction for 5 h and hydrolysis for15 min signiﬁcant structural changes were observed. The cortex-cortex CMCshowed an overall reduction in deﬁnition in the Delta layer and the Beta layers
displayed a lack of clear deﬁnition. These scientists suggested that solvent extrac-tion of intercellular lipids makes the hair more vulnerable to hydrolytic damagewith the largest changes occurring in the cortex-cortex CMC. These scientistsrelated this effect to a reduction in tear strength of wool ﬁber by solvent extractionand hydrolysis. These results show that the cuticle-cortex CMC behaves differentlyfrom the cortex-cortex CMC to solvent extraction. The cuticle-cortex CMC isdamaged by solvent extraction and subsequent hydrolysis, but not as severely asthe cortex-cortex CMC.Logan, Jones and Rivett [ 262] in 1990 examined wool ﬁbers by TEM after
extraction with chloroform/methanol and found that the cuticle-cuticle CMCappeared unchanged compared to untreated ﬁbers. On the other hand they foundthat the Delta layer in the cortex was smaller and displayed variable stainingintensity in most regions which they deduced as “incomplete or preferential extrac-tion”. These scientists examined ﬁber sections after chloroform/methanol extrac-tion followed by treatment with formic acid. They noted large changes in the Betaand Delta layers of the cortex-cortex CMC which were “rarely observed” in thecuticle-cuticle CMC. They concluded that these results show “inherent differencesexist between CMC’s of cuticle and those of cortical cells”.Negri and Rivett et al. [ 263] in a paper in 1996 referred to the work of Leederet al. [ 275] and cited the work of Leeder et al. [ 128] who showed that the unstained
Beta layers of the cuticle and cortex react differently to formic acid treatment.Leeder and Marshall [ 276] demonstrated that formic acid removes proteins fromthe cortex-cortex CMC and it modiﬁes the CMC junctions of the cortex but not thecuticle-cuticle CMC junctions and they referenced Nakamura [ 233], and Leederet al. [ 128] and Peters and Bradbury [ 274] on these effects. They concluded thatthese observations suggest that only the Beta layers of the cuticle-cuticle CMCcontain covalently bound lipids while the Beta layers of the cortex contain lipidsand a “stain-resistant membrane protein” that is “likely to be of a different structurethan the cuticle membrane”.Inoue et al. in 2007 [ 277] analyzed human hair by microbeam x-ray diffractionafter extraction with polar organic solvents (methanol or chloroform/methanol) at37/C14C for 6 h. These treatments remove some material from the Delta layer of the
cuticle-cuticle CMC, but the Beta layers were unaffected. On the other hand, the88 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
Beta layers of the cuticle-cuticle CMC appeared to be affected by hexane extractionunder the same conditions. The observation that changes in the Delta layer of thecuticle-cuticle CMC by chloroform/methanol extraction could be detected suggeststhis method is more sensitive than TEM [ 262]. The fact that Inoue et al. observedchanges in the Beta layers of the cuticle-cuticle CMC by hexane extraction couldresult from removal of free lipids between the covalently bound fatty acids of thecuticle-cuticle CMC resulting in folding back of the covalently bound fatty acids inthe Beta layers accounting for the differences found.The above discussion shows clearly that both the lipid Beta layers and theproteins of the cell membranes and those of the Delta layer of the cuticle-cuticleCMC differ from those of the cortex-cortex CMC, with evidence for differencesfrom the cuticle-cortex CMC also.1.11.9 The Structure of the Cuticle-Cortex CMC
1.11.9 The Structure of the Cuticle-Cortex CMCThe following proposal for the cuticle-cortex CMC (Fig. 1.46) is based on logic andthe following supporting evidence. The work of Nakamura [ 233] suggested that thecuticle-cortex CMC differs from both the cuticle-cuticle CMC and the cortex-cortex CMC. The work of Leeder et al. [ 128] and of Mansour and Jones [ 261]demonstrated that the cuticle-cortex CMC is more resistant to solvents than thecortex-cortex CMC. But, the most convincing evidence for this model (Fig. 1.46)i sthe Uranyl dye study by Leeder et al. [ 275]. Treatment of wool ﬁber with Uranyldye showed two layers of dye in the cuticle-cuticle CMC, one layer of dye in thecuticle-cortex CMC and no layers of dye in the cortex-cortex CMC.Since the cuticle-cortex CMC bridges cuticle and cortical cells, it is logical to
assume that it is a hybrid based partly on the cuticle-cuticle CMC and the cortex-cortex CMC. Therefore, the membrane on the cuticle side would be the cuticle cellmembrane which supports covalently bound fatty acids that are bonded eitherthrough thioester, ester or amide linkages and these covalently bound fatty acidsare connected on their hydrophobic end to a hydrophobic protein in the Delta layer.The membrane on the cortex side is a cortical cell membrane that supports fattyacids bound through polar and salt linkages as illustrated in the schematic ofFig. 1.46 and these fatty acids form a lipid bi-layer. The Delta layer of thecuticle-cortex CMC then should contain a hydrophobic protein on one side(bound to the Beta layer on the cuticle side) and a hydrophilic protein on theopposite side bound through polar and salt linkages to the lipid bi-layer. Leederet al. [ 275] in their TEM study on dyeing and diffusion suggested that either the
cuticle Beta layer or the resistant membrane surrounding cuticle cells has an afﬁnityfor the uranyl dye whereas the cortical cell membrane or the Delta layer betweencortical cells does not. The models of Fig. 1.46 (for the cuticle-cortex CMC),Fig.1.44 (for the cuticle-cuticle CMC) and Fig. 1.45 (for the cortex-cortex CMC)are consistent with the results and explanation by Leeder et al. [ 275] of the uranyldye binding in the different CMC’s.1.11 The Structure of the Cell Membrane Complex 89
1.11.10 The Formation of the CMC in Developing HairsThe following description of the formation of the CMC in the developing hair ﬁberwas taken from the work of Rogers [ 26], plus from the early work by Orwin andcoworkers [ 278] along with more recent work by Jones and coworkers [ 279]. Formore details of the formation of the CMC in developing hair ﬁbers, I refer you to thereview by Jones and Rivett [ 125] and this paper by Jones, Horr and Kaplin [ 279].In the latter stages of development of the hair ﬁber, desmosomes or intercellularbridges, gap junctions (where cells exchange molecules) and tight junctions (inter-cellular junctions where cell membranes fuse) are established betweendifferentiating keratinocytes of the hair ﬁber and the inner root sheath to varyingextents as they move upward in the hair follicle. Orwin et al. [ 278] described that
gap junctions and desmosomes cover about 10% of the plasma membrane ofcortical cells in the bulb region and then they gradually degenerate.Tight junctions are established between Henle’s outermost layer of the inner rootsheath and Huxley’s layer of the inner root sheath and between Henle cells and theclose companion layer of the outer root sheath. These junctions are replaced with anew cell membrane complex that gradually develops as a continuous complexbetween the cells. Similar events should occur for cuticle-cuticle CMC, cuticle-cortex CMC and cortex-cortex CMC with appropriate distinctions.1.12 The MedullaFraser et al. [ 169] suggested that ﬁne animal hairs such as merino wool—consistonly of cuticle and cortex, but with increasing ﬁber thickness, a third type of cell,the medulla, is usually found (see Figs. 1.3,1.4and1.48). In thick animal hairs such
as horse tail or mane or porcupine quill, the medulla comprises a relatively largepercentage of the ﬁber mass. However, in human hair, the medulla—if present—generally comprises only a small percentage of this mass. The medulla may beeither completely absent, or highly variable [ 280], for example, it may be continu-ous along the ﬁber axis, or discontinuous. In some instances, a double or dividedmedulla may be observed (see Fig. 1.49).Medullary cells are loosely packed, and during dehydration (formation), theyleave a series of vacuoles along the ﬁber axis see Figs. 1.48 and1.49. At highermagniﬁcation medullary cells appear spherical and hollow inside and are boundtogether by a cell membrane complex type material (see Fig. 1.50). Menkart et al.[156] suggested that the medulla contributes negligibly to the chemical and
mechanical properties of human hair ﬁbers. Therefore, for human hair, medulla isof greater importance to forensic science (for hair comparison identiﬁcation) than tocosmetic science.Das-Chaudhuri and Chopra [ 281] compared medulla with scalp hair ﬁberdiameters for 12 different populations from different geographical regions. These90 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
scientists considered only hairs with and without medulla and considered a medul-lary ratio of P/Q where P represents the total number of medullated hairs and Q thenumber of total hairs. One hundred hairs per individual were examined. Their dataprovided a signiﬁcant correlation between hair diameters and medulla with acorrelation coefﬁcient of 0.58 and an index of determination of 0.34.Banerjee [ 282] collected data from 12 different populations in India where heconsidered hair ﬁber diameter and three medullation types: hairs with a continuousmedulla, a discontinuous medulla and hairs with no medulla. Examination of themeans of the different diameters of these three medulla classes by the matched pairstest shows a highly signiﬁcant relationship with p >t¼0.02. The hairs with nomedulla were the ﬁnest, those with a discontinuous medulla were medium indiameter and those with a continuous medulla were the coarsest. Hardy [ 106]
also found a positive correlation between human scalp hair ﬁber diameter andmedullation.Fig. 1.48 Scanning electronmicrograph illustrating theporous medulla of a hair ﬁbercross sectionFig. 1.49 An optical section of a light micrograph illustrating a hair ﬁber with a divided or doublemedulla. Multiple medullas seem more common in facial than scalp hair (Kindly provided by JohnT. Wilson)1.12 The Medulla 91
Wynkoop [ 283] classiﬁed hairs according to four different medulla types:absent, scanty, broken and continuous. She considered age and ﬁber diameter vs.medulla type. Wynkoop concluded that the amount and type of medulla are notrelated to age, but the amount of medulla is related to hair ﬁber diameter and thatthe ﬁnest hairs generally do not contain a medulla, medium-sized hairs generallycontain a broken medulla and the thickest hairs generally contain a continuousmedulla. So, there is a strong positive relationship between hair ﬁber diameter andthe amount of medulla; thus ﬁne hair of children generally does not contain amedulla [ 49], but coarser hairs of adults generally contains either a discontinuous orcontinuous medulla.Tolgyesi [ 153] demonstrated that beard hair is coarser than scalp hair and itcontains a higher percentage of medulla than scalp hair. There is generally moremedulla in the coarser hairs of Asians than Caucasians; however, many Caucasian
Fig. 1.50 Scanning electron micrograph illustrating the hollow sphere-like structures of themedulla (Kindly provided by Sigrid Ruetsch)92 1 Morphological, Macromolecular Structure and Hair Growth
hairs do contain medulla. The more ﬁne the individual hair ﬁber, the lower theprobability that medulla is present and the lower percentage of medulla mass.At one time the presence of keratin proteins in the medulla was questioned [ 284].In addition, Dobb [ 285] indicated that medulla of many hairs is difﬁcult to isolateand therefore has received little scientiﬁc attention, however, Langbein et al. [ 280]demonstrated that several keratin proteins and a few cortical cells can be found inhuman beard hair medulla. These scientists found that 12 hair keratins and 12epithelial keratins are potentially expressed in medullary cells and the keratinarrangement is very irregular in each medulla cell. The chemical composition ofmedullary protein derived from African porcupine quill has been reported byRogers [ 205] and is described in Chap. 2along with additional details on thecomposition of medulla from human beard hair and the medullary proteins byLangbein et al. [ 280].
Langbein et al. [ 280].The medulla does seem to play a role in gray hair, as suggested by Nagase et al.[286] by scattering light through a change in refractive index at the air to hairinterface of medullary “pores”. This effect is analogous to the effect in the geneticabnormality of pili annulati also known as ringed hair. Pili annulati appears asbands or rings of silver/gray and dark regions along the ﬁber axis. These bands arenot associated with pigmentation. Musso [ 287] working with guidance from RDBFraser observed that ringed hair contains bands or areas with air spaces in the cortexalong the axis that correspond to the silver or gray bands. The air spaces arebelieved to be caused by a defect in the synthesis of the microﬁbril-matrix complexin the cortex, most likely with less being produced. This effect creates cavities or airspaces in the hair [ 287], see the section entitled Hair Abnormalities in Chap. 3.The
medulla may also be involved in the splitting of hairs since in addition to the CMCit provides a pathway or an area of weakness for the propagation of cracks along theaxis of the ﬁber as described by Kamath and Weigmann [ 200].References1.

Chapter 2Chemical Composition of Different Hair TypesAbstract Human hair consists of proteins, lipids, water, trace elements andpigments. The composition of the ﬁrst four of these components is the focus ofthis Chapter. About two decades ago the emphasis on the proteins of hair was on itsamino acid constituents which provided important information on the relativeamounts of different functional groups in different types of hair and in differentregions of the ﬁber. However, as a result of advances in the characterization andclassiﬁcation of the different proteins and genes of keratins and keratin associated
proteins the focus today is on the proteins themselves. Several important newcontributions to the composition of the surface layers of hair and the proteins ofthe cell membrane complex have been and are continuing and therefore aresummarized in this Chapter. The current state of changes in the amino acids,proteins and lipids of hair by morphological region (including KAP and keratinproteins and where they reside), chemical and sunlight damage, diet, puberty andmenopause, and other factors have been and are being made and are summarizedhere. An expanded section on metals in hair, where in the ﬁber these metals resideand the functional groups that they bind to and their effects on hair chemistry,toxicity and disorders are included.2.1 Introduction
2.1 IntroductionSeveral important new and relatively recent contributions to the structure of the cellmembrane complex, the composition of the surface layers of hair, the overallstructure of the hair ﬁber and its follicle have been added to this Chapter. Recentstudies revealed details about endogenous and exogenous hair lipids and the criticalinvolvement of proteins and free lipids in the surface layers of hair including lipidcontributions to the protective properties of the cuticle and the isoelectric point.Advances in the classiﬁcation and characterization of the different proteins andgenes involved in keratin and keratin associated proteins in human hair aresummarized in this Chapter and the analysis of protein fragments from hairC.R.

damaged by cosmetic chemicals is a new and exciting area for future research. Theeffects of menopause on changes in the lipids of scalp hair have been added to thisChapter and the recently found effects of menopause on the diameter of hair ﬁbershave been added to Chap. 9.Human hair is a complex tissue consisting of several morphological components(see Chap. 1), and each component consists of several different chemical types [ 1].Hair is an integrated system in terms of its structure and its chemical and physicalbehavior wherein its components can act separately or as a unit. For example, thefrictional behavior of hair is related primarily to the cuticle, yet, the cuticle, thecortex and its intercellular components act in concert to determine the softness ofhair. The tensile behavior of human hair is determined largely by the cortex, yet wehave learned that the physical integrity of the ﬁber to combing and grooming forces
is also affected by the non-keratin components of the cuticle and the cell membranecomplex. Nevertheless, for simplicity and ease of discussion, the different types ofchemicals that comprise human hair are generally described separately in thisChapter.Depending on its moisture content (up to 32% by weight), human hair, consistsof approximately 65% to 95% proteins. Proteins are condensation polymers ofamino acids. The structures of those amino acids that are found in human hair aredepicted in Table 2.1. Because of the large number of chemical reactions thathuman hair is subjected to by permanent waves, chemical bleaches, alkalinestraighteners and sunlight exposure, many of the proteins are fragmented andseveral of these amino acids are converted to amino acid derivatives depicted inTable 2.2. The remaining constituents are water, lipids (structural and free), pig-
ment, and trace elements that are generally not free, but combined chemically withside chains of protein groups or with fatty-acid groups of sorbed or bound lipid.These different components of hair: proteins, lipids, water and trace elements aredescribed separately in this Chapter while pigments are described in more detail inChap. 5.Studies of the proteinaceous matter of human hair may be classiﬁed according tothe following types of investigation:Studies of individual or several amino acids,Analysis of types of amino acids,Fractionation and peptide analysis,Expression of genes, using in situ hybridization or reverse transcriptase-poly-merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) expression by hair follicles or the use ofspeciﬁc protein antibodies or related techniques.Most studies of individual amino acids of keratin ﬁbers involve the amino acids
cystine or tryptophan. Quantitation of cystine can be accomplished by chemicalanalysis of mercaptan with [ 2,3] or without hydrolysis [ 4] or spectrophotometri-cally on intact hair [ 5,6]. With increasing sophistication in instrumental analysis,ESCA, SIMS, and different absorbance, reﬂectance and ﬂuorescence techniques,spectrophotometric analysis on intact hair is becoming increasingly important.106 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
Chemical analyses for tryptophan have been described by Block and Bolling [ 7]and are all hydrolytic procedures.McMillen and Jachowicz [ 8] based on prior work in the wool industry analyzedtryptophan and its kynurenine reaction products by ﬂuorescence spectroscopy usingexcitation wavelengths of 290, 320 and 350 nm which provides emission bands at345, 420 and 465 nm. The emission band with a maximum at 345 nm corresponds toTryptophan with an absorption maximum at about 360 nm. The emission peak at465 nm from excitation at 320 and 350 nm matches the emission band of 1-kynurenine which has an absorption maximum at about 360 nm. The emissionmaximum at 420 nm was ascribed to N-Formylkynurenine and has an absorptionTable 2.1 Structures of amino acids found in hydrolyzates from human hair (molecular weightsof these amino acids are listed in brackets)CO2_ NH3NH3CH3CO2_NH3CO2_NH3CO2_NH3CO2_NH3CO2_NH3CO2_OH++Glycine [75]Alanine [89]Isoleucine [131]++

maximum at 320 nm. In this paper on thermal degradation of hair, the authorsclaimed that the spectra after thermal exposure indicate a decrease in the emissionintensities of all bands, probably related to thermal decomposition of thecorresponding chromophores. The largest reduction in the emission intensity isevident for the band at 345 nm corresponding to Tryptophan providing evidence forits photochemical degradation.Quantitative determination of several amino acids in human hair becameincreasingly widespread years ago following the development of the ion exchangechromatographic systems of Moore and Stein [ 9].

sequencing techniques such as the use of Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers,or analysis of cDNA’s with sequences that code speciﬁc proteins or even digestionto speciﬁc peptides and analysis by mass spectrometry or the use of speciﬁc proteinantibodies or other techniques have become increasingly important. Studies ofamino acid types are also used today, but less frequently. These involve determina-tion of a speciﬁc functional group where more than one amino acid contains thattype of group such as, the titration of basic groups [ 10] and of acidic groups [ 10].Fractionation and peptide analysis is concerned primarily with fractionation into
similar peptide types or even fractionation into the different morphologicalcomponents. Major areas of hair research concerned with the chemical compositionof hair and wool ﬁbers, over the last two decades, have involved proteomics or thedetermination of the total proteins present in a fraction or region of the hair. Thisdeﬁnition has been extended by some to include determining the proteins fromTable 2.2 Structure of amino acid degradation/derivative products found in human hairaDerivatives of cystineCystine oxidation products from peroxide bleaching–CH–CH 2–S–SO–CH 2–CH– cystine monoxide–CH–CH 2–S–SO 2–CH 2–CH– cystine dioxide–CH–CH 2–SO 3M cysteic acid saltFrom sulﬁte perms and sunlight oxidation–CH–CH 2–S–SO 3M Bunte saltFrom TGA perms–CH–CH 2–S–S–CH 2–CO 2MFrom GMT perms–CH–CH 2–S–S–CH 2–CO–O–CH 2–CH(OH)–CH 2–OHHydrolysis gives the derivative above from TGA permsFrom cysteamine perms–CH–CH2–S–S–CH 2–CH 2–NH 2*HX

which fractions are derived from chemical degradation of hair by perming, oxida-tion and straightening reactions. Several important papers have been publisheddeﬁning and classifying the types of proteins in human hair ﬁbers. An initialclassiﬁcation of hair proteins was described by Powell and G.E. Rogers. Importantadditions to this work have been reviewed in papers by M.A. Rogers and Langbeinet al. that are described in detail and referenced in Chap. 1as well as in this Chapterin the section entitled, Major Protein Fractions of Hair . In addition, the structure,composition and degradation of the cuticle, the cortex and medulla, the cellmembrane complex and the composition of structural hair lipids are the majorfocus of this Chapter.2.2 The Amino Acids and Proteins of Different Types of Hair2.2.1 Whole-Fiber Amino Acid StudiesMore than three decades ago, a large number of investigations were described on
the analysis of the amino acids of whole human hair ﬁbers. Whole-ﬁber amino acidanalysis has several limitations, because it provides average values for the aminoacid contents of the average proteinaceous substances of the ﬁbers. Therefore, forwhole-ﬁber results, cross-sectional and axial differences in the composition of theﬁbers are averaged.A second complicating factor is hydrolytic decomposition of certain aminoacids. The most commonly used medium for keratin ﬁber hydrolysis is 5–6 Nhydrochloric acid. In studies involving acid hydrolysis of keratins, partial decom-position has been reported for cystine, threonine, tyrosine [ 11], phenylalanine, andarginine [ 12] with virtually complete destruction of tryptophan [ 12].With the above limitations in mind, the following discussion describes severalimportant factors contributing to differences in the whole-ﬁber amino acid analysisresults of human hair, reported in the literature.2.2.1.1 Unaltered or “Virgin” Human Hair
2.2.1.1 Unaltered or “Virgin” Human HairUnaltered human hair is hair that has not been chemically modiﬁed by treatmentwith bleaches, permanent waves, straighteners, or hair dyes. Numerous publications[7,13–28] describe results of the amino acid analysis of unaltered human hair.Table 2.1depicts the structures for 22 amino acids that have been identiﬁed inhuman hair. Cysteic acid and other amino acids, derived from those amino acids ofTable 2.1, are also present in either weathered or cosmetically altered hair, seeTable 2.2. Table 2.3summarizes results from several sources describing quantita-tive whole ﬁber analyses of these 22 amino acids. These same amino acids areclassiﬁed according to functional group in Table 2.4.2.2 The Amino Acids and Proteins of Different Types of Hair 111
Note the high frequencies of hydrocarbon, hydroxyl, primary amide, and basicamino acid functions in addition to the relatively large disulﬁde content. The highfrequency of hydrocarbon-containing amino acids conﬁrms that hydrophobicinteractions play a strong role in the reactivity of hair toward cosmetic ingredients.Hydroxyl and amide groups interact through hydrogen bonding interactions, whilethe basic and carboxylic acid groups interact through hydrogen bonding and ionicbonding type interactions.Of particular note is the fact that most of these functional groups occur at higherfrequencies than the disulﬁde bond in hair. However, these frequencies are whole-ﬁber frequencies, therein assuming that hair is a homogeneous substrate. Thisassumption is certainly not the case, as subsequent sections of this Chapterdemonstrate.Table 2.3shows substantial variation in the quantities of some of the amino
acids, notably aspartic acid, proline, cystine, and serine, while considerably lessTable 2.3 Amino acids in whole unalteredahuman hair (micromoles per gram dry hair)Amino acid Reference [ 13] Reference [ 14] Other references1.

dispersion is indicated for valine, glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, leucine, andarginine.The following factors can produce differences in whole-ﬁber amino acid analy-sis results; genetics, weathering (primarily sunlight exposure), cosmetic treatment,experimental procedures, and diet (not normal diets of healthy individuals, butprotein deﬁcient diets).Marshall and Gillespie [ 29] proposed special mathematical relationshipsbetween cystine and leucine:– Leucine (residue %) ¼/C00.31/C2half-cystine (residue %) + 11.3 and betweencystine and proline to determine abnormal variations:– Proline (residue %) ¼0.26/C2half-cystine (residue %) + 3.8These relationships are based on the fact that leucine and cystine are common
components of the low sulfur proteins, while proline and cystine are primarycomponents of the high sulfur proteins. They further suggest that the cystinecontent should be about 17–18% and that large variations beyond the calculatedvalues for these three amino acids indicates some cause of variation such as genetic,environmental (sunlight exposure), cosmetic treatment, diet, etc. Variation fromthese factors is described next.2.2.1.2 Amino Acid Composition Related to GeneticsThe variation of cystine and cysteine in human hair has been studied extensively.Clay et al. [ 15] quantitatively analyzed hair from 120 different persons for cystineand cysteine (see Table 2.3). The hair in this study was selected from both malesand females of varying age and pigmentation. Analysis was by the hydrolyticTable 2.4 Approximate composition unaltered human hair by amino acid side-chain typeAmino acid side-chain typeaApproximate micromolesper gram hair1.Hydrocarbon (except phenylalanine) 2,800

method of Shinohara [ 30]. These results show a wide spread in disulﬁde contentvarying from 784 to 1,534 mmol half-cystine per gram of hair (8.7–17%); substan-tially different from the cystine level suggested by Marshall and Gillespie for“normal” hair. Signiﬁcantly more cystine was found in hair from males thanfemales. Also, dark hair generally contained more cystine than light hair. A similarrelationship between cystine content and hair color has been reported by Oguraet al. [ 31].No consistent relationship was found between age and cystine content. Althoughfactors such as diet (malnutrition), cosmetic treatment, and environmental effects(sunlight degradation) may have contributed to variation among these samples,such factors were not considered in this study.With regard to racial variation, nothing has been deﬁnitely established. Hawk’sdata [ 23] appears to show subtle differences in the relative percentages of various
amino acids found in the hydrolysates of African hair compared to Caucasian hair.Wolfram compiled a more complete set of data from the literature of whole-ﬁberamino acid analysis of the three major geo-racial groups, showing overlap in theamounts of all the amino acids from scalp hair for these three groups [ 32]. See thesection in Chap. 1entitled The Origin of Hair Fiber Curvature which explainsthe distribution and composition of different types of cortical cells in hair. Quanti-tative protein techniques in the section entitled Major Protein Fractions of Hair inthis Chapter and SNP analysis (Chap. 3) rather than amino acid analysis providesthe best means for determining the differences in the proteins of scalp hair ofdifferent geo-racial groups.2.2.1.3 Weathering of Human HairThe photochemical degradation of cystine (see Chap. 5) provides a major cause forvariation in this amino acid among different hair samples. Weathering effects [ 33]
in human hair may be explored by comparing tip ends (longer exposed) to rootends. In a study by Robbins, the cystine and cysteine contents of tip ends wereshown to be lower than in root ends [ 34]. Complementary to these results, largeramounts of cysteic acid have been reported in hydrolysates of tip ends of humanhair than in root ends [ 13]. Evidence for cysteic acid in weathered wool has alsobeen provided by Strasheim and Buijs by infrared spectroscopy [ 35] and for someSouth African Merino wools by Louw [ 36].These results suggest conversion of thioester and cystinyl groups in human hairto higher oxidation states by the elements. This conclusion is supported by the workof Harris and Smith [ 37], who determined that ultraviolet light disrupts the disulﬁdebond of dry wool. In another study, Robbins and Bahl [ 6] examined both the effects
of ultraviolet light on hair from root and tip sections from several persons usingelectron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) to examine different types ofsulfur in hair. Their data suggested that weathering of cystine in hair is primarily a114 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
photochemical reaction proceeding mainly through the C-S ﬁssion route producingcystine S-sulfonate residues as a primary end product. This reaction also occurs toa greater extent near the ﬁber surface showing that oxidation of thioester tosulfonate and loss of MEA also occurs by photochemical degradation. McMillenand Jachowicz [ 8] found that Tryptophan is sensitive to degradation by heat. It isalso sensitive to photochemical degradation. Signiﬁcantly lower quantities of thedibasic amino acids lysine and histidine have been reported in tip ends of humanhair compared to root ends [ 34].As indicated, for hair damaged by sunlight, in most cases, the amino acids of thecuticle are altered to a greater extent than those of the cortex because the outerlayers of the ﬁber receive higher intensities of radiation. Hair protein degradationby light radiation has been shown to occur primarily in the wavelength region of254–400 nm. More recent work by Hoting and Zimmerman [ 38] shows that the
proteins of the cuticle are degraded by UV-B and UV-A, but less by visible lightand that cystine, proline and valine are degraded more in light brown hair than inblack hair. In other words the photo-protective effect of melanin is much better indark hair than in light hair.Oxidation at the peptide backbone carbon has been shown to occur fromultraviolet exposure both in wool [ 39] and in hair [ 6,40], producing carbonyl(alpha keto amide intermediates as shown below) which are favored in the drystate reaction more than in the wet state. This reaction is similar to the oxidativedamage to proteins and mitochondrial decay associated with aging described byDean et al. [ 41] and described in detail in Chap. 5.R’-CH-CO-NH-CH-CO-NH- R-CO-CO-NH- +uv Alpha keto derivative (carbonyl)R’-CH -CO-NHAmideRThe photochemical breakdown of disulﬁd e bridges within structural units of
the A-layer and the exocuticle and matrix of the cortex and the establishment ofnew intra- and intermolecular cross-link s via reaction of these carbonyl groups(from uv degradation) with protein ami no groups (primarily lysine as shownbelow) within and between structural unit s decreases structural deﬁnition. Thesereactions most likely lead to a gradual increase in brittleness and a gradual loss ofstructural differentiation, see Chap. 5for details and micrographs that supportthese conclusions.2.2 The Amino Acids and Proteins of Different Types of Hair 115

In addition, methodsof analysis described in the literature have ranged from wet chemical [ 20], tochromatographic [ 13], to microbiological [ 18]. Reexamination of Table 2.3withthis latter condition in mind shows values for aspartic acid, proline, tyrosine, and
lysine as determined by the microbiological assay to be in relatively poor agree-ment with the other values for these same amino acids determined by wet chemicaland chromatographic procedures. In the case of valine, the values for the micro-biological and chromatographic procedures are in close agreement. This suggeststhat for certain of the amino acids (valine) the microbiological assay is satisfactory,whereas for other amino acids (aspartic acid, proline, tyrosine, and lysine), themicrobiological method is questionable.2.2.1.5 Stability of Hair KeratinSeveral years ago, a well-preserved cadaver was discovered by archaeologists in theHan Tomb No. 1 near Changsha, China [ 42]. In the casket, the occupant wore a wellpreserved hair piece that was more than 2,000 years old. Although this hair was notanalyzed for amino acid content, it was analyzed by x-ray diffraction by Kenney[42], revealing that the alpha-helical content had been well preserved. Nevertheless,
some minor disruption of the low ordered matrix had occurred owing to reactionwith a mercurial preservative in the casket. This suggests that the basic structure ofthe intermediate ﬁlaments of human hair remains unchanged over centuries and itsessential structural features are extraordinarily stable but the mercury preservativemay be reacting with cystine in the matrix.2.2.1.6 Cosmetically Altered HairBleached HairThe whole-ﬁber amino acid composition of human hair, bleached on the head withcommercial hair-bleaching agents – alkaline hydrogen peroxide or alkaline116 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
peroxide/persulfate [ 43] has been described in the literature [ 11]. This investigationdeﬁnes the amino acids found in hydrolysates of hair bleached to varying extents onthe head. Data describing frosted (extensively bleached hair using alkaline perox-ide/persulfate) vs. non-bleached hair from the same person, bleached on the headabout 1 month prior to sampling, are summarized in Table 2.5. These data show thatthe primary chemical differences between extensively bleached hair and unalteredhair are lower cystine content, a higher cysteic acid content, and lower amounts oftyrosine and methionine in the bleached hair. Mildly to moderately bleached hairshows only signiﬁcantly lower cystine and correspondingly more cysteic acid thanunaltered hair. These results support Zahn’s [ 44] original conclusion that thereaction of bleaching agents with human hair protein occurs primarily at thedisulﬁde bonds. Fewer total micromoles of amino acids per gram of hair are
found in bleached than in unaltered hair (see Table 2.5) most likely because ofaddition of oxygen to the sulfur containing amino acids and to solubilization ofprotein or protein derived species into the bleach bath [ 45].Products of disulﬁde oxidation, intermediate in oxidation state between cystineand cysteic acid (see Table 2.6), have been shown to be present in wool oxidized byaqueous peracetic acid [ 46–48]. These same cystine oxides have been demonstratedat low levels in bleached hair [ 49]; however, disulﬁde oxidation intermediates havenot been shown to exist in more than trace amounts in hair oxidized by currentlyused bleaching products [ 50].The actual presence of large amounts of cysteic acid in bleached hair had at onetime been in doubt [ 51,52]. It had been theorized that the cysteic acid found inTable 2.5 Amino acids from frosted vs. non-frosted hairAmino acid Micromoles per gram hairSigniﬁcant difference for

bleached hair hydrolysates was formed by decomposition of intermediate oxidationproducts of cystine during hydrolysis prior to the analytical procedure [ 51]. How-ever, differential infrared spectroscopy [ 5] and electron spectroscopy for chemicalanalysis by Robbins and Bahl [ 6] on intact un-hydrolyzed hair have conclusivelydemonstrated the existence of relatively large quantities of cysteic acid residues inchemically bleached hair. Evidence for other sulfur acids, e.g., sulﬁnic or sulfenicacids, in bleached hair has not been provided. Furthermore, it is unlikely that theseamino acids exist in high concentrations in hair, because they are relativelyunstable. For details concerning the mechanism of oxidation of sulfur in hair, seeChap. 5.Permanent-Waved HairNineteen amino acids in human hair have been studied for possible modiﬁcationduring permanent waving, that is all of the amino acids of Table 2.1except trypto-
phan, citrulline and ornithine. Signiﬁcant decreases in cystine (2–14%) andcorresponding increases in cysteic acid [ 2,11] and in cysteine [ 2]h a v eb e e nr e p o r t e dfor human hair that has been treated either on the head by home permanent-wavingproducts or in the laboratory by thioglycolic acid and hydrogen peroxide, in asimulated permanent-waving process.Trace quantities (less than 10 mmol/g) of thioacetylated lysine and sorbedthioglycolic acid have also been reported in human hair treated by cold-wavingreagents [ 2]. Small quantities of mixed disulﬁde [ 2,6], sorbed dithiodiglycolic acid[2], and methionine sulfone [ 11] have been found in hydrolyzates of hair treated bythe thioglycolate cold-waving process.NH2-CH-(CH2)4-NH-CO-CH2SH CH3SO2-CH2-CH2-CH-NH2CO2H CO2HThioacetylated lysine                   Methionine sulfoneNH2-CH-CH2-S-S-CH2-CO2H HOOC-CH2-S-S-CH2-COOHCO2HMixed disulfide Dithiodiglycolic acidTable 2.6 Some possibleoxidation products of the

Methionine sulfone is presumably formed by reaction of the neutralizer withmethionine residues; thioacetylated lyine is probably formed by reaction of lysinewith thioglycolide impurity in the thioglycolic acid [ 2]. The mixed disulﬁde ispresumably formed by displacement of thioglycolate on the cystine residues in hair(see Chap. 4for mechanistic details). One might also expect to ﬁnd trace quantitiesof methionine sulfoxide in hair; however, to date this sulfoxide has not beenreported.In alkaline media, the formation of lanthionine residues can also occur [ 53], seeChap. 4. Zahn et al. [ 54,55] reported that thioglycolate can accelerate the rate offormation of thioether residues (lanthionyl) in wool ﬁber. Therefore, one mightexpect to ﬁnd trace quantities of this amino acid in hair permanent-waved in analkaline medium. Chao et al. [ 56] demonstrated small quantities of lanthionine andcarboxymethyl thiocysteine (see Chap. 4) in hair reduced by thioglycolic acid.

Procedures that donot involve reduction of hair such as ninhydrin detection (alpha-amino group) ordinitroﬂuorobenzene (DNFB) reaction followed by chromatographic separation[1,54] discriminate between mercaptans and therefore should be better analyticalprocedures for detecting the different types of mercaptans and disulﬁdes actuallypresent in permanent waved hair.Hair Straightened with Alkaline StraightenersThe process of straightening hair with alkaline straighteners is described in Chap. 4
and as shown in that section, relatively large quantities of lanthionine(>100mmol/g) can be found in hair treated with these products that vary frompH 12 to above 13. Relatively large quantities of residues of the diacidic aminoacids of aspartic and glutamic acids resulting from the alkaline hydrolysis of thecorresponding amide residues would also be expected.2.2.1.7 Analysis of Acidic and Basic Groups in Whole Human HairBoth the acid-combining capacity [ 57,58] and the acid dye-combining capacity[34,59] of unaltered keratin ﬁbers have been used to estimate the frequency of basicgroups. Similarly, the base-combining capacity can be used to estimate the fre-quency of acidic groups in hair [ 57]. The acid-combining capacity of unaltered2.2 The Amino Acids and Proteins of Different Types of Hair 119
human hair ﬁbers is approximately 820 mmol/g [ 34,59,60]. This parameterprovides an estimate of the frequency of basic amino acid residues, includingN-terminal groups (approximately 15 mmol/g) [ 10,61] and sorbed alkaline matter,whereas the base-combining capacity provides an estimation of the titratable acidicgroups in the ﬁbers, including C-terminal amino acid residues and any sorbed acidicmatter.Alterations to the ﬁbers that affect the apparent frequency of acidic or basicgroups, such as hydrolysis, susceptibility to hydrolysis, or the introduction ofsulfonic acid groups [ 25], can affect the acid- and/or base-combining capacity ofhair. Therefore, permanent-waving and especially bleaching (oxidation) can affectthese titration parameters [ 11]. The effects of cosmetic treatments and environmenton these titration parameters are described in detail in Chap. 6.2.3 Aging Inﬂuences on HairAs a person ages, hormonal changes contribute to changes in the hair. The more
obvious changes are: Hair thickness (hair density or hairs/cm2), hair graying (seeChap. 7), hair diameter (ﬁne-coarseness) and dryness of the scalp and the hair. Hairthinning tends to relate to hair density and therefore to not to be noticeable inwomen until the mid to late twenties or more commonly a few years later, see Chap.1inHair Density versus Age for Caucasian Women . Large increases in hair ﬁberdiameter occur during the ﬁrst year in life and during the teenage years. Diametertends to peak at about age 20 for men and in the mid-forties for women, see Fig. 2.1.Figure 2.1shows a steeper drop for the scalp hair ﬁber diameter of Japanese malesvs. Caucasian males. This effect should be reexamined. Then, with increasing agehair ﬁber diameter decreases, see Chap. 9in the section entitled Fiber Diameter,Cross-sectional Area, Fine-coarse Hair and Age and Hair Growth and references[62–65].
[62–65].Fig. 2.1 The variation of hair ﬁber diameter with age and sex120 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
Graying of hair relates to the size and distribution of the melanin granules as wellas the types of pigments in the ﬁbers. Gray hair is also dependent on the productionof less pigment in the individual hairs with advancing age. It is usually associatedwith middle age; however, graying can begin in one’s early 20s. For more details onthe incidence of graying and the age that graying begins, see Chap. 7inGray Hairand Graying of Human Hair . The formation of hair pigments takes place in themelanocytes in the bulb of the follicle starting with the amino acid tyrosine asdescribed in Chap. 5inHair Pigment Structure and Chemical Oxidation . Grayingoccurs when the melanocytes become less active during anagen. The melaninpigments are incorporated into large granules that are transferred into the keratincells in the zone of keratinization, see Chap. 1.Hollfelder et al. [ 66] provided some evidence (from hair from only ﬁve
individuals) that gray hairs are coarser and wavier than heavily pigmented hairson the same person. Van Neste [ 67] found that white hairs are coarser thanpigmented hairs and that white hairs have more medulla. However, Gao and Bedell[68] studied gray and dark hairs from only four persons plus one sample of pooledgray hair. They found no signiﬁcant differences in the maximum center diameter,center ellipticity and cross-sectional areas of gray vs. dark hairs. See Chap. 5in thesection entitled Hair Pigment Structure and Chemical Oxidation for additionaldetails.Less pigmented hairs, such as gray hairs [ 68], blonde hair or bleached hairs are
also more sensitive to light radiation than heavily pigmented hairs. Therefore,lightly pigmented hairs exposed to ultraviolet radiation for a sufﬁcient period willshow lower levels of cystine and correspondingly higher levels of cysteic acidparticularly in their outer layers when compared to heavily pigmented hairs. Inaddition damage to the cell membrane complex and tryptophan and other aminoacids should occur at a faster rate in gray hair vs. heavily pigmented hairs. Suchexposed gray ﬁbers will also provide lower tensile stresses to achieve a given strainlevel in load-elongation tests and lower bending stiffness see Chap. 5inHairPigment Structure and Chemical Oxidation .Dryness/oiliness is another hair property associated with aging. There are two
primary sources of hair lipids: The sebaceous glands and the hair matrix cells.Sebaceous glands occur over most of the body where hair ﬁbers exist. These glandsexcrete their oils through the narrow opening of the hair follicle onto hair and skinsurfaces. The output of these glands is related to the size of the gland, age and sex.Prior to puberty, the output of these glands is low and the hair tends to be dry, seethe section entitled, Free Lipids in the Total Hair Fiber in this Chapter. Sebaceousoutput increases at puberty through the teenage years and into the second decade.With increasing age beyond the fourth decade, sebum output decreases, but more soin females than in males.Changes in the composition and amounts of hair lipids on and in the ﬁbers, lowerscalp hair density, lower growth rates and lower hair ﬁber diameters occur withadvancing age. These changes affect important hair properties beyond the mid-
forties especially for women because these effects are exacerbated by menopause2.3 Aging Inﬂuences on Hair 121
when hair lipid changes have been shown to make hair on the head less greasy ordrier, see The effects of Menopause on the Lipids in Hair and on the Hair Fiber,described later in this Chapter. A decrease in softness and smoothness of the hair ofpost-menopausal women has also been reported.It is also likely that hair curvature increases with advancing age as has beenshown for Japanese women see Chap. 10in the section entitled Hair Handle orFeel. This effect will likely make the hair ﬁbers more prone to frizziness and willdecrease hair luster as shown for Japanese hair.The effects of these age related changes in hair density, diameter or area ofcross-section, graying, curvature and hair lipids produce changes in ﬁber propertieswhich produce changes in important consumer hair assembly properties such as achanges in combing ease, hair body, hair coverage, frizziness, manageability, styleretention, etc. which are described in detail in the last section of Chap. 10.
Aging of individual hair ﬁbers on one’s head by everyday grooming actionsgenerally results in a gradual degradation of the scales through cuticle fragmenta-tion. This process is related to the actual age or time the individual hair has been onthe scalp (or its residence time) rather than to the chronological age of the individ-ual and is described in detail in Chap. 6.2.4 Chemical Composition of the Different MorphologicalComponents2.4.1 CuticleBradbury et al. [ 17] suggested that the cuticle of human hair contains morecystine, cysteic acid, proline, serine, thr eonine, isoleucine, methionine, leucine,tyrosine, phenylalanine, and arginine t han whole ﬁber. Data calculated fromBradbury’s results and those of Robbins [ 13]o nw h o l eh u m a nh a i rﬁ b e r sa r esummarized in Table 2.7. Wolfram and Lindemann et al. [ 69] described compar-ative cuticle and cuticle-free hair analy ses of certain amino acids in human hair
and their data are qualitativel y similar to those of Bradbury [ 17]( s e eT a b l e 2.7).In addition, these authors suggested less t ryptophan and histidine in cuticle than inwhole ﬁber.In general, these results show that cuticular cells contain a higher percentage ofthe amino acids that are not usually found in alpha-helical polypeptides than isfound in whole ﬁber. Small amounts of citrulline (11 mmol/g) have been reported inwhole human hair ﬁbers, whereas cuticle is found to be somewhat richer incitrulline (45 mmol/g) with only trace quantities of ornithine (5 mmol/g) [ 17].The three major layers of the hair cuticle, A-layer, the exocuticle andendocuticle, have been separated after enzymatic digestion and analyzed [ 72].Their chemical compositions are quite different and are described next.122 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
2.4.1.1 A-LayerThe A-Layer was ﬁrst discovered and named by Rogers [ 71] in 1959. It liesimmediately beneath the epicuticle cell membrane. It is of relatively uniformthickness (~110 nm). Varying data have been published about its compositiondue to contamination arising from the difﬁculty to separate it from adjacent layersof the ﬁber, the cell membrane and the exocuticle. Swift [ 73] reported a very highhalf cystine content for the A-layer at approximately one half-cystine in every 2.7amino acid residues or about 37 mol% half cystine an exceedingly high cystinecontent.The A-layer is the most highly cross-linked region of the hair ﬁber being cross-linked by both cystine (disulﬁde) bonds and isopeptide (amide) groups formedbetween glutamine and lysine by a transglutaminase enzyme [ 74]. Isopeptide cross-
links (sometimes called isodipeptide) are veriﬁed by the resistance of the A-layer tosolubilization by reaction of a reducing agent (generally a mercaptan) in theTable 2.7 Amino acid composition of the different morphological components of hairaAmino acid CuticlebWhole ﬁbercMedulladAspartic acid 287 449 470Threonine 524 664 140Serine 1,400 1,077 270Glutamic acid 819 1,011 2,700Proline 994 667 160Glycine 611 485 300Alanine – 374 400Half-cystine 2,102 1,461 TraceValine 634 499 320Methionine 38 53 40Isoleucine 184 249 130Leucine 418 516 700Tyrosine 132 184 320Phenylalanine 91 142 –Cysteic acid 68 29 –Lysine – 217 740Histidine – 71 100Arginine 360 529 180Ammonia – – (700)Citrulline 45 11 –aData are expressed in micromoles amino acid per gram dry hairbThe data for cuticle analysis are based on the work of Bradbury et al. [ 17] who analyzed cuticleand whole ﬁber from several keratin sources, including human hair, merino wool, mohair, and
alpaca. These scientists concluded that there is very nearly the same difference between the aminoacid composition of the cuticle and each of these ﬁbers from which it was derived. They listed theaverage percentage differences used in these calculations. More recent analyses of cuticle andwhole ﬁber of human hair [ 69,70] are in general agreement with these data [ 17]cWhole-ﬁber results approximated by cortex analysis [ 13]dThese data are results of analysis of medulla derived from porcupine quill from Rogers [ 71]2.4 Chemical Composition of the Different Morphological Components 123
presence of a detergent solution. Generally, most proteinaceous systems that arecross-linked by disulﬁde bonds alone are readily solubilized by such a medium, butproteinaceous tissues that are cross-linked by isopeptide bonds are not readilydissolved by a reducing medium [ 75]. Furthermore, isopeptide bonds are alsoresistant to many enzymes that readily attack peptide bonds.In this author’s opinion, the most relia b l ee s t i m a t ef o rt h ea m i n oa c i dc o m p o -sition of the A-layer is the one by Bringans et al. [ 76]s u m m a r i z e di nT a b l e 2.8.Bringans et al. isolated their A-layer by e ssentially dissolving the rest of the ﬁberfrom it. They took Merino wool and scoured it, then solvent extracted it followedby methanolic KOH treat ment to remove the MEA layer. The next step was totreat with reducing conditions using tris-2 carboxy ethyl phosphine followedby treatment with pronase E for 7 days. At va rious stages of treatment the sample
was examined by TEM to estimate what structures were remaining in it. Thecomposition of the remaining matter was largely A-layer containing only 3%lysine which at 50% conversion to isopeptide would provide only 1.5 mol%isopeptide bonding. This amount of isopeptide is somewhat lower than theestimate of 2.5 mol% suggested by Zahn et al. [ 77]. Bringans et al. [ 76]t h e ndigested the remaining A-layer with 2-nitr o-5-thiocyano-benzoic acid to producea large number of small peptide derivatives that were analyzed by mass spec-trometry. A large proportion of the peptide derivatives ﬁt the cuticular KAP 5 andKAP 10 families of proteins known to be in hair cuticle in large amounts. Inaddition, there was also strong homology to the KAP 4 and KAP 12 familiesof proteins. See the section entitled The KAP Proteins of Human Hair in thisChapter.Table 2.8 Approximatecomposition of the A-layerfrom Merino wool byBringans et al.

2.4.1.2 ExocuticleBradbury and Ley [ 78] provided an amino acid analysis of exocuticle derived fromphysically isolated cuticle cells of wool ﬁber after pronase and trypsin digestion.This approach provided 20% cystine, about 10% acidic amino acids, about 7%basic amino acids and about 44% non-polar amino acids, see Table 2.9.Swift [ 79] cited approximately 20% cystine in an exocuticle rich fraction fromhuman hair, although the data showed a slightly higher amount which Swiftattributes to exocuticle plus A-layer [ 72,79]. Swift [ 72,79] also indicated thatthe exocuticle likely contains virtually no isopeptide cross-links because of its rapiddigestion in dithiothreitol/papain mixture, a medium that only slowly attacks theadjacent A-layer of hair. The exocuticle has been described by Swift as varyingfrom 100 to 300 nm thick [ 73,79] within the same cuticle cell and it averages about200 nm thick.The sequences of three mid-cuticle proteins have been described by M.L. Rogers
et al. in several different publications and these contain about 20–22% cystine [ 80].2.4.1.3 EndocuticleThe endocuticle of human hair has been shown by Swift [ 79] to be irregular inshape and varies from about 50 to 300 nm thick and averages about 175 nm.Relatively similar amino acid compositions have been reported for endocuticlefrom wool ﬁber by Bradbury and Ley [ 78] and from human hair by Swift and Bews[72], see the data of Table 2.10.Swift and Bews [ 72] isolated three chemically distinct protein fractions all oflow cystine content. These proteins were all easily digested by protease systems notTable 2.9 Amino acidcomposition of exocuticleof wool ﬁber by Bradburyand Ley [ 78]Amino acid Mole percentAspartic acid 2.1Glutamic acid 8.6Threonine 3.9Serine 11.9Proline 12.4Glycine 8.7Alanine 6.4Valine 8.2Isoleucine 2.9Leucine 4.6Half cystine + cysteic acid 20.0Methionine 0.2Tyrosine 2.0Phenylalanine 1.2Histidine 0.5

containing reducing agents suggesting a lack of or relatively low levels of bothdisulﬁde and virtually no isopeptide cross-links. The low level of cross-links andthe relatively high levels of polar (acidic and basic) amino acid residues suggest thatthis layer of cuticle cells is the one most prone to a high degree of swelling in water.Thus, the proteins of the exocuticle and its A-layer are highly cross-linked bycystine (more than 30% combined exocuticle and A-layer) and therefore extremelytough and resilient. In contrast, the proteins of the endocuticle contain very littlecystine (~3%) and relatively large amounts of the dibasic and diacidic amino acids.As a result of these large compositional differences in the A-layer, exocuticleand the endocuticle, the cuticle can be expected to react differently to permanentwaves, bleaches, and even to water and surfactants. Roper et al. [ 81] described a
method to determine the cuticle composition from endocuticle of chemicallytreated wools. Such a procedure should be useful to evaluate changes in theendocuticle of cosmetically modiﬁed human hair.2.4.2 Proteins of the Cell Membrane ComplexThe structures of the three different types of cell membrane complex (CMC) aredescribed in Chap. 1in the section entitled, Structure of the Three Different CellMembrane Complexes .The schematic of Fig. 1.44 depicts cell membrane proteins and multiple layersof proteins in the Delta layer of the cuticle-cuticle CMC analogous to the Deltalayer of the cortex-cortex CMC depicted in Fig. 1.45 [82,83].

composition of the proteins of the CMC are still not adequately characterized. Thereason for this gap is that it is extremely difﬁcult to isolate proteins from only thecell membranes or only the Delta layer. This difﬁculty has been the primaryobstacle to our understanding the composition and structure of the proteins of thisimportant region of the ﬁber. Much more scientiﬁc attention has been given to theanalysis of cuticle cell membranes than to those of the cortex therefore I will beginthis discussion on the proteins in the cuticle cell membranes.2.4.2.1 Proteins in the Cuticle Cell MembranesThe proteins of the cuticle cell membranes are associated with the Allwordenreaction [ 84] as described earlier. The membranous epicuticle supports 18-MEA
and is attached to the A-layer on the top of cuticle cells and has been isolated byshaking animal hair ﬁbers during Allworden sac formation and subsequentlyanalyzed for amino acids. Perhaps the most quoted and “reliable” amino acidanalysis of the Allworden membrane has been provided by Allen and coworkers[85] and is summarized in Table 2.11. The proteins in the cuticle cell membranesare described in detail in Chap. 1in the section entitled The Structures of the ThreeDifferent Cell Membrane Complexes , where these leading references are cited [ 84,85,87–96]. See that section and those references for details.Table 2.11 Amino acidsfrom the proteins exractedfrom wool with performicacid [ 86] vs. Allwordenmembrane [ 85]Amino acid Allworden [ 85] Resistant membranes [ 86]Asp 3 5.4Glu 8.6 10.3Thr 2.1 5.7Ser 14.3 10Tyr 0 0Pro 4.2 7.1Gly 23.8 14.2Ala 3.2 6.5Val 5.6 4.9Iso 1.2 2.6Leu 2.9 4.9Trp – 0Phe 0.4 1.5His 0.2 1.3Lys 4.5 8.4Arg 2.5 4.2Met 0 0Cys 21.1 13

2.4.2.2 Proteins in the Cortical Cell MembranesProteinaceous material called “resistant membranes” have been isolated from boththe oxidation of wool and or hair with performic or peracetic acid followed bytreatment with either ammonia or alkaline urea [ 86]. The authors of this paper statethat this material from the performic acid reaction is similar to their own analysis ofAllworden membrane. However, both are clearly different from the Allwordenmembrane analysis by Allen et al. [ 85] as summarized in Table 2.11.Treatment of keratin ﬁbers with either peracetic or performic acid and separationinto three fractions according to solubility has been called the “keratose” method byAlexander and Earland [ 97]. Some additional material on this method is describedlater in this Chapter in the section entitled, Other Fractionation Methods . Afteroxidation, adjustment of the pH to the alkaline side provides an insoluble fraction
called Beta-keratose, about 10% of the weight of the hair. Acidiﬁcation to pH 4provides a fraction greater than 50% of the material called Alpha-keratosecontaining crystalline material, by x-ray diffraction. The third fraction calledGamma-keratose is believed to be largely from the matrix. The Beta-keratosefraction is believed to be proteins derived primarily from cell membrane material;however other proteins are likely present. According to a different workup proce-dure by Bradbury, Leeder and Watt [ 86], only 1–1.55% residue is provided. Otherworkup procedures have been applied to the keratose method [ 98].Since the cell membrane lipids of cortical cells are not bound by thioester
linkages as in cuticle cells, but by polar and ionic bonds, then no UHSP is necessaryfor the cell membrane proteins of cortical cells, but proteins with an adequatenumber of basic sites such as amino and guanidino (for bonding to cholesterolsulfate and to fatty acids) and polar sites such as carboxyl and hydroxyl groupswould also be preferred for polar bonding to fatty acids and hydroxyl groups. Thecortical cell membranes will most likely be resistant to oxidation, reduction and toacids and alkalies. Therefore, isopeptide bonds will be necessary and these could beformed by proteins such as involucrin and small proline rich proteins that are richsources of glutamine to react with lysine groups of other proteins as in stratumcorneum and in the cuticle cell membranes [ 85].The resistant membrane material from the reaction of performic acid on woolﬁber by Bradbury, Leeder and Watt [ 86] provides only about 62% of the amount of
cystine as the composition of the Allworden membrane by Allen et al. [ 85]. It alsocontains about twice the basic amino acid content and basic amino acids arenecessary to form salt linkages to cholesterol sulfate and carboxyl groups of fattyacids to form bilayers for cortical cell membranes. Performic acid derived mem-brane matter should be richer in cortical cell membranes, since they are a higherpercentage of the total membrane matter in keratin ﬁbers. However, other proteincontaminants could be from the A-layer and cuticle cell membranes which alsocontain isopeptide bonds.A cleaner experimental scheme to isolate pure cortical cell membranes would beto start with pure cortex to exclude cuticle cell membranes and A-layer proteins.Pure cortex from human hair could be provided by the glass ﬁber method of128 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
Wortmann et al. [ 99] and then perhaps employ the performic acid reaction oranother scheme to provide cortical cell membranes in the absence of cuticle con-tamination for further workup and analysis.2.4.2.3 Proteins Extracted from Hair/Wool Believed to be from the CMCLeeder and Marshall [ 100] extracted Merino wool with formic acid and also withn-propanol/water (50/50). Proteinaceous matter was removed from the hair ﬁberswith each of these solvent systems. With formic acid, these scientists concluded thatthe proteins were at least partially derived from the CMC, most likely the Deltalayer because the extract contained virtually no cystine. If this proteinaceousmaterial is from the Delta layer it most likely is not from the central proteins,called the contact zone, because Naito et al. [ 101] provided evidence that the centralcontact zone contains hydrophilic protein with disulﬁde bonding.Leeder and Marshall [ 100] concluded that the proteins derived from their
propanol/water extraction of wool is not entirely from the cell membrane complex,but these proteins also contain high glycine-tyrosine proteins possibly from thecortex. The amino acid compositions of proteins extracted by formic acid, byn-propanol/water and by chloroform/methanol are compared with that of Allwordenmembrane in Table 2.12.Logan et al. [ 102] demonstrated that a chloroform-methanol azeotropic mixtureprovides a very different mixture of proteins than the high temperature propanol/Table 2.12 Proteins extracted from wool with formic acid and n-propanol water compared withAllworden membraneAmino acid Allworden [ 85] Formic acid [ 100] n-Propanol [ 100] CHCl3/MeOH [ 102]Asp 3.0 5.7 3.7 6.2Glu 8.6 7.2 2.4 7.5Thr 2.1 3.8 3.2 5.1Ser 14.3 8.1 11.7 13.3Tyr 0 12.0 16.4 3.0Pro 4.2 4.0 5.2 6.4Gly 23.8 19.2 25.0 11.9Ala 3.2 5.2 2.2 8.0Val 5.6 4.2 2.8 5.9Iso 1.2 3.3 0.8 3.5Leu 2.9 9.2 6.1 8.1Trp 0 0 – –Phe 0.4 5.2 7.8 3.6His 0.2 1.2 0.7 1.0

water extraction, see Table 2.12. Could this chloroform-methanol extract be par-tially derived from cortical cell membranes or part of the outer lamella (outermostlayer) of the Delta layer proteins of the CMC? Since Mansour and Jones [ 103]demonstrated that chloroform/methanol provides large changes to the cortex-cortexCMC in wool, it is likely that the proteins removed by chloroform/methanol are atleast partially attached to Beta layers and are at least in part Delta layer proteins ofthe cortex-cortex CMC.The method of Swift and Holmes [ 104] has been used by several differentresearchers to obtain proteinaceous matter believed to be partially derived fromthe CMC. This method involves dissolving matter from hair using papain with areducing agent such as bisulﬁte or dithiothreitol (DTT). Bryson (Bryson W. Privatecommunication) conducted a series of experiments from which he concluded that
the laminated structure observed under the TEM following a 72 h digestion of woolﬁbers with papain and reducing solution (somewhat standard procedure) is notderived entirely from the CMC. Prolonging the digestion beyond 72 h increased thenumber of laminated layers beyond what could be accounted for by the number ofcortical cells in a ﬁber cross-section. Bryson concluded that the CMC lipids wererearranging with other proteins and peptides to form these laminated layers.Mass spectrometric analysis of the proteins of the digestion residue indicatedthat the majority of the protein component was papain, suggesting that the CMClipids had rearranged with papain to form the laminated structures. Therefore,Bryson concluded it is not possible to isolate pure proteinaceous CMC by papaindigestion. These conclusions by Bryson are consistent with those of Swift and Bews[72] who concluded that although treatments of keratin ﬁbers with enzymes and
reducing agents do cause separation of cells they could ﬁnd no evidence ofdissolution of the cuticle CMC via critical electron microscopic examination oftreated hair sections. Therefore the value of this method for isolation of CMCproteins is limited because of contamination with papain.2.4.3 Lipids of the Cell Membrane Complex2.4.3.1 Methods to Remove Lipids from Animal Hairs for AnalysisTo remove external lipids, wool ﬁbers are normally cleaned by scouring with anonionic agent such as Lissapol and then in scientiﬁc studies treated with one ormore solvents to remove any remaining external lipids. Non-swelling and/orsolvents of bulky molecules (like t-butyl alcohol [ 105]) have been used to removeexternal lipids from keratin ﬁbers, that is, lipids that are believed to be soil and notpart of the structural lipids of animal hairs. Solvents such as hexane, t-butyl alcoholor heptane and sometimes t-butanol and heptane sequentially [ 102,106] have been
used to extract external lipids such as wool wax or sebaceous matter from animalhairs. Such lipids are sometimes called external, extrinsic or even exogenous [ 107]and are not believed to be involved in the intercellular structure of animal hairs.130 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
In the case of human hair, external lipids have been removed by shampoo orsodium lauryl sulfate washing, the safest procedure, or by a combination ofshampoo followed by incubation in hexane for only 5 min [ 107] or in some casesother non-swelling solvents like ether or heptane which most likely do not removesigniﬁcant amounts of internal hair lipids.2.4.3.2 Removal of Internal Lipids Not Covalently Bound to HairHair-swelling organic solvents alone or in combination with a second lipid solventare used to remove internal lipids that are part of the internal structure of hair ﬁbers(of the CMC) but not covalently bonded to hair protein structures. Swelling solventssuch as chloroform/methanol [ 102,108], methanol [ 108], ethanol [ 104], formic acid[109], n-propanol/water [ 109]o ra c e t o n e[ 108] have been used to extract internalmatter from animal hairs. The most frequently used solvent for removal of internal
lipids has been chloroform/methanol (70/30) although other mixtures have been used.Normally soxhlet extraction is employed; however, multiple room temperatureextractions have also been used [ 107]. Although formic acid and n-propanol/water(generally 1:1) do remove some internal lipids these two solvents also remove somehair proteins of the CMC (most likely from the Delta layers and possibly from otherregions of the ﬁbers see the section entitled, Proteins of the CMC ).2.4.3.3 Removal of Covalently Bound Hair Lipids Plus SaltsInsoluble in Lipid SolventsAlkaline hydrolysis or methanolic alkali is used to remove covalently bound hair
lipids. This technique can be used to remove total hair lipids, but is generally usedafter extraction of external and internal lipids that are not covalently bound to theﬁbers. Those covalently bound lipids at or near the ﬁber surface are generallyremoved with potassium t-butoxide in t-butanol (bulky cleaving agent in a bulkysolvent) [ 110]. Total covalently bound lipids are generally removed with potassiumhydroxide in methanol because alkali in a swelling organic solvent like methanolpenetrates well into hair.In addition to covalently bound lipids, Wertz [ 111] suggested that salts ofcholesterol sulfate bind ionically to cationic groups of the hair proteins and willbe insoluble in chloroform/methanol. Therefore these ionically bound hair lipidswill remain in the ﬁbrous residue after extraction with organic solvents. Korneret al. [ 112] used a solution of chloroform/methanol/aqueous potassium chloride toextract CMC lipids from wool and human hair.
extract CMC lipids from wool and human hair.2.4.3.4 Total Lipids in Hair FibersThe total amount of lipid extractable from hair is generally 1–9% of the weight ofthe hair [ 107,113]. Masukawa et al. [ 107] studied the total hair lipid composition2.4 Chemical Composition of the Different Morphological Components 131
from 44 Japanese females ages 1 to 81. The lipids were extracted/removed fromhair in varying procedures to allow for analysis of several lipids and covalentlybound 18-MEA. Total fatty acids and 18-MEA were determined, but other impor-tant fatty acids both covalently bound and non-covalently bound were notquantitated such as palmitic, stearic, oleic and palmitoleic acids which have beenfound in signiﬁcant quantities in other studies [ 102,111,114–116]. Cholesterolsulfate was also not determined in this effort by Mazukawa et al.Logan et al. [ 102] analyzed human hair by extracting it with a chloroform/methanol azeotrope for 5 h after surface lipids had been removed with t-butanol andheptanes. These scientists found 23% palmitic, 25% palmitoleic, 4% stearic, 13%oleic and other fatty acids. These are all non-covalently bound fatty acids with 39%of the total fatty acids being unsaturated (primarily palmitoleic and oleic).
Although, it is possible other unsaturated fatty acids were present. Weitkampet al. [ 117] analyzed solvent extracted lipids from pooled adult Caucasian humanhair clippings and found 51% of the total fatty acids to be unsaturated withpalmitoleic and oleic acids as the principal unsaturated fatty acids. However,other unsaturated fatty acids were found in these extracts.Masukawa et al. [ 107] initially shampooed the hair and then washed it withhexane allowing a 5 min incubation time. The hexane wash was determined byplotting the amount of lipid extracted vs. the square root of time of the hexane wash.The time that diffusion of lipids from the interior of the ﬁber began was determinedgraphically, a reasonable approach to removing external lipid soils from the ﬁbersand leaving most of the internal and structural lipids in the hair.Mazukawa et al. then removed the hair lipids by extraction with different ratios
of chloroform-methanol and separated them into eight groups; their data aresummarized in Table 2.13. These data show that approximately 58% of the totallipids removed from hair under these conditions are fatty acids, some are covalentlybonded, but others exist as free and non-covalently bound fatty acids.

acids found were 14.4 mg/g of hair, but only 0.3 mg/g hair of 18-MEA were found.Wertz and Downing [ 111] found 1.31–2.1 mg/g of 18-MEA in four different humanhair samples (three from individuals and one pooled hair sample presumably Cauca-sian hair). In a later paper, Wertz and Downing [ 115] cited 4.0 mg/g total integral(covalently bound) fatty acids with 40.5% as 18-MEA for human hair or 1.6 mg/g18-MEA. Since most 18-MEA estimates in wool ﬁber are close to 1 mg/g or higherand human hair contains more cuticle layers than wool ﬁber one would expect morecovalently bound fatty acids in human hair than wool ﬁber. Masukawa did not listamounts for total covalently bound fatty acids only 18-MEA. Therefore I listed andused the data for Wertz and Downing [ 115] for total covalently bound fatty acids.2.4.3.5 Lipids of the Cuticle-Cuticle Cell Membrane ComplexWertz and Downing [ 115] examined ﬁve different mammalian hairs from sheep,
humans, dog, pig and cow and found the percentage of 18-MEA relative to the totalamount of covalently bound fatty acids varied from 38% to 48%. Table 2.14summarizes a tabulation of analyses of the covalently bound lipids of wool andhuman hair from several different laboratories. These results were all obtained afterthe ﬁbers had been exhaustively extracted with chloroform/methanol to remove thenon-covalently bound fatty acids and then the residue saponiﬁed with methanolicalkali showing that 18-MEA accounts for about 50% of the covalently bound fattyacids in these wool ﬁbers and about 40% in human hair.2.4.3.6 Covalently Bound Internal Lipids of Animal HairsKorner and G. Wortmann [ 119] (Table 2.14), analyzed covalently bound fatty acidsin isolated wool cuticle and found 55% 18-MEA, 25% stearic and 20% palmiticacid with “only traces of other straight and odd number carbon chain fatty acids.”For wool ﬁber Wertz and Downing [ 115] found 48% 18-MEA and 17% palmitic
acid, 10% stearic acid, 5% oleic acid and the remaining covalently bound fatty acidsranged from C16 through C20 with 6% uncharacterized. For human hair, Wertz andDowning [ 111] found 41% 18-MEA, 18%, palmitic acid, 7% stearic acid, 4% oleicTable 2.14 Covalently bound fatty acids in wool and human hair ﬁberFatty acid Data for wool ﬁberData for human hair[114][ 118][ 116][ 115][ 119] Averages [ 111]16:0 8 11 8 17 20 12.8 1818:0 8 12 6 10 25 12.2 718:1 785505 4MEA 51 43 72 48 55 53.8 41Others 26 26 9 20 Trace 16.4 30Data are expressed in percentages2.4 Chemical Composition of the Different Morphological Components 133
acid and the remaining small percentages of fatty acids from C16 through C20 with9% uncharacterized. Negri et al. [ 116] found 72% 18-MEA, 8% palmitic acid, 6%stearic acid and 5% oleic acid in wool ﬁber.The variation in these data from different laboratories is quite large. Part of thevariance has been suggested to be related to ﬁber diameter which determines thenumber of layers of covalently bound fatty acids in the ﬁbers. However, certainlypart of the variance is due to experimental error. The bottom line is that somewherein the vicinity of 50 /C6at least 10% of the covalently bound fatty acids in mostkeratin ﬁbers is 18-MEA and that hair ﬁbers from sheep, humans, dog, pig andcattle and likely most keratin ﬁbers contain palmitic, stearic and oleic with otherfatty acids as the remaining covalently bound fatty acids.In 1990, Kalkbrenner et al. [ 120] demonstrated with isolated cuticle cells that
18-MEA is essentially all in the cuticle. 18-MEA represents more than 40% of thetotal covalently bound fatty acids in human hair and about 50% in wool ﬁber. 18-MEA is conﬁned to the upper Beta layer of the cuticle [ 121,122] while most(essentially an amount equal to the 18-MEA) of the other covalently bound fattyacids are conﬁned to the lower Beta layer. Therefore, most of the covalently boundfatty acids in wool and hair ﬁber must be in the cuticle-cuticle CMC with some inthe cuticle-cortex CMC (to be described later) and virtually none in the cortex-cortex CMC. So, if most of the covalently bound fatty acids are in the cuticle-cuticle CMC, then most of the lipids of the cortex-cortex CMC must be bound to themembranes on one side and to the Delta layer on the other by non-covalent bonds.The fact that most of the remaining lipids can be removed by solvent extractionconﬁrms that this is the case.Leeder, Bishop and Jones [ 123] ﬁrst found that there are virtually no
phospholipids in keratin ﬁbers. This fact was conﬁrmed by Schwan and Zahn[124] and by Rivett [ 125] casting doubt on whether lipid bi-layers could beinvolved in the cell membranes of keratin ﬁbers [ 123]. However, Wertz et al.[126] demonstrated that liposomes (lipid bi-layers and a presumed precursor tothe formation of lipid bi-layers in the CMC of keratin ﬁbers) can form in theabsence of phospholipids if an acid species such as cholesterol sulfate is presentwith other lipids. Furthermore, evidence has been provided conﬁrming the exis-tence of cholesterol sulfate in human hair by Wertz and Downing [ 111] and byKorner et al. in wool ﬁber [ 112].The work of Korner et al. [ 112] builds upon the ﬁndings of Wertz et al. onliposome formation and lipids from stratum corneum [ 126]. Korner et al. [ 112]
demonstrated that cell membrane lipids extracted from human hair and wool ﬁberwith chloroform/methanol/aqueous potassium chloride can form liposomes. Thisresult provided evidence for a bi-layer structure of the internal lipids of the Betalayers of the cortical CMC in wool ﬁber and in human hair, see Fig. 1.45. Suchextracts must come primarily from the cortex-cortex CMC because covalentlybound MEA and the other covalently bound lipids of the cuticle CMC are notremoved with this solvent system.Therefore, if the Beta layers of the cuticle cells are primarily covalently boundfatty acids with some free lipids (see Fig. 1.44) and the Beta layers of cortical cells134 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
consist primarily of lipid bi-layers (Fig. 1.45), then it is highly likely that theproteins that these very different lipid layers are attached to are also different.These proteins are the cell membrane proteins and the Delta layer proteins of thecuticle cells and the cortical cells, see the section on Proteins of the CMC and thenext section of this Chapter .2.4.3.7 Lipids of the Cortex-Cortex Cell Membrane ComplexSince Mazukawa et al. [ 107] found 14.3 mg/g total fatty acid, but did not determinethe total covalently bound fatty acids, and Wertz and Downing found 4 mg/g totalcovalently bound fatty acids then the Mazukawa et al. data most likely represents oris closer to the total amount of non-covalently bound fatty acids in human hair. So,if we assume human hair has approximately 14 mg/g of non-covalently bound fattyacids and about ½ the equivalent amount of free lipid in the cuticle relative tocovalently bound fatty acid. This provides 2 mg/g free fatty acid in cuticle layers,
leaving about 12 mg/g of non-covalently bound fatty acids. If we assume 2 mg/gfatty acid as intracellular lipid that leaves 10 mg/g fatty acids in the cortex-cortexCMC. So, with these approximations, about 10 mg/g of fatty acids will exist in the“bi-layers” of the CMC of the cortex, along with cholesterol, cholesterol sulfate andceramide (see Fig. 1.45).Wertz and Downing [ 115] found cholesterol (0.6 mg/g), and cholesterol sulfate(2.9 mg/g) and ceramides (0.5 mg/g) in their alkaline hydrolysates from human hairafter removal of all free lipids by chloroform-methanol extraction. These samescientists also found these same lipid components in hair from sheep, dog, pig, cowand humans varying from (0.3 to 1.4 mg/g) cholesterol, ceramides (0.6 to 1.4 mg/g)and cholesterol sulfate (0.7 to 3.3 mg/g) [ 115].Examination of these data from different laboratories suggests the following
ingredients in these approximate ratios as the principal components of the bi-layersof the cortex-cortex CMC for human hair:Lipid component Approximate amount Approximate relative amountsFatty acids 10 mg/g hair 10Cholesterol sulfate 0.7–3.3 mg/g 2Cholesterol 0.6–1.2 mg/g 1Ceramides 0.6–1.4 mg/g 1These ratios are clearly not exact, but they show a large amount of fatty acidfollowed by cholesterol sulfate and smaller amounts of cholesterol and ceramide.2.4.3.8 Lipids of the Cuticle-Cortex Cell Membrane ComplexIf the cuticle-cortex CMC is a hybrid of the cuticle-cuticle CMC and the cortex-cortex CMC the composition of the lipids and the proteins should be essentially a50/50 mixture of the proteins of the cuticle-cuticle CMC and the cortex-cortex CMC.2.4 Chemical Composition of the Different Morphological Components 135
2.4.3.9 Lipids of the SurfaceThese lipids are essentially those covalently attached to the epicuticle such as 18-MEA and those free lipids that are associated with 18-MEA and the epicuticleproteins.2.4.3.10 After Shampooing an Appreciable Amount of Free LipidRemains in the Hair SurfaceShaw [ 127] suggested that washing hair with ether or shampoos in a one-stepapplication leaves virtually the entire hair surface free of lipid and that differencesin cleaning efﬁciencies of surfactants relate to the amounts of internal lipidremoved. Recent XPS data show that shampooing does remove some free-lipidfrom the surface of hair, but even after shampooing an appreciable amount of free-lipid remains in the surface layers, that is in the top 3 nm [ 128].2.4.3.11 Free-Lipid in Surface Layers Affects Isoelectric Pointof Wool and HairCapablanca and Watt [ 129] examined wool ﬁber that had been washed with
detergent (Lissapol) and extracted with various solvents using a streaming potentialmethod to estimate the effect of free-lipid (including non-covalently bound fattyacids) in the surface layers on the isoelectric point of wool ﬁber. These scientistsfound an appreciable effect of free-lipid on the isoelectric point. The surfactantwashed wool (containing the most free-lipid) provided an isoelectric point of 3.3.The isoelectric point of wool increased as the effectiveness of the solvent systemincreased with the most effective lipid solvent providing an isoelectric point of 4.5.These data show that free fatty acids in the surface layers are an important andessential component of the surface of animal hairs and about half of the free lipid isfatty acid [ 130]. So, the more free-lipid present in these surface layers, the lower the
isoelectric point of keratin ﬁbers. Therefore, all free-lipid is not totally removed andshould not be totally removed from the surface layers by shampooing of hair orscouring of wool ﬁber. In addition, free fatty acids are important to the isoelectricpoint of animal hair ﬁbers. Furthermore, the amount of free-lipid in the surface ofhair ﬁbers will inﬂuence hair friction, surface energy and a whole range of impor-tant properties including the adsorption of surfactants and other ingredients ontohuman hair and wool ﬁbers.Hoting and Zimmerman [ 38] demonstrated that the cell membrane complexlipids of hair ﬁbers are degraded more by visible light, but also by UV-A and byUV-B light, helping to explain the weakened cell membrane complex and themultiple step fractures observed in sunlight oxidized hair described in detail inChap. 5. Obvious weak links to photochemical attack on lipid structures are the136 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
allylic hydrogen atoms of unsaturated fatty acids and the tertiary hydrogen atoms of18-MEA and other species. Hoting and Zimmerman also demonstrated that the cellmembrane complex lipids of chemically bleached hair are more readily degradedby physical actions than the lipids of chemically unaltered hair. For example, longerterm irradiation does not provide for clean breaks between structural components ofhair as was observed for peroxide oxidized hair, see Chap. 5for details. For moredetails on the structure of the CMC and the hair surface see the sections entitledEpicuticle and the Hair Fiber Surface andThe Cell Membrane Complex Includingthe Intercellular Non-keratin Regions of Hair in Chap. 1.2.4.3.12 Four Different Classes of Human Hair LipidsThere are at least four different but meaningful classiﬁcations of hair lipids. Hairlipids are described as free or bound, as endogenous or exogenous lipids, as internalor surface and by chemical functional group or chemical type.
Bound lipids are those that cannot be removed by extracting the hair with lipidsolvents because they are covalently bonded to hair proteins. For example, 18-MEAis attached to proteins by thioester linkages, whereas free lipids are extractable fromhair using lipid solvents because they are held by weaker bonding forces such asvan der Waals attractive forces and sometimes hydrogen bonding or even salt links.Endogenous lipids are those hair lipids that result from biosynthesis in hair matrixcells in the hair follicle, whereas those lipids in the hair that are usually synthesizedin sebaceous glands are sometimes called exogenous of an extrinsic source. Internallipids are those that have either penetrated into the hair or have been incorporatedinside the hair ﬁber as opposed to surface lipids. Chemical groups commonly usedfor this type of classiﬁcation are similar to those described in the paragraphs below.
From the comprehensive study of hair lipids by Masukawa et al. [ 107] hair lipidswere described in the section entitled , Total Lipids in Hair Fibers . In this study, hairlipids were extracted and analyzed from both the proximal and distal parts of thehair of 44 Japanese females between the ages of 1 and 81 and the compositiondetermined quantitatively. These scientists separated the lipids into four groups bychemical type: Group A: Squalene (SQ), Wax esters (WE), Triglycerides (TG), andfatty acids (FA); Group B: cholesterol (CH) and ceramides (CER); Group C:hydrocarbons (HC) and Group D: 18-methyl eicosanoic acid (MEA). They alsoclassiﬁed these lipids by source, for example those from sebaceous glands and thosefrom hair matrix cells. These data are summarized in Table 2.13.2.4.3.13 Bound and Free LipidsThe bound lipids are those lipids of the cell membrane complex that are covalently
bonded to proteins including the 18-MEA attached to the epicuticle at the surface,described earlier in this Chapter and in Chap. 1. 18-MEA is part of a lipid mono-layer surrounding each cuticle cell. 18-MEA is bound to the top of each cuticle2.4 Chemical Composition of the Different Morphological Components 137
cell (and part of the scale edge) through thioester linkages [ 87]. 18-MEA forms theouter surface layer of the virgin hair surface as well as the top layer of each cuticlecell. The bottom of each cuticle cell and part of each scale edge is covered primarilywith straight chain fatty acids that are mainly palmitic, stearic and other fatty acidsincluding some oleic acid. These fatty acids are bound either through ester orthioester linkages to the underlying proteins. All other lipids that have beendescribed in the literature are believed to be free lipids, that is, lipids that are notcovalently bonded to hair proteins and they exist on and in the cuticle and thecortex. Additional details of covalently bound fatty acids are described in thesection on the Cell Membrane Complex in this Chapter and in Chap. 1.2.4.3.14 Surface Lipids of Human HairIf we deﬁne the hair surface as the top 3–5 nm of the hair ﬁber, we ﬁnd that 18-MEA
is the primary lipid of that surface, but there is also free lipid in this surface too andthere will likely be more free lipid in the surface the longer the time intervalbetween shampooing and when lipid analysis is made. Evidence to support freelipid in the surface of hair stems from deﬁning the hair surface as the top 3–5 nmand using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to measure the C/N ratios in thatsurface. Estimates appear in Table 2.15 for the percentages of free lipid, 18-MEA,protein and total lipids in the outermost 3–5 nm of the ﬁber.Some of the assumptions in these calculations are that the epicuticular proteinsconsist of 16.7% nitrogen and 45.3% carbon as calculated from the composition ofCE proteins by Zahn et al. [ 88]. For 18-MEA, the carbon content is represented byTable 2.15 Estimates of lipids and protein in the surface layers of hair ﬁbers as a function ofwashing and treatmentTreatment % Protein % MEA % FreelipidCalcC/NFoundC/NTotallipidWool Soxhlet

the acyl group without the sulfur because the sulfur is part of the protein structure.Therefore, the % carbon of 18-MEA is 81.6% and 75% carbon formerly used for thefree lipids as suggested by Carr, Leaver and Hughes [ 132] from the work by Rivettet al. [ 133].Carr, Willis St. John and George [ 132,134] examined wool ﬁber by XPS inwhich the ﬁbers had been Soxhlet extracted with chloroform/methanol. Thesescientists calculated that 18-MEA is approximately 1 /C60.5 nm thick. This estimateis smaller than the length of the 18-MEA molecule which approaches 3 nm.Therefore, Zahn et al. [ 77] concluded that the 18-MEA chains fold back onthemselves on the surface of keratin ﬁbers to achieve the measured thickness ofthe lipid layer.The data of Table 2.15 suggest that some free lipids are bound within the 18-MEA layer and as free lipids can be removed and then the 18-MEA chains fold backon themselves as suggested by Zahn et al. [ 77]. However, at higher free lipid levels
there is less nitrogen and therefore less protein in the top 3–5 nm. Thus as more freelipid is incorporated within the 18-MEA layer it allows the 18-MEA chains tostraighten out to accommodate the free lipid and to approach the expected length of18-MEA (2.7–2.8 nm calculated by this author) and to occupy a higher percentageof the top 3–5 nm of the surface.The data of Table 2.15 compares root ends vs. tip ends of hair more than 12 in.
long (~30 cm) and cut directly from the scalp. This hair was not shampooed prior toXPS analysis, but only rinsed with deionized water. These data show very high freelipid levels in spite of the high oxidation level revealed by the SVI data showing38.6% oxidized sulfur at the root ends and 68.8% oxidized sulfur at the tip ends. Inspite of the high oxidation levels of this hair the free lipid levels are also highbecause of the accumulation of free lipids in or on the surface and the lack ofshampooing of the sample prior to analysis. This conclusion is conﬁrmed by thedata of this same Table showing the effects of shampooing on the free lipid contentof another hair sample.The data of Table 2.15 also shows the effects of washing the hair with sodium
lauryl sulfate on the surface lipids. Note, this hair was sampled near the root endsfrom another person who had a lower level of oxidized sulfur compared to both rootand tip ends of hair described by the data in this same table. Washing the hair withsodium lauryl sulfate removed free lipids from the hair surface, but still left about12% free lipids in the top 3 nm of the hair.Capablanca and Watt [ 129] demonstrated that free lipids in the keratin ﬁber
surface serve to lower the isoelectric point of wool (hair) and thereby affect thecharge character of the surface. This free lipid could affect the binding of condi-tioner ingredients on and in the surface layers. Free lipids are also very difﬁcult orvirtually impossible to completely remove simply by shampooing or by means thatare available to consumers. Thus, free lipids should be viewed as vital componentsof the hair ﬁber surface that are important for protection of the hair and to theinteractions of conditioners and shampoos rather than as simply soil. For moredetails on the surface structure of human hair see the section in this Chapter entitledEpicuticle and the Hair Fiber Surface .2.4 Chemical Composition of the Different Morphological Components 139
2.4.3.15 Free Lipids in the Total Hair FiberThe data of Mazukawa et al. [ 107] (Table 2.13) demonstrated that fatty acids(~58%), wax esters (~20%) and hydrocarbons (~10%) comprise the major part ofthe free lipids in hair, almost 90% of the total lipid (free plus bound) in hair from apopulation of 44 Japanese females. These data are generally consistent with thetypes of free lipids found in the hair of Caucasian adults showing the largest amountas free fatty acids and the second largest amount as wax esters [ 135,136].A few years ago, Hussler et al. [ 137] isolated and identiﬁed low levels ofceramides in human hair lipid from Caucasians. Masukawa et al. identiﬁed thesesame ceramides as free lipids (~290 mg/g hair) at levels similar to those of 18-MEAby Masukawa et al. [~300 mg/g hair average at the proximal ends (470–220 mg/gvariation among individuals)], but slightly higher than the levels found by Husslerand co-workers (~100 mg/g).
and co-workers (~100 mg/g).According to data by Nicolaides and Rothman [ 138] lipid extracted from humanhair is similar but not identical to the composition of scalp lipid. However, cellmembrane complex lipid is also partially removed by extraction of hair with lipidsolvents or surfactants. In a sense, the scalp serves as a lipid supply system for thehair, with sebum being produced continuously by the sebaceous glands [ 139,140].Sebum production is controlled hormonally by androgens that increase cell prolif-eration in the sebaceous glands. In addition, seasonal and even daily variations inthe rate of sebum production do occur [ 139].The aging of the sebaceous glands in man is controlled primarily by endocrinesecretions [ 139]. For children, sebaceous secretion is low until puberty, when alarge increase in sebaceous activity occurs (see Fig. 2.2). Note, the data of Fig. 2.2
did not permit a plot of the entire age curve for females; however, the same generaleffect of low sebaceous activity for males and females before puberty does exist.Fig. 2.2 Variation of sebum production on foreheads with age. Data are from Pochi et al.[141,142]140 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
For all ages, sebaceous-gland activity is lower for women than for men [ 139], andshortly before menopause (generally decreasing substantially in the mid-forties agerange), there is a distinct decrease in sebum secretion, to even lower levels, seeFig.2.2and,The effects of Menopause on the lipids in hair and on the hair ﬁber. Formales, there is more of a gradual reduction in sebum secretion with age beyondabout 30 years. Strauss and Pochi [ 140–141] concluded that in both males andfemales, androgenic secretions are of primary importance for sebaceous-glanddevelopment and activity.Extraction of human hair with “fat solvents” removes approximately 1–9% lipidmatter. Ethanol, a solvent that swells hair, removes more material from hair thannon-swelling solvents like benzene, ether, or chloroform. Hair consists of surfaceand internal lipid. In addition, part of the internal lipid is covalently bound and part
is not covalently bound but both types of lipid can be cell membrane complex lipid.The cell membrane complex is laminar in structure and is composed of both proteinand lipid layers; however, this structural lipid is not phospholipid [ 143,144] like thelipids normally associated with bilayers of cell membranes (see the sections on TheStructures of the Three Different Cell Membrane Complexes in Chap. 1andadditional parts of this chapter).The data (1–9% extracted hair lipid) represent total matter extracted from hairclippings of individual men and women. Although the conditions for extraction can
inﬂuence the amount of matter extracted from hair (Crawford R. Private communi-cation), the values here represent “approximate” maxima and serve to indicate thevariation in the amount of solvent extractable material from hair among individuals.Presumably, the principal material in these extracts consists primarily of free fattyacids (FFA) and neutral fat (esters, waxes, hydrocarbons, and alcohols). Gloor[145] classiﬁed the different components of sebum into six convenient groups:free fatty acids (FFA), triglycerides (TG), free cholesterol (C), cholesterol and waxesters (C & WE), parafﬁns (P), and squalene (S). These classes are similar but notidentical to the classiﬁcation groups by Masukawa et al. [ 107].Spangler synthetic sebum (Table 2.16) provides a working formula to representan imitation of average sebum. It contains lipid compounds to represent each of thesix components of Gloor’s classiﬁcation for sebum. Nicolaides and Foster [ 146]
examined ether extracts of pooled hair clippings from adult males and found 56.1%as FFA and 41.6% as neutral fat. In contrast, daily soaking of the scalps of adultsTable 2.16 Spanglersynthetic sebumLipid ingredient PercentageOlive oil (TG) 20Coconut oil (TG) 15Palmitic acid (FFA) 10Stearic acid (FFA) 5Oleic acid (FFA) 15Parafﬁn wax (P) 10Squalene (S) 5Spermaceti (WE) 15Cholesterol (C) 52.4 Chemical Composition of the Different Morphological Components 141
(males) in ether provided 30.7% FFA and 67.6% neutral fat. Nicolaides andRothman [ 138] suggested that this apparent discrepancy is likely from lipolytichydrolysis of glycerides in the stored hair clippings.Analysis of the FFA extracted from pooled hair clippings of adult males wasconducted by Weitkamp et al. [ 117]. Their study did not contain data concerningthe effect of lipolysis on the structures of FFA in hair fat. Saturated and unsaturatedfatty acids ranging in chain length from 5 to 22 carbon atoms were found in humanhair fat [ 117,147]. Location of the double bond in the unsaturated acids issuggested to occur at the 6, 7 position, with some 8, 9 and other isomers. Datafrom the study by Weitkamp et al. [ 117] are summarized in Table 2.17. In additionto the acids reported by Weitkamp et al. [ 117], Gershbein and Metcalf [ 147]
examined the total fatty-acid content (following saponiﬁcation) of human hair fatand found traces of C5 and C6 carboxylic acid and small quantities of C19 and C21acids, as well as branched-chain isomers of several other fatty acids [ 147].Comparison of the FFA content [ 117] with the total (hydrolyzed) fatty acidcontent [ 148] is summarized in Table 2.18. This comparison assumes that data fromdifferent laboratories are comparable. With the exception of the C16 and C20 acids,the data in columns A and B of Table 2.18 are very similar for each corresponding
acid. Equivalence suggests that the relative amounts of each acid in ester formwould be the same as the relative ratios of the free acids, and that hydrolysis mayoccur on standing (or other conditions) to increase the ratio of FFA to esters. Thenoteworthy exceptions are the C16 saturated acid that must exist in ester form to agreater extent than suggested by the relative ratios of free acids and the C20unsaturated acid, that was found only in trace quantities by Gershbein and Metcalf[147]. A further conclusion from these studies is that the principal acyl groupspresent in human hair lipids are from the C16 fatty acids.Table 2.17 Composition ofFFA in human hair lipidChain length % Total FFA % Unsaturated FFAof this chain length7 0.07 –8 0.15 –9 0.20 –10 0.33 –11 0.15 –12 3.50 413 1.40 314 9.50 1515 6.00 2516 36.00 5017 6.00 6718 23.00 8020 8.50 8522 2.00 –Residue 4.00 –Total 100.80142 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
Analysis of some of the neutral material from human hair lipid, for example,triglycerides, cholesterol or wax esters, and parafﬁns provides a mixture as complexas that of the fatty acids [ 117,138,146,149]. Although not all of the compounds ofthese different components of hair lipid have been fully analyzed, it is obvious fromthe discussion on fatty acids and the literature on wax alcohols in human hair lipid[117,147,149,150] that the variation in chain length and isomer distribution of allof these esters must be extremely complex. The data of Table 2.18 compares thefree fatty acid content of human hair with the total fatty acids from hydrolysis.These data show that C16 fatty acids are at the highest levels consistent with otherdata, but do not contain 18-MEA because these data are more than 40 years old.It is well known that the amount of sebaceous secretion increases with age nearpuberty [ 139,140]. The composition of the sebaceous secretion also changes at that
time [ 151]. Nicolaides and Rothman [ 151] demonstrated that the parafﬁnic hydro-carbon content of sebum is highest in children (boys), lower in men, and lowest inwomen. These same two scientists also showed that the squalene content of the hairlipid of children is approximately 1.35% of the total lipid content and about one-fourth that of adults. Sebum from boys’ age 6 to 12 was examined in this study andcompared to that from both men and women. In addition, the cholesterol content ofthe hair lipid of adults is lower than that from children: 3.7% vs. 12.2% [ 151].Nicolaides and Rothman [ 138] determined with small sample sizes that hairfrom African-Americans contains more lipid than hair from Caucasians. Gershbeinand O’Neill [ 149] examined the distribution of fatty alcohols of human hair lipid to
determine the relative amounts of fatty alcohols and sterols with regard to sex, race,and scalp condition. Samples originated from Caucasians and African-Americans,Table 2.18 Comparison ofFFA content of human hairwith total fatty acid contentChain length % Total FFA [ 117] % Total fatty acids [ 147]12 3.36 2.1913 1.36 –14 8.10 8.4015 5.50 6.7016 18.00 24.9017 2.00 2.3018 5.00 4.6020 1.30 –Chain length Relative ratioto C14 FFARelative ratio to C14total fatty acids12 0.4 0.313 0.2 –14 1.0 1.015 0.7 0.816 2.2 3.017 0.3 0.318 0.6 0.620 0.2 –Only those acids above 1% are listed2.4 Chemical Composition of the Different Morphological Components 143
both full haired and balding, and from Caucasian women. The data indicatedessentially no differences among these parameters between the two racial groupsor between the sexes. Kreplak et al. [ 152] examined lipid proﬁles in transverse cutsacross hair using synchrotron infrared micro-spectrometry and determined thatCaucasian hair often contains lipids localized inside the medulla and the cuticle,but it occurs to a lesser degree inside the cuticle. Further, the African-American hairthat was analyzed does not show these same hair lipid effects across the section andis insensitive to solvent extraction.Several other factors relevant to differences in sebum composition on the scalphave been described in the literature. Anionic surfactants or ether extraction of thescalp does not stimulate the rate of re-fatting [ 153,154]. Selenium disulﬁde in ashampoo increases sebum production [ 154] and it alters the ratio of triglycerides to
free fatty acids found in sebum. Presumably, this latter effect involves reducing themicroﬂora responsible for lipolytic enzymes on the scalp that hydrolyzetriglycerides to free fatty acids. Zinc pyrithione appears to behave similarly andhas been shown to increase hair greasiness [ 155], presumably in an analogousmanner. However, ketoconazole (another antifungal agent) behaves in the oppositemanner. Pierard-Franchimont et al. [ 156] conﬁrmed the increase in sebum excretionrate for selenium sulﬁde and further demonstrated that ketoconazole decreasessebum excretion.Several studies demonstrated signiﬁcant differences in the lipid composition ofoily vs. dry hair. Perhaps the most comprehensive study in this regard was by Kochet al. [ 144], who examined hair surface lipid from 20 dry- and oily-haired subjects,3 days after shampooing, and found the following correlations with increasing hairoiliness:An increasing percentage of wax esters in the lipid,
An increasing ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids,An increasing amount of monoglycerides, andA decreasing percentage of cholesterol esters with increasing oiliness.The quantity of total lipid was not found by Koch to correlate with hair oiliness.However, this is not surprising (in a several-day study), because the quantity of lipidon hair tends to level after a few days from shampooing because of partial removalof excess lipid by rubbing against objects such as combs or brushes and evenpillows and hats.Koch et al. [ 144] explained oily vs. dry hair by the rheological characteristics ofthe resultant scalp lipid. For example, increasing the ratio of unsaturated tosaturated fatty acids should decrease the melting point of the sebum, making itmore ﬂuid and thereby more oily. Monoglycerides are surface-active and thereforeshould enhance the distribution of sebum over the hair [ 144]. Factors such as ﬁber
cross-sectional area or hair curliness were kept constant in Koch’s experiments andthus not considered; however, one would expect the degree of oiliness to affectstraight, ﬁne hair the most and to have the least cosmetic effect on curly coarsehair [ 157].144 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
Bore et al. [ 158] found that the structures of the C18 fatty acids of oily and dryhair differ. For subjects with dry hair, Bore et al. found the predominant isomer asoctadecenoic acid (oleic acid), whereas for subjects with oily hair 8-octadecenoicacid was the predominant isomer. Thus oily hair is different from dry hair in itschemical composition and in its rheological character. Hair lipid plays a critical rolein shampoo evaluation (Crawford R. Private communication) and in surface effectsof hair, such as frictional effects [ 159]. See Chap. 6for discussion of the removal ofhair lipid by shampoos.2.4.4 The Effects of Menopause on the Lipids in Hairand the Hair SurfaceWills et al. [ 160] showed that the cholesterol and ceramide (both matrix cell origin)
content of the hair of pre-menopausal women was signiﬁcantly higher while waxesters and squalene contents (both primarily from sebum) were signiﬁcantly lowerin post-menopausal women. These same authors noted that their analytical proce-dure could not distinguish between wax esters and cholesterol esters; however thewax ester levels are much higher in adult human hair than cholesterol esters asshown by the work of Pochi, Strauss and Downing [ 161].Wills et al. [ 160] also found that the hair of pre-menopausal women (N ¼80)was signiﬁcantly greasier than the hair of post-menopausal women (N ¼47).These scientists used expert visual assessment for this determination. In this samestudy, the hair of post-menopausal women on hormone replacement therapy(N¼39) was intermediate in greasiness and all three groups’ scores were signiﬁ-cantly different from each other. In addition, the amount of lipid found on theforehead of these same subjects was signiﬁcantly higher in the pre-menopausal
group than both of the other groups and the post-menopausal group not on hormonereplacement therapy had the lowest amount of lipid ( /C057% vs. the pre-menopausalgroup). This effect is consistent with that of Pochi and Strauss [ 141,161] whoshowed that hair on the foreheads of women decreased signiﬁcantly in the mid-forties and has been attributed to the menopause.Analysis of the amount of actual hair lipid by Wills et al. was on only 20 selectedsubjects of each group and proved to be not signiﬁcantly different between the pre-and post-menopausal groups. These authors speculated that perhaps other factorssuch as “permeability of hair to sebum changes with menopause” or that the mannerthat the groups were balanced interfered with this determination.The ages of these three groups were: pre-menopausal, mean age 30, range
24–34; post-menopausal, mean age 60, range 50–76; and post-menopausal withhormone replacement therapy, mean age 57, range 48–68. So, the prime variablesare menopause and hormone replacement therapy, however there is also an addi-tional factor of age especially between pre- and post-menopausal groups.2.4 Chemical Composition of the Different Morphological Components 145
Data for lipids on and in hair by age from an unpublished study by P&G/WellaHair Research Group (see Fig. 2.3) shows a corresponding relationship to that foundon foreheads by Pochi and Strauss [ 141] and by Wills et al. [ 160]. In this study, hairsamples were collected from 51 Caucasian females varying in age from 7 to 88.This hair was extracted and analyzed by GC/MS (at the German Wool ResearchInstitute (DWI)) for lipids. A Box plot of the Wella data revealed two outliers andthe data was not normally distributed by the Shapiro-Wilk test (Shapiro-WilkW¼0.942 and p ¼0.0147). But, when these two outliers were rejected the dataprovided a normal distribution with a Shapiro-Wilk W of 0.978 and a p ¼0.5 (verygood). These normally distributed data when regressed vs. age provided a quadraticmodel with p <0.0001, root mean square error of 5.623 and an r2of 0.387. Fromthe model equation, the maximum for hair lipids was at age 45 corresponding to
about where the steep drop occurs for sebum production on the foreheads of womenby Pochi and Strauss [ 141] of Fig. 2.2. The age 45 peak appears to be inﬂuencedby the peri-menopause and is consistent with the work and conclusions of Willset al. [ 160].It is very clear from all of this work on hair lipids and age that the lipid levels inhair change with age. Large changes occur both at puberty and around ages 45–55.These changes at middle to advanced age are greater for women than for men.The changes that occur at both of these stages of life involve not only lipid levels,but also composition changes in the hair lipids. Wills et al. [ 160] in their study onpre- and post-menopausal effects determined that these changes affect hair greasi-ness, hair shine, hair softness and smoothness. All four of these properties decreasesigniﬁcantly with menopause and age.In addition to these effects, Mirmirani and Dawson et al. [ 162] determined
that post-menopausal women have signiﬁcantly lower frontal scalp hair density,lower growth rates and lower hair ﬁber diameters than pre-menopausal women.A phototrichogram method was used to quantitate these hair parameters. Twostudies were conducted by these scientists; an initial study included 44 women,20 in the post-menopausal group and 24 in the pre-menopausal group. The secondstudy included 177 women (ages 40–60) with 54 in the pre-menopausal, 33 in aFig. 2.3 Total hair lipidlevels as a function of age.Data are from the P&G WellaHair Research Group146 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
peri-menopausal group (irregular periods or cessation of periods for less than12 months.) and 90 in the post-menopausal group. Hair growth rate was signiﬁ-cantly lower in frontal than occipital regions. Growth rates were also signiﬁcantlyhigher in pre-menopausal vs. post-menopausal women in both frontal and occipitalsites. Hair density in the occipital site was not affected by menopause; however,hair density in the frontal site was signiﬁcantly lower in post-menopausal vs. pre-menopausal women.In both frontal and occipital sites pre-menopausal women had higher anagenpercentages than in post-menopausal sites. Average hair ﬁber diameters weresigniﬁcantly higher in pre-menopausal vs. post-menopausal women in the frontalsite, but not in the occipital site (no signiﬁcant difference). In the expanded study onthe frontal site, average ﬁber diameters were signiﬁcantly higher in pre-menopausal
vs. post-menopausal and peri-menopausal sites. However, there was no signiﬁcantdifference in hair ﬁber diameters in peri-menopausal and post-menopausal sites.The data suggest that the ﬁber diameter effect is independent of age. Mirmirami andDawson et al. concluded that clinical observations support the effects of estrogenson hair biology; however, the current evidence is not adequate to attribute speciﬁchair changes to hormonal effects of menopause.This decrease in hair ﬁber diameter with menopause will decrease tensile andbending stiffness of hair ﬁbers. The effe cts on ﬁber diameter in combination withthe hair density decrease in the frontal region should produce changes in impor-tant consumer assessment s in that scalp region. For example, hair body will
decrease. This effect should appear immediately after shampooing; however thedecrease in hair greasiness that will appear after a day or two or longer will tend topartly offset the hair body effect exce pt for the everyday shampooer. I wouldanticipate related effects on combing ease, that is, as Robbins and Reich [ 163]have shown the decrease in stiffness will tend to make the hair more difﬁcult tocomb while the decrease in hair densit y/area will tend to make the hair combeasier. Which of these effects are stronger i s too difﬁcult to say. Nevertheless, thedecrease in hair greasiness will also tend to make the hair more difﬁcult to comb.But, the greasiness effect will take a day or longer after shampooing to take effect.So, the net effects on combing ease are more difﬁcult to predict than on hair bodywithout actual combing data.2.4.5 The Composition of the CortexSince the cortex comprises the major part of the hair ﬁber mass, results of whole-
ﬁber analysis of hair may be considered to be a good approximation of thecomposition of the cortex (see Table 2.7). The largest errors resulting from thisapproximation will be in those amino acids occurring in smaller quantities in thecortex.Average cortex is rich in cystine (although there is less cystine in cortex than incuticle). The cortex is also richer in diacidic amino acids and lysine and histidine2.4 Chemical Composition of the Different Morphological Components 147
than is cuticle. However, the two main components of cortex, the intermediateﬁlaments and the matrix, are very different in chemical composition. The interme-diate ﬁlament proteins are rich in leucine and in glutamic acid and those aminoacids that are generally found in alpha-helical proteins. Although small quantitiesof cystine (~6%), lysine, and tyrosine are also regularly arranged in the intermediateﬁlaments [ 143], for additional details see the section entitled , Type I and II KeratinProteins (IF Proteins )of Human Hair in this Chapter. On the other hand, the matrixis rich in cystine (about 21%, calculated from the sulfur content of gamma keratoseof human hair) and proline and those amino acids that resist helix formation suchas the KAP Proteins in The KAP Proteins of Human Hair in this Chapter. Foradditional information on the composition of the intermediate ﬁlaments and also thematrix, see the section on fractionation and peptide analysis of hair in this Chapter.
Also see the section in Chap. 1entitled The Origin of Hair Fiber Curvature whichexplains the distribution and composition of proteins of different types of corticalcells in human hair.2.4.6 The Composition of the MedullaStudies of the medulla of human hair are complicated, because it has poor solubilityand is difﬁcult to isolate, see the photomicrographs of the medulla in Chap. 1.I nfact, most of the experimental work on medulla has been on African porcupinequill, horse hair, goat hair, or human beard hair medulla rather than medulla ofhuman scalp hair ﬁber. Rogers [ 164] described the amino acid composition ofmedullary protein isolated from porcupine quill, and his results are summarizedin Table 2.7showing very low levels of cysteine and high levels of basic aminoacids such as lysine and acidic amino acids such as glutamic acid.Blackburn [ 165] determined some of the amino acids from medulla of wool
ﬁbers. Most wool ﬁbers do not contain a medulla; however, some coarse wool likekemp or mohair does contain this porous component. Although Blackburn’s resultsare more qualitative, they agree in general with the data of Rogers, suggesting lowcystine content compared to whole ﬁber, and relatively large amounts of acidic andbasic amino acids.Langbein et al. [ 166] demonstrated 12 hair keratin proteins and 12 epithelialkeratins that are potentially expressed in medullary cells of human beard hair medulla.The genes that form these keratins are located on the type I KRT18 gene along withgenes located on chromosomes 17 and 12. These scientists also found a few corticalcells in this same beard hair medulla. This cortical cell effect may be exclusive tohuman beard hairs because this same pattern has not been reported in other highlymedullated animal hairs. Langbein et al. concluded that medulla cells are distinct
from all other hair follicle cells in keratin expression proﬁle and keratin number.If one assumes that medullary protein of porcupine quill is representative ofmedullary protein of human hair, some interesting comparisons can be made of the148 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
three morphological regions of human hair. Among the gross differences is the factthat cuticle has even higher cystine content than whole ﬁber while medulla has onlytrace quantities of cystine. Medulla also appears to have relatively small amounts ofhydroxy amino acids and relatively large amounts of basic and acidic amino acidscompared to the other two morphological components of animal hairs. These factssuggest that medulla will be more susceptible to reactions with acids and alkalis andto ion exchange reactions such as reactions with anionic and cationic surfactants,ionic dyes and metals. But medulla will be less sensitive to reaction with reducingagents. One must also consider that since medulla is located at the core of the ﬁber,it is protected by both the cuticle and the cortex and by the slow rate of diffusionthrough these two morphological regions.2.5 N-Terminal and C-Terminal Amino Acids and SCMKFractionation2.5.1 N-Terminal Amino Acids
Fractionation2.5.1 N-Terminal Amino AcidsKerr and Godin [ 167], used the dinitrophenylation method of Sanger [ 168]a n didentiﬁed valine, threonine, glycine, ala nine, serine, glutamic acid, and asparticacid as N-terminal amino acids in human hair. Quantitative data by Leon [ 61],Speakman [ 169] and Hahnel [ 170] for N-terminal amino acids of human hair aresummarized in Table 2.19. All of these references identify the same seven aminoacids as N-terminal residues in human ha ir. In addition, there is agreement for therelative quantities of glycine, alanine, s erine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid asN-terminal groups. However, the quantita tive data for valine and threonine arein discord. The apparent disagreement of these data may be due to differences inthe relative ratios of the different proteins in the different samples caused byTable 2.19 N-terminal amino acids in human hair (relative ratios)Amino acids Micromol/Gm hair Relative ratios of amino acids

Hahnel [ 170]r e p o r t e dt h e s es a m eseven amino acids as N-terminal residues in calluses, psoriasis scales, nails andhair ﬁber.2.5.2 C-Terminal Amino AcidsThe C-terminal amino acids in human hair have been identiﬁed by Kerr and Godin[167] using the hydrazinolysis method of Niu and Fraenkel-Conrat [ 171]. Theseamino acids are threonine, glycine, alanine, serine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid.Interestingly, all six of these amino acids also serve as N-terminal residues. Thesesame six C-terminal amino acids have been identiﬁed by Bradbury as C-terminalresidues in wool ﬁber [ 172].2.5.3 Fractionation ProceduresMore extensive peptide investigations of keratin ﬁbers generally consist of
solubilizing the keratin; separation of the resultant mixture by means of solubility,chromatography, or electrophoresis; and analysis of the resultant fractions.A commonly used method for preparing keratins for sequencing or peptide analysisconsists of solubilizing the keratins with strong reducing solutions, usually salts ofdithiothreitol or thioglycolic acid [ 173] or by using enzymes or mixtures orsequential treatments of reducing agents and enzymes [ 76]. With the S-carboxymethyl keratin procedure, the reduced keratin is reacted with iodoacetic acid,forming the S-carboxy methyl keratin (SCMK) derivatives [ 174] to enhance thesolubility of the proteinaceous matter and to prevent reoxidation of the thiol groups.Radiolabelled iodoacetic acid is often used to tag the fractions and gel electropho-resis to separate the different protein fractions.K-SH  +  I-CH2-COOH K-S-CH2-COOH(SCMK)A relatively large amount of effort has gone into the fractionation of wool ﬁber
into its major protein components and the characterization of the resultant fractions.Thus, the mysteries underlying the detailed structures of the major proteins andpolypeptides of wool and human hair ﬁbers are gradually being unraveled. Thefollowing papers by Bringans et al. [ 76], Crewther et al. [ 175,176], Gillespie [ 177],Corﬁeld et al. [ 178], Cole et al.

2.6 Major Protein Fractions of Hair and Gene ExpressionDuring the past decade, a considerable amount of work has been done on the fraction-ation and amino acid sequencing of some of the major proteins of human hair. Inaddition, expression of genes, using in situ hybridization or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) expression by hair follicles or the use of speciﬁcprotein antibodies or other techniques have been useful in helping to elucidate whereand when the follicle genes are expressed.The phrase major protein is used in the sense of the highest concentrationproteins in the ﬁbers or a speciﬁc region of the ﬁbers. In this ﬁeld, the followingabbreviations are commonly used to describe the more important protein typesunder investigation:KAP, keratin associated proteins [formerly IFAP (intermediate ﬁlamentassociated proteins)]IF, intermediate ﬁlament proteins, now referred to as keratins [ 1]
HS, high sulfur proteinsUHS, ultra high sulfur proteinsHT, high tyrosine proteinsHGT, high glycine tyrosine proteinsRogers [ 1] described the terms keratin and keratin-associated proteinsexplaining that the term keratin today generally refers to the intermediate ﬁlamentproteins of the ﬁber, a clear distinction from the past. On the other hand, many ofthe KAPs are the high sulfur and ultra high sulfur proteins that commonly occur inthe cuticle as well as in the matrix of the cortex.For one procedure of analysis, Rogers et al. [ 182] suggested extracting the hairwith dithiothreitol in alkali and 8 M urea, labeling with C14 iodoacetic acid at pH
8 and separation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in sodium decylsulfate solution. This procedure provides a separation into two major fractions forhuman hair consisting of high sulfur proteins that are from the matrix and classiﬁedas KAP proteins and a second fraction of low sulfur proteins that are IF material.A third fraction from wool ﬁbers, but not present in human hair, consists of HGTproteins that are also matrix or KAP proteins. The status of the research concernedwith differentiation into cuticle and cortical KAP proteins and the genes thatcorrespond to these various proteins is summarized in the papers by Powell andG.E. Rogers [ 184] and in the review by G.E. Rogers [ 1] and in these two excellentreviews by Langbein and M.A. Rogers [ 185,186].2.6.1 The KAP Proteins of Human HairThe keratin associated proteins include those that form the matrix of the cortex and
the high cystine containing proteins of the cuticle. These proteins were discovered2.6 Major Protein Fractions of Hair and Gene Expression 151
more than three decades ago and some of their sequences are described in thisreference by Powell and G.E. Rogers [ 184]; however the more recent review byM.A. Rogers and Langbein [ 187] covers the literature over the three decadesleading up to 2006 and is extremely helpful to anyone interested in this area ofresearch. Clusters of genes on at least ﬁve chromosomes 17q12-21, 21q22.1, 21q23,11p15.5 and 11q13.4 are involved in the production of more than 80 different KAPs[80,159].The paper by Rogers and Langbein et al. [ 187] contains a helpful diagram that Ihave modiﬁed and used for the schematic of Fig. 2.4. This diagram illustratesseveral of the important KAP proteins in human hair cuticle and cortex. Rogersand Langbein suggested that the KAP 5, KAP 10, KAP 17.1 and KAP 12 occur inthe largest amounts in human hair cuticle whereas the KAP 1, KAP 2, KAP 3, KAP
4, KAP 9, KAP 7, KAP 19.1 and KAP 19.2 occur in the largest amounts in thecortex. Anyone interested in the KAP’s of the human hair cuticle and the cortex,their sequences, the domains that these proteins are found in and their genomicexpression should read this review paper by Rogers and Langbein [ 187].G.E. Rogers further explained that the KAP proteins of the matrix are a largegroup of perhaps as many as 100 different proteins. Rogers described the order ofexpression of genes and thus the synthesis of many of the proteins of the differentparts of the hair ﬁber. The Ultra high sulfur proteins including those of the cuticleare among the last KAP’s that are expressed. There are at least two unique familiesof proteins the KAP5 and KAP10s of the hair cuticle which are major componentsFig. 2.4 Schematic indicating some KAP proteins of human hair cuticle and cortex, patternedafter a schematic by Rogers and Langbein [ 159]152 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
of the exocuticle [ 1], the A-layer [ 76] and the epicuticle membrane of the hairsurface and of cuticle cells [ 95].The HS proteins generally contain about 20% of their residues as half-cystineand the UHS proteins usually contain between 30% and 35% residues of half-cystine. These latter proteins in wool have been shown to be affected by the cystine/cysteine level in the wool follicle [ 1] which is determined by the cystine/cysteinelevel in the plasma. Proline generally occurs in the high sulfur proteins at arelatively high level (about 7–9%) and has been suggested as an indicator for theHS proteins. Marshall and Gillespie [ 29] suggested that the half cystine content ofnormal human scalp hair should be in the range of 17–18% and should not vary withage, but should vary only from sunlight, cosmetic treatment and biochemicalabnormalities.Although, the HS and UHS proteins are rich in half-cystine they contain very
little to no methionine. Methionine, in the diet, is important to these proteinsbecause it can be converted into cysteine [ 184]. The important role of cystine/cysteine in protein synthesis and to hair growth in the follicle is summarized well byPowell and Rogers [ 184] who described this subject in great detail. In the late 1990sthere were at least eight families of KAP’s ranging from 12 to 41 mol% cystine. Asindicated before, there are also glycine-tyrosine rich KAP’s, high sulfur cuticleKAP’s and high sulfur cortex KAP’s among others.Jenkins and Powell [ 188] examined ﬁve proteins expressed by the KAP5 family
of genes in sheep that encodes cysteine rich/glycine rich keratins in the cuticle. Allof these proteins are high cysteine (~30%), high glycine (~27%) proteins of thecuticle and in humans this gene family (KAP5) is from chromosome 11. Rogers inhis lucid review paper described this complex area even detailing some of thesignals that regulate cell speciﬁcity and gene expression. For further details of thisarea of research see the excellent reviews by Professor George Rogers [ 1] and theoutstanding reviews by M.A. Rogers and Langbein [ 185–187].2.6.2 Type I and II Keratin Proteins (IF Proteins) of Human HairTwo of the six different Types of IF Proteins are found in human hair. Type I andType II keratins are distinguished by their isoelectric point, the Type I proteinsbeing acidic and the Type II being basic or neutral. The nomenclature for the hairkeratins is explained in Chap. 1in Table 1.16. Important references on these
important proteins are [ 185–189]. Langbein and M.A. Rogers et al. [ 185,186]and Langbein and Schweitzer [ 189] described that the human hair keratin genefamilies have nine members in the Type I family and six members in the Type IIfamily. The genes are on human chromosomes 17q12-21 and 12q13 and there are15 functional genes, 9 for the Type I and 6 for the Type II families. The highestexpressed keratins of the cuticle are: Type I hHa5 (K35) and hHa2 (K32) and for2.6 Major Protein Fractions of Hair and Gene Expression 153
Type II are hHb5 (K85) and hHb2 (K82). Three of these same keratins are also inthe matrix of the cortex: hHa5 (K35), hHa2 (K32) and hHb5 (K85). The Type Ikeratins of the middle to upper cortex are hHa1 (K31), hHa3-I (K33a)/II (K33b),hHa4 (K34), hHa5 (K35), hHa6 (K36), hHa7 (K37) and hHa8 (K38). Type IIkeratins of cortex are hHb1 (K81), hHb3 (K83), hHb5 (K85) and hHb6 (K86)[185,186] see Fig. 2.5. The names in parenthesis are a newer nomenclature.The intermediate ﬁlaments in different tissues show some similarity in form; seeFig.1.36 in Chap. 1in the section entitled Intermediate Filaments for a discussionof these structures; however these structures differ considerably in their exactcomposition and conﬁguration [ 186–189]. The common structural feature amongthis class of proteins is the central helical rod [ 188]. On the other hand, a primary
difference is in the amino and carboxyl domains. These domains vary in both aminoacid sequences and size [ 189]. The end domains contain many cysteine residues andthese can even form cystine cross-links with cysteine residues of KAP proteins ofthe matrix.As described above, the intermediate ﬁlament protein molecules in keratins arecomposed of two different types of polypeptides, Type I (acidic side chains) andType II (neutral to basic side chains). Equimolar quantities of a Type I and Type IIare necessary to form an Intermediate ﬁlament (Fig. 1.36). These two chainsinitially coil about each other forming a two strand coiled-coil rope, thus the initialformation of each ﬁlament requires one acidic polypeptide that coils about a basicFig. 2.5 Schematic summarizing the IF keratins of human hair; Data from Rogers and Langbein[157,158]154 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
polypeptide partner or mate. Additional coiled coils join together end to end andlaterally. For additional details and references see Chap. 1in the section entitledIntermediate Filaments .The cystine content of the low sulfur intermediate ﬁlament regions is about 6%and is not uniformly dispersed between domains of an intermediate ﬁlament chain.The rod domain contains about only 3% half-cystine or as little as one half-cystineresidue, while the N terminal domain contains about 11% half-cystine and the Cterminal unit about 17% half-cystine [ 190,191]. It would appear that these half-cystine residues are involved in disulﬁde linkages but that many more disulﬁderesidues exist in the matrix.The acidic Type I intermediate ﬁlament proteins of human hair represent a classof proteins that are about 44 and 46 K in molecular weight, while the basic-neutralType II proteins are about 50, 59, and 60 K [ 192]. Langbein and Schweitzer [ 189]
described the IFs of the Medulla, the inner root sheath, the outer root sheath and thecompanion layer and discussed even newer nomenclatures for this important classof hair proteins. Amino acid sequences for the intermediate ﬁlament polypeptidesfrom several proteins including wool ﬁber were initially described by Crewtheret al. [ 176]. For a more comprehensive discussion of the IFs, see the manuscript byPowell and Rogers [ 184] and the references therein; also see the more recentreviews by Rogers [ 1] and the important papers by Langbein and M.A. Rogersand especially the review by Langbein and Schweitzer [ 189] and the discussion andreferences in Chap. 1in the section entitled Intermediate Filaments . Intermediateﬁlaments are involved in a large number of diseases. For a lead into that subject seeChap. 3and the discussion on Hair Abnormalities .2.6.3 Tricohyalin ProteinTricohyalin is a granular, proteinaceous material found in the cytoplasm of cells of
the inner root sheath that envelopes the growing hair ﬁber; see Fig. 1.6of Chap. 1.I tis a major protein synthesized during hair growth and can also be found in thematrix of the cortex and in the medulla of fully formed hair ﬁbers. However, its rolein the growth of human hair ﬁbers is not fully understood at this time. The aminoacid composition of tricohyalin protein found in sheep, guinea pig and humanhair follicles has been reported by Rogers et al. [ 193]. Tricohyalin contains citrul-line resulting from arginine conversion through the enzyme peptidyl argininedeiminase [ 192]. It also contains many repeat units and is larger in human hairthan in wool ﬁber (1,897 vs. 1,549 amino acid residues). Its sequencing studiesshow that tricohyalin is not a precursor of IF proteins. For more details on thisunique protein, see the review by Powell and Rogers [ 184].2.6 Major Protein Fractions of Hair and Gene Expression 155
2.7 Other Protein Fractionation MethodsAn older method of fractionation of keratin ﬁbers, the method of Alexander andEarland [ 97,194,195], consists of oxidation of the disulﬁde bonds of the hair tosulfonic acid groups, using aqueous peracetic acid solution, and separation of theoxidized proteins, generally by differences in solubilities of the differentcomponents of the mixture. The primary three fractions in this separation are calledkeratoses. The amino acid composition of these three fractions isolated from merinowool has been reported by Corﬁeld et al. [ 195].Fractionation of human hair into keratoses by the method of Alexander andEarland [ 97] as modiﬁed by Corﬁeld et al. [ 195] has been reported for human hairby Menkart et al. [ 25] (see Table 2.20). This procedure consists of oxidation of the
ﬁbers with aqueous peracetic acid and solubilization in dilute alkali. The insolublefraction is called beta keratose and is believed to consist of proteins derivedprimarily from cell membranes and similar matter. See the previous section inthis Chapter entitled, Proteins in the Cortical Cell Membranes , describing an aminoacid analysis of an extract of this fraction. Acidiﬁcation of the solution to pH 4.0produces a precipitate called alpha keratose that is believed to originate primarily inthe crystalline or ﬁbrillar regions of the cortex. The material remaining in solutionhas been labeled gamma keratose. It is the fraction containing the largest percentageof sulfur (see Table 2.20) and is believed to consist of proteins derived primarilyfrom the amorphous regions of the ﬁbers (primarily from the matrix of the cortex).Of special interest is the signiﬁcantly larger gamma keratose fraction from humanhair compared to merino wool (see Table 2.20). This is consistent with the higher
cystine content in human hair.Using a similar procedure, Crounse [ 196] examined a portion of the alphakeratose fraction by quantitative amino acid analysis. He found similar quantitiesin the amino acids of this fraction obtained from human hair and from fractions ofnails and epidermis, except for cystine, cysteine, and glycine.A modiﬁed version of this procedure has been described by Wolfram andMilligan [ 197]. Their procedure involves esteriﬁcation of the carboxyl groupsthat are believed to reside primarily on the alpha-helical proteins and proteins ofthe hair surface. Esteriﬁcation decreases the solubility of these proteins, allowingthe non-esteriﬁed proteins (of the matrix) to be extracted more easily. The solublefraction of this procedure is called gamma*keratose; it resembles gamma keratosebut provides a higher yield. The insoluble residue exhibits birefringence and iscalled the alpha-beta*keratose fraction.Table 2.20 Percent keratoses in human hair [ 25]

Other fractionations of human hair have been reported by Vickery et al. [ 26] andAndrews and deBeer [ 135] and by Lustig et al. [ 136]. The former paper describes ahydrolytic separation and the latter a fractionation by sulfonation followed byreduction [ 19]. These procedures have not been pursued to a great extent becauseof the inherent amino acid degradation in the initial solubilization reaction.2.8 Diet and Hair CompositionUltra high sulfur protein production appears to be very sensitive to the amount ofcysteine that is present in the diet of sheep [ 198] or available in the follicle. Thesame phenomenon most likely exists for human hair. Other than malnutrition, hairproteins have not been shown to be inﬂuenced by diet. Campbell et al. [ 198]demonstrated via nutritional studies on sheep that crimp frequency can be explainedby considering ﬁber growth rates as inﬂuenced by diet; see the data of Table 2.21.
These data show that crimp counts increase at low nutritional levels where thegrowth rates are slower for both high crimp and low crimp producing sheep. Thepercentages of sulfur and of high sulfur proteins also decrease at the low nutritionallevels where growth rates are slower. So protein composition as inﬂuenced by diet(malnutrition vs. normal nutrition) affects the ratio of high to low sulfur proteins insheep and it plays a role in determining hair ﬁber curvature. It is likely that thissame effect exists in humans, because of the results described (below) on malnutri-tion effects on hair composition and growth.Studies of the effects of diet in persons suffering malnutrition such as protein
deﬁciencies show that diet supplementation can inﬂuence the protein composition ofhuman hair. However, such effects have only been demonstrated among personssuffering from severe malnutrition and never among healthy persons on a normaldiet. For example, the cystine, arginine, and methionine contents of human hair havebeen reported to be inﬂuenced by diet that is insufﬁcient in protein content. Koyanagiand Takanohashi [ 142] conducted a study among eight- to nine-year-old Japanesechildren who had been fed millet and very little animal protein. Analysis of the hairfrom these children revealed cystine contents as low as 8.1% (675 mmol half cystineper gram of hair) rather than 17–18% as suggested by Marshall [ 29] as the normal halfcystine level in humans. Diet supplementation with shark liver oil produced a signiﬁ-cant increase in the cystine content of the hair among these children. Diet supplemen-tation with skim milk for 6 months produced an even larger increase in cysteine, most
likely from an increased synthesis of the Ultra high sulfur proteins.Table 2.21 Effect ofnutrition on high S Proteins &Crimp from Campbell et al.[198]Nutritional level High crimp wool Low crimp woolNorm Low Norm Norm Low NormCrimps/cm 7.0 9.0 6.7 1.7 3.8 2.0% S 4.08 3.17 4.08 3.26 2.75 3.22% High S Prot. 32 22 29 24 17 202.8 Diet and Hair Composition 157
Although, the HS and UHS proteins are rich in half-cystine they contain virtuallyno methionine. Methionine in the diet is important to these proteins because it canbe converted into cysteine and cystine [ 184]. The important role of cystine/cysteinein protein synthesis and to hair growth in the follicle is summarized well by Powelland Rogers [ 184].Cystine, methionine, and sulfur conten ts of the hair of children suffering fromkwashiorkor have also been reported to be lower than that of normal children[199]. The arginine content of hair has been reported to decrease as a result ofkwashiorkor [ 200]. In fact, Noer and Garrigues [ 200] reported arginine contentsof human hair in severe cases of kwashiorkor , as low as one-half the normal level.By analogy with the effects of diet and s ulfur enrichment on the high-sulfurproteins in wool ﬁber [ 201,202], these effects of a lower arginine content in
hair are probably a result of a decreased sy nthesis of the sulfur-rich proteins thatlikely contain arginine too.Cosmetic advertisements abound with the suggested or implied nutrient orhealth-beneﬁt claims provided by proteins or vitamins or even provitamins in cos-metic products. Marshall and Gillespie [ 202] offer the following conclusion withregard to nutrition and hair. “In healthy humans, it is unlikely that any signiﬁcantvariation in the proteins of hair will result from normal changes in nutrition.”Therefore, it is much less likely that such changes could ever be induced fromthese same ingredients or their precursors when applied topically in a shampoo or ahair conditioner.In fact, there have been no systematic studies of the effects of nutrients like
vitamins on the rate of wool or hair growth or structure. However, there are someindications that in dietary insufﬁciencies, supplements of folic acid (a B complexvitamin) or pyridoxine (a B complex vitamin, B6) could be helpful to hair growth.The logic behind these indications is that these vitamins play a role in cysteinemetabolism. However, cysteine metabolism does not take place in the non-livingpart of the hair ﬁber. On the other hand, panthenol, the precursor to pantothenic acid(another B complex vitamin) has never been demonstrated in any published scien-tiﬁc study to affect the nutrition or growth of hair. In a review on nutrition and hair,Flesch [ 148] reported, “There is no objective evidence available to support theassumption that pantothenic acid has a biochemical role in the production of hair.”Thus, there is no current objective evidence to support a nutritional beneﬁt to hairby this vitamin precursor.
Among sheep with dietary insufﬁciencies, the minerals copper and zinc whensupplemented to the diet have been shown to be important to wool ﬁber growth.Their effectiveness is attributed to the important roles these minerals play in sulfuramino acid metabolism; copper serves to catalyze the oxidation of cysteine tocystine cross-links during ﬁber synthesis [ 203]. A related effect has been shownto occur in African children with a deﬁciency in riboﬂavin and pantothenic acidwherein the hair grows with no or minimal pigment and is straight. This effect hasbeen associated with a copper deﬁciency and is explained in Chap. 3. Zinc isrequired for cell division to occur and it also appears to play a role in liver diseaseand protein metabolism [ 204].158 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
2.9 The Analysis and Origin of Protein Fragmentsfrom Damaged Hair: Useful Methodology for the FuturePartial removal and analysis of proteinaceous matter from damaged keratin ﬁberscan be traced back to the alkali solubility test. The alkali solubility test involvesexposing a weighed amount of hair to a ﬁxed volume of 0.1 N sodium hydroxidesolution at 20/C14C for a ﬁxed time [ 205,206] and isolating, drying and weighing thehair. The loss in weight provides the am ount of protein loss from the keratinwhich is almost always greater in damaged hair than undamaged hair. Forexample, Dubief [ 40] examined undamaged hair, the same hair exposed to visiblelight and hair exposed to UV plus visible light and found 1%, 1.6% and 3.5%alkaline soluble matter respectively. Inglis and Leaver [ 45]w e r eo n eo ft h eﬁ r s tto show that proteinaceous derived fra gments were removed or dissolved intothe bleach bath by treatment of wool ﬁber with aqueous alkaline hydrogenperoxide treatment.
Various schemes to solubilize and isolate the proteinaceous fragments or matterfrom damaged hair have subsequently been tried. Oku et al. [ 207] analyzed totalproteinaceous fragments from the hair dissolved in permanent wave solutions andrecommended this as an assay for hair damage. Sandhu and Robbins [ 208] shookchemically damaged and control hair ﬁbers in water or detergent solutions andanalyzed the total dissolved and insoluble proteinaceous matter separately andtogether by the Lowry test. Inoue, Ito and Kizawa [ 209] extracted the hair withdifferent reducing solutions and analyzed the extracted proteinaceous matter whichthey called Labile proteins by the BioRad Protein assay. The amount of extractedproteinaceous matter from the hair of three different permed treatments by thesescientists appeared to relate to the reduction in the tensile breaking force. Ruetsch,Yang and Kamath [ 210] extracted bleached hair, UV treated hair, permed hair and
bleached/UV treated hair and bleached/permed hair with 0.05 M dithiothreitol, 8 Murea and Tris buffer for 24 h and then sonicated the extract for 30 min. They thenderivatized the reduced hair with 20% iodoacetamide to prevent reoxidation. Theseextracts were then separated and analyzed by electrophoresis. Some of theconclusions from this study were:– Chemical bleaching with alkaline peroxide, fragments the matrix and the inter-mediate ﬁlament proteins,– Permanent waving hair produces soluble fragments from the matrix proteins,– Multiple perms and permanent waving followed by UV treatment decreases theIntermediate ﬁlament extractable protein fragments, but the matrix proteinfragments can still be extracted. Multiple perming and UV treatment can renderIF proteins less extractable possibly by producing higher molecular weightproteins via cross-linking or fusion reactions see Chap. 5in the section entitled
Long Term Irradiation Produces Fusion Reactions Across Structural Boundaries.Shorter term UV treatments were not examined.2.9 The Analysis and Origin of Protein Fragments from Damaged Hair 159
More recently Sinclair, Davis and Flagler et al. [ 211] analyzed water solutionsand suspensions from shaking hairs in water similar to the method of Sandhu andRobbins, but Davis and Flagler took this method to a higher level by determiningsome of the hair proteins from which the fragments/matter were actually derived.Davis and Flagler [ 211, Davis MG, Flagler M. Private communication] analyzedthe proteinaceous matter in solutions and suspensions from bleached and undam-aged hair via Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-Time of ﬂight massspectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and also by 2 Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis(2DGE) and demonstrated signiﬁcant decreases in chemically bleached hair inthese cortex proteins: acidic keratins 31, 33a, 33b and basic keratins 81, 83, 85and 86. K32 of the cuticle was also decreased by bleaching. This assay currently isnot as amenable to KAP proteins as it is to keratins which may be due to the small
fragment size requirements for mass spec analysis. More creative extension to thistype of procedure should expand its utility and reveal very useful information in thefuture for hair research.2.10 Water: A Fundamental Component of Human HairTable 2.22 summarizes the effects of relative humidity on the water content ofhuman hair (Anzuino G. Private communication). Additional data are described inChap. 9in the section entitled Water (RH), pH and Solvents and the Dimensions ofHair. Obviously, the determined moisture content of keratin ﬁbers depends on theconditions selected as the state of dryness [ 142] as well as on the RH. The amountof moisture in hair also plays a critical role in its physical and cosmetic properties,as described in Chap. 9. The data of Table 2.22 were obtained by dehydration ofthe ﬁbers in a dry box over calcium chloride and determining the regain atincreasing humidity. Chamberlain and Speakman [ 212] reported the moisture con-
tent of human hair by moisture regain from the dry state and by way of dehydrationfrom 100% RH. Their data show a hysteresis wherein the moisture contents atintermediate humidity are slightly lower by the hydration method than by dehydra-tion. This hysteresis phenomenon is described in more detail in Chap. 9.Similarly, hair dried with heat can exhibit lower moisture content than hair driedat room temperature [ 213]. After heat-drying, hair absorbs moisture but does notTable 2.22 Water contentof hair at different relativehumiditiesRHaApproximate moisture contentb(%)29.2 6.040.3 7.650.0 9.865.0 12.870.3 13.6aTemperature ¼74/C14FbEach value is an average of ﬁve determinations on dark brownItalian hair from DeMeo Bros. reported to be undamaged chemi-cally.

return to the room temperature dried moisture level until it is either rewet withwater or conditioned at a higher relative humidity. Thus, a hysteresis exists betweenheat-dried hair and room temperature dried-hair similar to that from absorption vs.desorption of moisture.Hysteresis phenomena in the water sorption by high polymers [ 214] and byother proteins such as wool ﬁber [ 215] and casein [ 216] have also been described.Smith [ 214] suggested that hysteresis is a result of differences in the ratio of“bound” to “free” water in the substrate, with a larger amount of bound waterpresent on desorption than on absorption because more water binding sites areaccessible from the wet state than the dry state.Undoubtedly, the several hydrophilic side chains (guanidino, amino, carboxyl,hydroxyl, phenolic, etc.) and peptide bonds of keratin ﬁbers contribute to water
sorption, although there is controversy over the primary water-binding groups.Leeder and Watt [ 216], in a very interesting study involving water sorption ofunaltered and deaminated wool ﬁbers, concluded that the binding of water by aminoand guanidino groups is responsible for a large percentage of the water sorptioncapacity of keratin ﬁbers, especially at low humidities. On the other hand, Breuerconcluded that the peptide bonds are preferential sites for hydration [ 60].The conclusions of Leeder and Watt are supported by Pauling [ 217], whodescribed the negligible attraction of water by the polypeptide nylon, and theapparent agreement between the number of molecules of water initially sorbed byseveral proteins and the number of polar side-chain groups in those proteins.Spectroscopic studies of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of both humanhair [ 218] and wool ﬁber [ 219] indicated that the protons of water in keratin ﬁbers
are hydrogen-bonded and are less mobile than in the bulk liquid. At relativehumidity, below 25%, water molecules are principally bonded to hydrophilic sitesof the ﬁber by hydrogen bonds and can be described by Langmuir’s fundamentaltheory for the absorption of gases on solids [ 220]. As the humidity increases,additional water is sorbed, producing a decrease in the energy of binding of wateralready associated with the protein. At very high RH, above 80%, multi-molecularsorption (water on water) becomes increasingly important.Feughelman and Haly [ 220] and Cassie [ 221] suggested two different models forestimating the amounts of bound “un-mobile” and mobile “free or liquid” waterpresent in keratin ﬁbers. Feughelman and Haly deﬁned bound water as waterassociated with the keratin structure and mobile water as water not associateddirectly with the keratin structure. This model considers the decrease in energy of
binding of water molecules already associated with the keratin structure withincreasing water content. King [ 222] discusses two- and three-phase adsorptiontheories to explain the adsorption of moisture by textile materials. His conclusionsand cautions are pertinent to this same phenomenon in human hair. King suggestedthat it is relatively easy to derive a sorption isotherm that ﬁts an empirical relationusing two or three adjustable coefﬁcients, and he cautioned others in keratin scienceto make sure the theory they consider does not contradict accepted physicalprinciples. The effects of water on swelling, friction, tensile, and other propertiesof human hair are described in Chap. 9.2.10 Water: A Fundamental Component of Human Hair 161
2.11 Trace Metals in Human HairThere are a number of studies describing the quantitative determination of variouselements of human hair other than carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur.In particular, the inorganic constituents of human hair appear to be receiving someattention because of their potential in diagnostic medicine as described by Maugh[223], and to a lesser degree in forensic science. However, the fact that certaintransition metals such as iron and copper can catalyze the formation of free radicalsin oxidative reactions has picked up interest in cosmetic science too.The mineral content of human hair ﬁbers is generally very low (less than 1%). Itis sometimes difﬁcult to determine whether this inorganic matter is derived from an
extraneous source (which much of it is) or whether it arises during ﬁber synthesis.In addition, many metals of human hair exist as an integral part of the ﬁberstructure, such as salt linkages or coordination complexes with the side chains ofthe proteins or pigments, although the possibility of mineral deposits or compounddeposits as in soap deposition also exists.Pautard [ 224] reported the total ash content of human hair to be as low as 0.26%of the dry weight of the ﬁbers. But, Dutcher and Rothman [ 225] reported ashcontents to vary from 0.55% to 0.94%. Among the trace elements reported in
human hair are Ca, Mg, Sr, B, Al, Na, K, Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Ag, Au, Hg, As, Pb,Sb, Ti, W, V, Mo, I, P, and Se. The actual origin of most of these elements in humanhair is due to a variety of sources that are described below. However, from a studyinvolving quantitative analysis of 13 elements in human hair and in hair washsolutions, Bate et al. [ 226] concluded that a large portion of the trace elements in thehair originate from sweat deposits.In the case of metals, the water supply generally provides calcium and magne-sium to hair. Smart et al. [ 227] reported that oxidation dyed hair washed multiple
times in tap water accumulates high concentrations of metals in the sulfonate richexocuticle of the hair. This nano-scale ion mass spectrometric study providesevidence that calcium binds to the sulfonate groups produced by oxidation. Com-mon transition metals such as iron, manganese and copper also deposit in hair fromthe water supply. Copper from swimming pools has been reported by Bhat et al.[228] to turn blond hair green at low concentrations. Other sources of metals in hairare sweat deposits, diet, air pollution, and metabolic irregularities. Metal contami-nation can also arise from hair products that provide zinc or selenium (antidandruffproducts), potassium, sodium, or magnesium (soaps or shampoos), and even leadfrom lead acetate-containing hair dyes.2.11.1 Transition Metals and Free Radical Reactions
The Transition metals Fe, Cu, Mn, Co and V are very active and can participate inone electron transfer reactions and thereby participate in free radical reactions.162 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
Of these metals, Fe and Cu are the most likely to be found in human hair and will bethe focus of this discussion. As described in Chap. 5, trace quantities of these metalscan participate with either hydrogen peroxide or hydroperoxides formed in hair toform hydroxyl radicals through the Fenton reaction. In addition, free radicals can beformed by direct photolysis of hydroperoxides. Some iron complexes or phenolics[229] or even the excitation of dyes or ﬂuorescent whitening agents in the presenceof one electron donors (Fe, Cu, Mn, Co and V) as described by Millington [ 230] canproduce superoxide radical by a variety of reactions including autoxidation ofmercaptans such as cysteine. Transition metals in hair can be endogenous orexogenous. Exogenous sources are:– The water supply used for bathing and washing hair– Swimming pool water– Airborne pollutantsKempson et al. [ 231] cited a study by Trunova et al. [ 232] who concluded that Cu
and a few other elements are reliable indicators of endogenous consumption, but Feand Ca are not. This citation suggests that Fe and Ca contents of hair are more readilyaffected by environmental inﬂuences than Cu. Cu is involved in two importantmetabolic processes; one in the keratinization of human hair ﬁbers (oxidation ofthiol to disulﬁde) and in the oxidation of tyrosine to melanin involving the enzymetyrosinase which also requires Cu [ 233]. Therefore, Cu is endogenous [ 234] to hairﬁbers. However, Cu can also arise in hair from exogenous sources such as swimmingpool water producing the green hair phenomenon [ 228]. Ca is primarily exogenousin origin. Although Fe and Cu are also exogenous metals, the study by Trunova et al.(above) suggested that the Fe content of hair is inﬂuenced more by exogenoussources than the Cu content of hair [ 232,233]. As indicated earlier, this study byTrunova suggested that Ca and Fe will compete more effectively (not exclusively)
than Cu for acidic sites on hair including sulfonate and carboxylic acid sites.2.11.2 Functional Groups that Bind Speciﬁc MetalsKempson et al. [ 231] reviewed the existence in human hair for metals like Cu andZn with some data on Fe and Ca and other metals. They suggested that Ca has ahigher afﬁnity for carboxylic acid and sulfonate groups than Cu. These samescientists suggested that Cu(II) has a preference for binding with primary aminegroups { /C0NH2} and Cu(I) has a higher afﬁnity for thiol groups { /C0SH}. Kempsonet al. also stated that “perhaps ...Cu and Zn do not form soaps with lipids” in hair,however, Cu is known to form water insoluble soaps in-vitro when reacted withlipids such as butter or with oils such as cottonseed oil or soy bean oil as describedby Berry [ 235]. It may be that Ca has a higher afﬁnity for carboxylic acids andsulfonic acids in hair, but Cu does actually react to form “soaps” with carboxylic
acids, but perhaps to a lesser degree in the presence of Ca.2.11 Trace Metals in Human Hair 163
2.11.3 Regions of the Fiber that have a High Afﬁnity for MetalsRegions of high carboxylic acid content are the endocuticle, the cell membranecomplex (especially the CMC of the cortex) and the medulla. These areas of theﬁber are likely to have a high afﬁnity for divalent and trivalent metals. Therefore,these areas are likely to absorb Ca and Fe with smaller amounts of Cu if the metalscan diffuse to those regions. In the case of oxidation dyed or bleached hair the highcystine containing regions of the ﬁbers (A-layer, exocuticle, cuticle cell membranes,and the matrix of the cortex) will also contain large amounts of sulfonate and willattract Ca and Fe and also Cu. Calcium has been shown by Smart et al. [ 227]t oaccumulate in the sulfonate rich exocuticle of oxidation dyed hair.2.11.3.1 Pigments of Hair Contain High Metal ContentThe pigments of human hair are described as containing more metals than other
regions of the ﬁbers. Dutcher and Rothman [ 225] reported that the iron content inred hair is higher than in hair of other colors, while Kosla et al. [ 236] in WarsawPoland found that hair of schnauzer dogs contains more Fe than hair of humans, butfound no effect of color. Furthermore, Liu et al. [ 237] determined that signiﬁcantamounts of Cu and Zn are bound to both black-hair and red-hair melanosomes,however, the Fe content is four times higher in red-hair melanosomes. Thepigments of human hair are also capable of producing hydroxyl and other freeradicals as shown by Qu et al. [ 238] and also by Haywood [ 239].2.11.4 Simulated Swimming Pool and Copper Binding to HairRhamachandran Bhat et al. [ 228] in an attempt to simulate Cu sorption fromswimming pool water containing copper based algaecide concluded that naturalwhite or lightly bleached blonde hair will absorb Cu from 10 ppm Cu solution asCuSO 4.5H2O at pH 5.9 in chlorox containing water after 1 h. Bleached hair
absorbed more Cu than non-bleached hair, the non-bleached hair turned lightgreen and the bleached hair darker green. In both cases the absorbed Cu was inthe periphery of the hair as shown by EDXA-SEM cross-sections. Interestingly,pre-treatment of the hair with a quaternary ammonium conditioner inhibited thecolor formation in the hair, probably by competitive inhibition. Nevertheless, smallamounts of Cu were still found in the hair with about three times the amount in thelightly bleached hair.164 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
2.11.5 Metals that Bind to Hair do so SpeciﬁcallyAs indicated above, metals like Cu and Fe can bind to polar groups in hair toparticipate in oxidation-reduction reactions by generating active oxygen com-pounds such as in the Fenton or other reactions. They can also bind to groups inhair such as sulfur groups and participate in electron transfer from the metal tosulfur or the reverse. For example, Maletin et al. [ 240] studied the mechanism of theoxidation of copper(I) ions with thiuram disulﬁde and determined that the rate ofthe reaction occurred by one electron transfer from the Cu + ion to the disulﬁde in acomplex of this type [CuI(disulﬁde)]+to form the anion radical of the disulﬁdecomplex. This anion radical then dissociated leading to the formation of a Cu++adduct of the dithiocarbamate. Simpler disulﬁdes (simpler than thiuram disulﬁde)will form a complex of the [CuI(disulﬁde)]+type and then by one electron transfer
will form the anion radical of the disulﬁde complex (or cation radical of thedisulﬁde) which will then dissociate to form the thiyl radical and thiolate anion orthe sulﬁnyl radical (in the case of the cation radical). The thiyl radical or radicalions produced will participate in oxidation reactions as described in this paper toform cysteic acid or other products. Thiuram disulﬁde was selected for this studybecause of its speciﬁc spectroscopic properties.2.11.6 A Proposal for Free Radical Oxidation of Disulﬁdein Hair by Alkaline PeroxideH2O2   +   M       =   (Fenton Reaction)O2O2O2   +  (Cu or Fe)  HO.HO.HO-.--O2.-+   R-S-S-RR-S-O R-SO3→ R-S..-S+R-S...-S+(OH)-R  (Cation radical)     (OH)-ROO-S   S-R   -S-O+++→→ → 2 R RThe disulﬁde cation radical is involved in this reaction scheme because it
involves oxidation by superoxide anion radical for which some evidence has beenprovided in the oxidation of cystine and another disulﬁde with hydrogen peroxide inaqueous solution by Katritzky et al. [ 241]. Misra [ 229] determined that superoxide2.11 Trace Metals in Human Hair 165
can be generated by the autoxidation of a large number of compounds includingthiols [ 229], some iron complexes [ 229] and quinines [ 229]. Millington determinedthat some dyes [ 230] are capable of generating this reactive oxygen species. Inaddition, Bruskov et al. [ 242] generated superoxide anion radical by heating (40/C14C)aqueous buffers saturated with air containing transition metal ion impurities (cop-per and iron) which serve as electron donors. Molecular oxygen could also oxidizethe sulﬁnyl radical to cysteic acid. Other free radical mechanisms along with moredetails on oxidation of the disulﬁde and thioester bonds in hair are described inChap. 5in the section entitled Mechanisms for Free Radical Reactions in HumanHair. If this scheme is involved in the oxidation of keratin by alkaline peroxide itcould explain why alkaline peroxide is more damaging than peroxycarbonate.2.11.7 Heavy (Toxic) Metals in Human Hair
2.11.7 Heavy (Toxic) Metals in Human HairAlthough heavy metals occur at low concentrations in human hair, they sometimesaccumulate at concentrations well above those levels present in blood or urine.Concentrations of metals such as cadmium, arsenic, mercury, and lead in hair tendto correlate with the amounts of these same metals in internal organs [ 223]. This isone of the reasons why hair is being considered as a diagnostic tool. Wesenberget al. [ 243] found a positive correlation between cadmium levels of hair and targetorgans (femur, kidney, liver, spleen, heart, muscle tissue, and adrenal glands ofWister rats). Fowler [ 244] indicated that the highest levels of arsenic in humans arenormally found in hair, nails, and skin. Furthermore, it is well known that humanhair serves as a tissue for the localization of arsenic during arsenic poisoning.Hasan et al. [ 245] reported signiﬁcantly higher levels of nickel, arsenic, cad-
mium and mercury in the hair of children living in urban vs. rural areas of theUnited Arab Emirates. Conclusions were that heavy metal contamination could bedue to industrial activity and that hair analysis has the potential of being an effectivetool for evaluating toxic elements in humans. Heavy metals such as lead can alsoarise from air pollution. For example, Milosevic et al. [ 246] showed signiﬁcantlyhigher concentrations of lead in hair of 200 persons living within 5 km of a leadsmelter plant than in a control group of 200 persons living at a distance more than10 km from that same pollution source.2.11.8 Other Disorders Related to Accumulation of Metalsin Human HairAnalysis of hair can often serve as an indication of even more complicateddisorders. For example, a study by Capel et al. [ 247] indicated signiﬁcantly higher
concentrations of cadmium in hair from dyslexic children than in a normal controlgroup. These scientists suggested that cadmium analysis of hair may be used in166 2 Chemical Composition of Different Hair Types
early detection and that excessive cadmium may be involved in this type of learningdisorder.Dankes [ 248] described Menkes syndrome as being linked to a copper deﬁciencyresulting in abnormal keratinization because copper is involved in the oxidationof cysteine to cystine during keratinization. In this genetic disorder, kinky hairis symptomatic of this disease. This kinky hair results from an unusually highmercaptan level of cysteine, wherein only about 50% of the cysteine is oxidized todisulﬁde bonds during keratinization.Children with cystic ﬁbrosis have been found to contain several times the normallevel of sodium in their hair and considerably less than normal calcium [ 223].Persons suffering from phenylketonuria (phenyl ketones in the urine) contain lessthan average concentrations of calcium and magnesium in their hair [ 223]. Victimsof kwashiorkor have higher than normal levels of zinc in their hair [ 223] and low
levels of sulfur and the cystine rich proteins [ 171]. Hair analysis has also beenconsidered as a screening tool for diabetes, because low levels of chromium in thehair have been demonstrated in victims of juvenile-onset diabetes [ 223]. Hairanalysis offers possibilities for diagnosis of several other maladies or disabilities.For more information on this subject see the review by Maugh [ 223] and the bookedited by Brown and Crounse [ 249].References1.

Chapter 3Genetic Control/Involvement in HairFiber TraitsAbstract The focus in this chapter is on hair form or ﬁber diameter and curvatureand on hair color or pigmentation. These important hair characteristics are con-trolled by single nucleotide polymorphisms which are single nucleotide changes ingenes. The three primary hair forms today (African, Asian and Caucasian) and theirhair pigmentations arose from genetic mutations that are consistent with geographicmigrations of Asians and Caucasians. Therefore, these hair forms and pigmentationsare probably remnants of prior adaptations to temperature, sun exposure and otherenvironmental inﬂuences. Other hair traits related to genetics including differentalopecia and several genetically involved hair abnormalities are described alongwith a brief summary of current directions in forensic science which has expandedinto DNA analysis and is moving into the analysis of SNPs.3.1 Introduction
3.1 IntroductionTraits or characteristics of human hair ﬁbers under genetic control include differenthair forms or shapes such as curvature, ellipticity and coarseness, hair colors orpigmentation, and types of baldness, and hair diseases including certain geneticallyrelated hair abnormalities. In addition, Heywood et al. [ 1] suggested evidence forgenetic involvement in hair quality. These areas are the subject of the followingsections of this chapter. However, the focus of this chapter is on hair form and haircolor or pigmentation with regard to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)which are single nucleotide changes in a gene. Several genetically involved hairabnormalities are also included in this chapter as well as a brief summary of thecurrent direction in forensic science which over the last two decades has expandeddramatically into DNA analysis and is currently moving into the analysis of SNPs.Chapter 2, in the section entitled Major Protein Fractions of Hair and Gene
Expression , contains a summary of the chromosomes and genes for the importantIntermediate Filament proteins (keratin proteins) and KAP (keratin associatedproteins) proteins of human hair.C.R. Robbins, Chemical and Physical Behavior of Human Hair ,DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-25611-0_3, #Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012177
The term race applies to sub-populations or groups of people similar in severalbiological characteristics. In the past, races developed and persisted because travelover large distances was limited, thus, similar peoples interacted and procreated.The geographic or racial differences that are found today in hair and skin type aremost likely remnants of prior adaptations to temperature, sun exposure and otherenvironmental inﬂuences.The words ethnic and ethnicity have been misused in the cosmetic industry.Ethnicity relates more to similarities in or shared social customs. Race relates moreto similarities in physical characteristics. In the following pages I refer to geo-racialor geo-ethnic groups linking geographic origin to race or ethnicity. I will try torefrain from using the phrase ethnic hair, but I will sometimes inadvertently use theterm geo-ethnic group. The cosmetic industry frequently refers to these three
primary geo-racial hair types: African type hair originates primarily from south,west, or central Africa and the donors with a few exceptions tend to have heavilypigmented skin. Asian type hair originates from mid-eastern and south East Asiaand the donors tend to have light to medium skin pigmentation. Caucasian hairoriginates from northern Europe or North Africa and the donors tend to have lightlypigmented skin, but some may have heavily pigmented skin. So, the inﬂuence ofgeography is recognized and persists in this important classiﬁcation because thenames of two of these three groups still retain their geographic origin.These geo-racial groups will be referred to frequently in the sections involvinghair ﬁber shape focusing on ﬁber diameter, ellipticity and hair ﬁber curvature inChap. 9. Fiber curvature and cross-sectional shape as well as pigmentation
variations of human scalp hair are largely controlled genetically. These ﬁbershape characteristics control much of the cosmetic and physical behavior ofhuman hair. Therefore, geo-racial information on hair characteristics can and hasbeen useful to the cosmetic scientist, although a century from now it will likely beless useful than the hair characteristics themselves.Other classiﬁcations such as by curvature type will ultimately become moreimportant to cosmetic science than the three geo-racial groups because curvature isso important to all cosmetic hair assembly properties as discussed in Chap. 10.Consider the fact that the cosmetic behavior of scalp hair of a Caucasian of Curlytype IV hair by the Segmentation Tree Analysis Method (STAM) [ 2] (see thesection entitled , Measuring Hair Fiber Curvature in Chap. 9) has more in commonwith Curl types IV of the African and Asian groups than with a curl Type I or II of
their own geo-racial group. The commonality is in the way their hair behaves withregard to the more important cosmetic hair assembly properties described later inChap. 10.During the latter days of this century and the next, populations of Curl types III,IV and V will likely increase and Curl types I and VIII will decrease. So, in thefuture we must learn to type hair even better by its physical characteristics andbecome more quantitative with regard to its relationships to its important cosmetichair assembly properties. Table 3.1 summarizes the general qualitativecharacteristics of the scalp hair of the three major geo-racial groups.178 3 Genetic Control/Involvement in Hair Fiber Traits
3.2 The Genetics of Hair Form: Hair Diameter and Curvature3.2.1 Evolution to Hairless Bodies, Dark Skin and HighlyCoiled Scalp HairThe current ice age began about 2.6 million years ago producing a large scaleclimate change across the earth. Along with colder temperatures was a decline inrainfall. The densely wooded areas that our early ancestors occupied becametropical or sub-tropical grasslands with scattered trees and drought-resistant under-growth. Consequently, the fruits, tubers and seeds and fresh water that thesevegetarian hominids thrived on became scarce.So, these vegetarians had to change their lifestyle, relocate and mutate tosurvive. They became hunters and ﬁshermen traveling longer distances in searchof food and water [ 5]. The elevated activity required for hunting and traveling for
food and water increased the risk of overheating. So, this hominid adapted by losingits chimpanzee-like body fur. It developed many more sweat glands that were moreefﬁcient (for cooling) over most of its body compared with its chimpanzee-likeancestors. Montagna [ 6] explained that the sweat glands of fur bearing chimpanzeesand gorillas do not respond to heat stimulation as in humans. Equally important, ourancestors’ hairless skin became highly pigmented to protect against over-exposurefrom the sun in the tropics. They developed hair on the head that was highly coiledwith a longer life cycle and therefore of greater length than the head fur of theirpredecessors.Rogers et al. [ 7] concluded from studies of the human MC1R gene, involved inskin and hair pigmentation, that primitive humans lost most of their body hair bybefore 1.2 million years ago. Rogers et al. concluded that loss of fur had to occurbefore dark skin pigmentation because the speciﬁc variant of the MC1R gene that is
always in dark skinned Africans originated about 1.2 million years ago.Jablonski and Chaplin [ 8,9] explained that skin color tends to correlate withlatitude or the region of the earth that determines the intensity of UV radiation.These two scientists explained this effect by the fact that dark skin protects againstthe breakdown of folate which is essential for fertility and fetal development. Darkskin also protects against other but lesser effects with regard to reproductive successTable 3.1 Hair ﬁber characteristics by geo-racial groupFiber characteristics [ 3,4]Geo-race Coarseness Curvature Cross-Sectional Shapte ColorCaucasian Fine Straight tocurlyNearly round to slightlyovalBlond to dark brownAfrican Coarse Wavy to wooly Slightly oval to elliptical Brown-black to blackAsian Coarse Straight towavyNearly round to slightlyovalDark brown to brown-blackSee Fig. 9.183.2 The Genetics of Hair Form: Hair Diameter and Curvature 179
such as protection of sweat glands, from UV damage [ 8], and protection againstskin cancers. Jablonski and Chaplin explained further that humans in differentgeographical regions have evolved to be dark enough to protect folate, in theblood stream, from decomposition by UV-A radiation yet light enough to allowsufﬁcient UV in the skin to catalyze the production of vitamin D, an essentialvitamin for maternal and fetal bones. Furthermore, skin color through tanning ishighly adaptive and can change at a faster rate than hair form or hair color.3.2.2 Helpful Websites for SNP Nomenclature and ItsRelationship to Hair Form and PigmentsSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP’s) are mutations or changes that occur in agene at a speciﬁc location. The nomenclature for SNP’s in the scientiﬁc literature is
variable and complex. Therefore, I recommend the following website as helpful forreading different papers dealing with SNPs because of the many different ways thatgene mutations are described: www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/recs.html .For example, sometimes a coding for the DNA sequence is used which is usuallybut not always described with a “c.” beginning, for example (c.76 A >T) meansthat nucleotide 76 which was Adenine has been replaced by Thymine. Sometimesthe coding is for the corresponding RNA sequence change which would be (r.76a>u) which means that at nucleotide 76 Adenine has been replaced by Uracil.However, more frequently the coding for the protein sequence change will bedesignated. In that case, the coding would be (p.Lys76Asn) or p.K76N or K76Nor 76N which means that at position 76 the amino acid Lysine has been replaced byAsparagine.Another helpful website is: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db ¼snp.
Much information can be obtained from this website including information forthe DNA change, the RNA change and the protein change and much more from thers number.The important thing to remember in all of this discussion is that we are lookingfor changes in speciﬁc genes at speciﬁc locations that create changes in the proteinsthat are derived from these genes. Further, these proteins play a signiﬁcant role inaccelerating or retarding enzymatic or non-enzymatic reactions such as pH control,or the transport of key ingredients involved in the biosynthetic scheme for theformation of hair pigments, hair form or any other trait. In the case of hair pigments,oftentimes the number and size of the melanosomes will be determined and thesewill ultimately become hair pigment granules.To date, more than 100 SNP’s in 24 genes have been shown to be involved in
hair, skin or eye color of humans and many more in mice. Now this is just hair color.Hair and skin color are closely related in a number of ways, however, there aredifferences too. For example, both hair and skin pigments are formed inmelanocytes in structures called melanosomes. Hair and skin pigments both involve180 3 Genetic Control/Involvement in Hair Fiber Traits
many of the same genes. Schwan-Jonczyk [ 10] has shown that melanin granules inhair from people of African descent are larger than those from East Asians whichare larger than those from light haired blonde or red haired Europeans. In skin,melanin is produced in melanocytes similar to those in hair. The melanocytes inAfrican skin appear similar to those in Europeans but they are much more reactiveand the melanin granules that are formed are larger and more numerous in Africans[11] analogous to those in hair.Among the several associations between hair color and skin color are thefollowing: Red heads are almost always fair skinned. However, the reverse is notgenerally true; very light hair people normally have very light skin, however thereverse is not generally true; and dark skin people normally have dark hair, howeverthe reverse is not commonly true.One of the most important differences between hair and skin pigmentation has
been pointed out by Slominski and Tobin [ 12]. For example, Slominski and Tobin[12] described that melanogenesis in hair coordinates with the hair cycle and isaffected strongly by age which ultimately involves the graying of hair. On the otherhand, skin melanogenesis is continuous not cyclic and is not as strongly affected byage. In hair follicles, melanogenic activity is directly related to the anagen stage ofthe hair cycle [ 12]. In the telogen follicle, melanocytes are mitotically quiescent.The complex and large number of biological controls of melanogenesis aresummarized in this paper by Slominski and Tobin [ 12]. These same scientists
suggested that a small number of melanocytes in a single anagen cycle produceenough melanin pigments for a hair shaft of one or more meter or longer. Further-more, single scalp hair follicles continue to produce hair pigments for about 7–15cycles before the onset of graying. Graying is due to a reduction of the activity ofmelanocytes in the hair bulb. See this paper by Slominski and Tobin [ 12] foradditional details on the mechanism of melanogenic activity and graying.3.2.3 Evolution of Coiled Scalp Hair to Straighter Hair FormsThe hair of the people indigenous to Africa today is highly coiled to kinky andhighly elliptical. This hair type was developed several hundred thousand yearsbefore these hominids migrated out of Africa. This highly coiled hair continued tobe the dominant hair form up to the early migrations out of Africa about50,000 years ago [ 13,14]. A primary reason for highly coiled and longer hair on
the scalp in hot tropical high ultraviolet (UV) Africa was to provide a protectiveinsulating layer to the head to help prevent overheating of the brain [ 8]. Thermalprotection of the head was important because prior to these migrations, the brainsize of this hominid increased by a factor of more than two. Furthermore, the head(in addition to the shoulders) is the most directly exposed part of the body tothermal and UV radiation for a bipedal upright animal and thermal protection ofthe brain is much more important than for the shoulders.3.2 The Genetics of Hair Form: Hair Diameter and Curvature 181
Highly coiled hair was preferred over straight hair in the tropics because coiledhair allows more rapid loss of water from the scalp than straight hair. This effect isbecause straight hair ﬁbers mat together with water which inhibits evaporation, andthus inhibits cooling. Highly coiled and longer hair also provides a more effectivethermal insulating layer to the ever increasing brain size. This hominid continued todevelop in its behavior, but changed little in skin and hair development for the nextfew hundred thousand years.Straight, thicker more round hair evolved in the Far East but wavy to straight,less elliptical hair evolved in Europe (less elliptical than African hair). We willspeculate on the advantages of straighter hair in cold climates as possible reasonsfor its evolution; however it is possible that straight hair was linked to anotherproperty like teeth or sweat glands or skin pigmentation and straighter hair just went
along for the ride in a process called phenotypic hitchhiking [ 15].One possible advantage of straight to wavy hair in cold climates is that straighthair grows longer in length than highly coiled African hair primarily because of thefragility of the latter type of hair. Straight hair hangs down over the neck and thesides of the head and ears to cover those body parts more effectively. Therefore,longer straight hair that grows fast provides better thermal protection to the neckand the ears than highly coiled hair. Insulation of the neck (analogous to a scarf)facilitates thermal regulation of the upper spinal cord, while the ears are one ofthe most vulnerable parts of the body to frostbite. Tobin and Paus [ 16] described
the following advantage to long straight hair and attributed this rationale to Hardy.The early migrations of our species to the Far East and Europe occurred along theseacoast, more so to the Far East. Therefore, these migrants survived on a diet highin seafood which contains toxic metals which bind to melanins in hair. Thereforetoxic heavy metals can be detoxiﬁed quickly by selectively binding to melanin inhair which could provide a selective advantage for longer rapidly growing, melaninrich, and straight scalp hair as in Far Easterners.Highly coiled hair is also more effective in scattering radiation and minimizingits contact with the skin an advantage only in the tropics. Iyengar [ 17] proposed and
showed that hair ﬁbers to some extent can function as ﬁber optic strands transmit-ting light to the melanocytes. Furthermore, coiling in optical strands interferes withlight transmission. But, whether or not straight hair ﬁbers can function sufﬁcientlyto transmit a meaningful amount of UV to the skin to facilitate vitamin D produc-tion in clothed humans in northern latitudes remains to be seen. There is noagreement today of whether hair form has occurred by natural selection or if it iscoupled to another trait controlled by selection. But, its geographic speciﬁcity doeslead one to believe that natural selection was somehow involved.3.2.4 The Genes and SNPs Involved in Hair FormThe people of Japan, China and Amerindians have been shown to have a mutationinvolving a simple substitution in the EDAR gene (sometimes referred to as182 3 Genetic Control/Involvement in Hair Fiber Traits
1540T/C or 1540C or 370A) which has been associated with hair thickness of EastAsian and Amerindian populations [ 15,18,19]. In addition, Fujimoto et al. [ 20]determined that the FGFR2 gene is also as sociated with hair thickness in EastAsian populations. Equally important, Mou et al. [ 18] demonstrated that elevationof EDAR activity via this EDAR mutatio n in transgenic mice decreases thenumber of kinks in the hair ﬁbers as well as increasing ﬁber diameter. Thereforethis variant gene is involved in produci ng straighter-more coarse hair in EastAsian populations.This EDAR gene substitution does not occur in Africans and it is at very lowfrequency in most of the people of Central/South Asia, Europe and the Middle Eastas shown by Bryk et al. [ 15] and Fujimoto et al. [ 19]. As of this writing, I have notbeen able to identify whether or not this substitution occurs to a signiﬁcant degree in
the people of India. However, I suspect it only occurs in a small percentage via theTibetan-Burma population in the north-eastern part of India. This conclusion isbased on the fact that the curvature of the main population of India tends to be moreCaucasian-like than East Asian and hair diameter studies on small numbers ofpeople from India suggests that Asiatic Indians do not have hair as coarse as EastAsians.The straight hair of Europeans and East Asians appears to have occurredindependently, analogous to the independent evolution of light skin in Europeansand East Asians after these two groups of humans separated in their respectivemigrations. Migrations to Europe are believed to have occurred about 40,000 yearsago, a few thousand years after migrations to the Far East. As indicated, the thick-straight hair of East Asians is linked to the Asian speciﬁc allele variants of theEDAR and FGFR2 genes [ 19,20]. These gene variants are either not in or at very
low frequencies in the hair of Europeans [ 15]. However, Medland et al. [ 21]demonstrated an association of the trichohyalin gene with straight hair inEuropeans. Furthermore, these trichohyalin gene variants are highest in frequencyin Northern Europeans and are speciﬁc to populations of Europe and western-central Asia. Medland et al. suggested that in this regard, these trichohyalin genevariants “parallel the distribution of the straight-hair EDAR variant in Asianpopulations”.The geographic speciﬁcity of the EDAR gene for hair form in combination withthe trichohyalin gene variants in Europe and the Middle East support the East Asianand West Eurasian Sweeps hypothesis suggested by Coop et al. [ 22]. The EDARgene is at high frequencies in Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese and Amerindian
populations consistent with the geographic migrations of these populations andcontributed to the hair form of the hair type we call Asian. In addition, thetrichohyalin variants in Europeans and Middle Easterners are consistent with themigrations of these populations as suggested by Coop et al. and contributed tothe hair form of the hair type that we call Caucasian. Also see the next section in thisChapter entitled, Hair Pigmentation and Genetics .Another useful study involving hair form was conducted by Eriksson et al. [ 23]where 10,000 European subjects were surveyed with a questionnaire for 223.2 The Genetics of Hair Form: Hair Diameter and Curvature 183
common traits including hair curl, ha i rc o l o ra n dr e dh a i r( r e dt on o tr e do nascale of 4). Hair curl was evaluated with 6/C14of curl based on a verbal descriptionwith accompanying photographs. After the questionnaire saliva samples weretaken from each subject and tested for 580,000 SNP’s. These data were thentested for associations. This study rev ealed four genes with signiﬁcant associa-tion with hair curl in Northern Europeans. Among these four genes was thers17646946 SNP near the Trichohyalin gene (TCHH), the minor allele beingassociated with straighter hair and ﬁrs t implicated with hair curl in Europeansby Medland et al. [ 21]. The rs7349332 SNP near WNT10A, the minor allele (T)was associated with slight ly curlier hair and rs1556547 near OFCC1 was alsoassociated with straight hair.Shimomura et al. [ 24] also suggested with some evidence that the IRS speciﬁcepithial keratin genes KRT71-74 may be involved in the determination of
hair texture, particularly with regard to coiled hair of different mammalianpopulations.3.3 Hair Pigmentation and GeneticsWe know that highly pigmented hair is both geographically/racially related (geo-racially) suggesting genetic involvement. For example those of African and Asianorigin tend to have larger amounts of eumelanin in their hair while those ofCaucasian extraction especially originating from Northern Europe tend to haveless pigment such as eumelanin and more pheomelanin. Schwan-Jonczyk [ 10]suggested that melanin granules are ovoid or spherical and that the size and densityof the granules are smaller and lower in Caucasians; that is the total melanin contentand type of melanin [eumelanin (brown-black) versus pheomelanin (yellow-red)].She concluded that Black African hair contains large agglomerated eumelaningranules about 0.8 mm along their major axis, while Japanese hair has smallermelanin granules about 0.5 mm and blonde European hair contains even smaller
primarily pheomelanin granules about 0.3 mm. These observations on melanin sizeand race are consistent with those by Swift [ 25] for African versus Caucasian hair.Thus, the intensity or depth of color is related to both the size of the melaningranules and the total melanin content (the melanin granule density) while theproportion of eumelanin to pheomelanin is believed to be involved in determiningthe shade of hair color.Melanins are synthesized in melanocytes (melanin producing cells) from theamino acid tyrosine and pheomelanin from tyrosine and cysteine and packaged intomelanosomes in the melanocytes. The melanin containing melanosomes ultimatelybecome melanin granules after being transferred into keratinocytes, cells that formthe shaft of hair ﬁbers. A more complete discussion of the biosynthesis andproposed structures for hair melanins is covered in Chap. 5.184 3 Genetic Control/Involvement in Hair Fiber Traits
3.3.1 Melanin Granules of Different Hair TypesFrom cross-sections of African hair versus dark-brown Caucasian hair the melaningranule density clearly appears higher in African hair. Two papers on melaningranule size and density in human hair, both Japanese papers by Kita et al. [ 26,27],indicated a higher melanin density in the outer cortex versus the inner cortex. Thismelanin distribution effect is also typical of Caucasian and African hair. Thesescientists found no difference in melanin granule size and density in infant hairversus 20–30 year olds, but signiﬁcant differences at age 60–70 wherein the minoraxis of the melanin granules was smaller than for the other age groups. The density(number per square cm) of the melanin granules was lower at the advanced age[26,27].There is a wider range of natural pigment shades for Caucasian hair than for any
other geo-racial group. We know that several genes are involved in the productionof hair pigments. Furthermore, many of these genes function differently in differentpopulations. But, the primary mechanisms of these genes are to control the size,aggregation state and the ratio of eumelanin to pheomelanin in the melanosomeswhich ultimately become the pigment granules of hair ﬁbers.3.3.2 The More Important SNPs and Genes for Hair PigmentsIn 2010 Valenzuela and Brilliant [ 28] described 75 SNP’s in 24 genes that havebeen associated with human or animal pigmentation for hair, skin and or eye color.These scientists analyzed these 75 SNP’s by ANOVA and concluded that 31 werefrom 13 genes associated with either total melanin content or the ratio of eumelaninto pheomelanin in human hair ﬁbers [ 28]. Multiple regression modeling byValenzuela and Brilliant considering SLC24A5, SLC45A2 and HERC2 for totalscalp hair melanin accounted for 76.3% of the variance. Modeling for the ratio of
eumelanin to pheomelanin considering SLC24A5, SLC45A2 and MC1R accountedfor 43.2% of the variance. So, these four genes (SLC24A5, SLC45A2, HERC2 andMC1R) are clearly among the more important genes to hair coloring, see Tables 3.2and3.3. However, since three of these genes, SLC24A5, SLC45A2 and MC1Rexplain less than half of the variance for the ratio of eumelanin to pheomelanin (theshade or color factor) and the fact that other genes are likely linked to the action ofthese genes highlights the fact that genes, in addition to these four, are obviouslyimportant to hair color.Table 3.2summarizes data from a few of the more important genes that havebeen implicated in pigmentation of human hair. At least three of these genes arebelieved to be involved in membrane transport. SLC45A2 produces the membrane-associated transporter protein (MATP) which has been suggested by Yuasa et al.[38] to be involved in the transport of melanosomal proteins to the melanosomes.
The SLC24A5 gene (NCKX5) which stands for Na+/Ca++/K+exchanger 5 has been3.3 Hair Pigmentation and Genetics 185
suggested by Lamason et al. [ 32] to regulate the Ca++concentration in themelanosomes. In addition, the P protein which is encoded by the OCA2 locus isanother multi-transmembrane protein involved in the formation of melanin. Itsfunction is unknown at this time, however, it has been suggested by Chen et al.[39] to involve the transport of tyrosinase (the enzyme involved in the formation ofmelanin pigments from tyrosine). Variants of the MC1R and to some extent theASIP genes have been shown to be involved in determining the ratio of eumelaninto pheomelanin in the melanosomes.Earlier in this chapter in the section on hair form entitled, Evolution of Scalp Hairto Coiled and Straight Hair Forms ,the concept by Coop et al. [ 22] of East Asian and
West Eurasian Sweeps was presented. This concept links genetics to geographicmigrations out of Africa. The ﬁrst migration was to the Far East (China, Korea, Japanand Mongolia) then to the Americas (Amerindians). The second migration wasthrough the Middle East and then westward to Europe forming the Caucasiangroup. The p.A111T (THR111) variant of the SLC24A5 gene for light skin andhair is at a high frequency in Europeans (Caucasians) and at low frequencies in EastAsians and Africans [ 22,31] supporting the East Asian Sweep, see Table 3.2. Whilethe R163Q variant of the MC1R gene for dark hair is at a high frequency in EastAsians and Amerindians and at low frequencies in Europeans and Africanssupporting the West Eurasian Sweep [ 22,37], see Table 3.2.Han et al. [ 40], in 2008, conducted a genome-wide study among more than10,000 European males and females. This study revealed 38 SNPs associated withhair color. The involved gene variants were located on six different chromosomes
and involved eight different genes. Therefore, as Sturm [ 29] suggested, earlieranticipation that human pigmentation is dominated by a few TYR gene mutationsthat could control the formation of melanins has been shown to be a grossTable 3.2 Some important genes/SNP’s involved in hair color for major geo-ethnic groupsFrequencies for populations of these groups (%)Gene SNP/allele variant East Asians Africans CaucasiansSLC45A2 rs16891982 (374L) 98.9 [ 29,30] 98.9 [ 29] 1.7 [ 29]rs16891982 (374F) 1.1 [ 29,30] 1.1 [ 29] 98.3 [ 29]SLC24A5 rs1426654A ¼Thr1111.9 [29]; 36Ŧ[31]4 [ 31] 97.8 [ 30]; 100 Ŧ[31]rs1426654G ¼Ala11193–100 [ 32] 93–100 [ 32]0Ŧ[31]OCA2/HERC2 rs12913832C ¼i86 74 [ 33]rs12913832T 26 €[33]P gene rs1800414(H615R)44 J [ 34]; 54 J [ 35] 100 [ 34] 100 [ 34]54 C [ 35]ASIP rs6058017G(g.8818G)28 [36]8 0 [ 36];60 [29]12 [36]; 24 [ 29]rs6058017A 39.6 [ 29] 75.8 [ 29]MC1R rs885479 (R163Q) 75.5 [ 37]0 [ 37] 4.6 ₰1.6%€[37]rs1805007 (R151C) 0 [ 37] 5.8 [ 37]

[ 23] where 10,000Northern European subjects were surveyed with a questionnaire for 22 commontraits including hair color (blonde to black on a 7 point scale) and red hair (red to notred on a scale of 4 choices (“before I went gray, if I am gray now”)).

Masui et al. [ 34] concluded that the MC1R gene and the P gene can serve asindicators of the origin of individuals in some populations. These scientists startedwith 18 SNP’s, 11 from the MC1R gene and 7 from the P gene and narrowed down to4 SNP’s, the R163Q SNP from MC1R (rs885479) the IVS5+1001, IVS13+113 andH615R (rs1800414) from the P gene. Masui et al. combined the P gene SNP’s versusthe R163Q (rs885479) into a factor called CG which showed clear distinctionbetween Asian populations (Japan, China, Korea and Mongolia combined) versusEuropean or African populations. Interestingly, there appears to be a small distinc-tion between Japanese versus the Chinese, Korean and Mongolian populationscombined also.Of the several genes involved in human hair, skin and eye color, the MC1R genehas shown the largest number of mutations and has been studied most thoroughly. In2008, Savage et al. [ 37] published a paper describing allele frequency data on 55
SNP’s of the MC1R gene from seven geographic populations of 2,306 persons.Savage et al. found a frequency of 75.5% for the R163Q protein (c.488 G >A allelevariant; rs57758262) among 343 Asians including 282 Japanese and 50 Chinesewith frequencies less than 5% for any other group for this same protein-allele. Thenext MC1R allele with a high frequency was for the T314T protein produced bythe c.942 A >G allele; a dark hair allele with a frequency of 44.4% for the Africanpopulation of 117 subjects 13.3% for the Asian group, 13.2% for the Asiatic Indiansand 18.75% for the Papua New Guinea population [ 37].A variety of different hair colors can be produced by different genotypes of theMC1R alleles. Among the MC1R alleles of Table 3.3, the homogeneous wild type
(the consensus or most common) produces the highest percentage of black hair. Ofthe MC1R variants, the r variants do not produce red hair, but only dark brown toblonde hair. The heterozygous wild type with r and the homogeneous r/r genotypesproduce from 75% to 92% dark brown to black hair. On the other hand, the Rvariants produce increasing percentages of red hair from 21% to 75% of thesubjects with the highest percentage for the R/R homozygous subjects.Lu et al. [ 41] showed that the MC1R gene can function to produce lighter shades ofpigment via agouti-signaling involving another gene variant that produces a proteinthat antagonizes or inhibits the a-melanocyte stimulating hormone ( a-MSH).Valverde et al. [ 42] in 1995 concluded that mutations of the MC1R gene are involvedin red hair formation in humans and the mechanism involves increasing the ratio ofpheomelanin to eumelanin in the melanosomes. This type of genetic variation is
highest among Europeans with red hair and fair skin [ 43]. Branicki et al. [ 43]determined that at least 5 MC1R variants are involved in red hair production:C451T (rs1805007) providing an amino acid change of p.R151C, C478T(rs1805008) providing an amino acid change of R160W, C252A, (rs1805006)providing an amino acid change of D84E, G425A providing an amino acid changeof R142H and G880C providing an amino acid change of D294H (rs1805009).The major role was played by the ﬁrst two of these gene variants for people ofPolish descent and has been show by Savage et al. [ 37] to be at higher frequenciesamong European and US populations. The C451T variant has been shown bySavage et al. to occur at 5.6% in Northern Europeans, at 3.16% in Southern188 3 Genetic Control/Involvement in Hair Fiber Traits
Europeans and at 6.42% in the United States while the C478T variant at 8.3% inNorthern Europe, at 1.9% in Southern Europe and at 7.2% in the United States. Boxet al. [ 44] showed that the G178T variant (rs1805005) that provides an amino acidchange of p.V60L is associated with fair or blond and light brown hair. This varianthas been shown by Savage et al. [ 37] to occur at a frequency of 10.7% in NorthernEuropeans, at 15.75% in Southern Europeans and at 13.21% in the United States.Savage et al. [ 37] and others described that in most regions of the genome thereis greater genetic variation in African populations than most other populations. Butthe MC1R gene is an exception to this rule of thumb. This exception occurs becauseof the greater variation in hair pigments and skin pigments of people of Europeandescent versus those of African descent.Kanetsky et al. [ 45] provided evidence that the ASIP gene is also involved in the
production of dark hair and brown eyes in European Americans. Bonilla et al. [ 46]suggested that the speciﬁc SNP of the ASIP gene described as g.8818A >G (SNP#rs6058017) is believed to function by producing a protein that binds to MC1R andpromotes formation of eumelanin and darker skin color in African Americans.Zeigler-Johnson et al. [ 36] demonstrated that the allele of ASIP g.8818 G isinvolved in this type of agouti-signaling to promote eumelanin production andoccurs at a high frequency (0.80) in West Africans, at 0.62 in African Americans,0.28 in East Asians and at a frequency of 0.12 in European Americans. Hardinget al. [ 47] concluded that the MC1R gene is “under strong functional constraint inAfrica” and any change would be harmful from an evolutionary perspective.Branicki et al. [ 48] demonstrated that the SLC45A2 gene also called MATP for
membrane associated transporter protein is involved in hair color and in particularthe L374 allele signiﬁcantly increases the likelihood of black hair color inEuropeans. The L374F (rs16891982, c.1122C >G) polymorphism of SLC45A2has been suggested by Yuasa et al. [ 38] as a possible important factor in hypo-pigmentation in Caucasian populations. This SNP occurs at a high frequency inGerman, French and Italian populations and is virtually absent in African and EastAsian populations [ 38]. It also occurs at low frequencies in Indians from New Delhi(14.7%) and Bangladeshi (5.9%) important populations of India.The SLC24A5 gene has been found to affect pigmentation in zebraﬁsh andhumans and has been implicated in hair color by Lamason et al. [ 32] and conﬁrmedby Valenzuela and Brilliant et al. [ 28]. The frequency for the p.A111T (rs63750629,c.331G >A) has been shown to be high in European populations (0.975) and lowin Chinese (0.019) by Soejima and Koda [ 30].
in Chinese (0.019) by Soejima and Koda [ 30].The HERC2 gene sometimes called OCA2/HERC2 (Table 3.2) has beensuggested by Sulem et al. [ 49] to be involved in expression of the OCA2 genethat reduces pigmentation in the hair of Europeans. The rs12913832 allele of theHERC2 gene has been shown by Valenzuela and Brilliant [ 28] to be involved inhair pigmentation and by Eiberg et al. [ 50] to be involved in brown eye color byinhibiting OCA2 expression. The OCA2 gene is involved in the most common formof albinism. Rebbeck et al. [ 51] determined that mutations of the P gene are alsoinvolved in eye color by association of these mutations with the OCA2 gene.3.3 Hair Pigmentation and Genetics 189
3.4 Some Other Hair Traits Related to GeneticsShimomura and Christiano [ 52] reviewed genetically involved hair diseases in acomprehensive review entitled, Biology and Genetics of Hair . I refer the interestedreader to this review for a description of several more hair diseases with geneticinvolvement than are described in this chapter. The most interesting to this authorare the possible connections to the development of “normal” non-diseased hair suchas those involved in pigmentation (in the previous section) and hair form. Oneexample is the paper by Shimomura et al. [ 24] suggesting the possible involvementof IRS speciﬁc epithial keratin genes KRT71-74 in the determination of hairtexture, particularly with regard to coiled hair of different mammalian populations.With respect to androgenetic alopecia, the most common form of hair loss,several genes have been implicated. Hillmer et al. [ 53] demonstrated that the
androgen receptor gene (AR) on the X chromosome is the primary requirementfor early-onset androgenetic alopecia. The fact that location of this important geneis on the X-chromosome signiﬁes the signiﬁcance of the maternal line to androge-netic alopecia. A genome wide linkage study by Hillmer et al. [ 54] of 95 families ofGerman descent provided evidence for linkage to chromosome 3q26. The suscepti-bility to male pattern baldness has also been shown to relate to ﬁve SNPs onchromosome 20pll by Brent Richards et al. [ 55] and Hillmer et al. [ 56]. Thisstudy by Hillmer et al. [ 56] suggested no interaction with the androgen receptoron the X-chromosome suggesting an androgen independent role from the product ofthese genes. Chromosomes 5 and 2 which harbor genes encoding the two 5 a-reduction isoenzymes were found by Ellis et al. [ 57] to not be associated with
male pattern baldness, therefore, the authors suggested that a “polygenic etiologyshould be considered” for the role of 5 a-reductase in male pattern baldness.Ahmed and Christiano et al. [ 58] identiﬁed a hairless gene (hr) on chromosome8p12 that is associated with alopecia universalis in humans and Nothen et al. [ 59]have mapped the locus on chromosome 8p21-22. Martinez-Mir and Christiano et al.[60] have conducted a genome wide scan for linkage to alopecia areata implicatingat least four susceptible loci on chromosomes 6, 10, 16 and 18 using more than onestatistical approach.Heywood et al. [ 1] working with hair from 292 female Caucasians characterizedthe hair of these subjects by amino acid analysis, dry tensile elastic modulus,two-dimensional electrophoresis of hair protein extracts and the perception of
hair quality by the panelists themselves. The results from protein analysis provideda string of 66 kDa proteins that correlated with higher perceived hair quality. Thesescientists also noted a decrease in the low molecular weight (14–29 kDa) proteinswith the use of hair coloring products.Amino acid analysis revealed that the perception of hair quality was associatedwith higher levels of the amino acids serine and threonine. Higher elastic moduluswas signiﬁcantly higher in hair of higher perceived quality. Serine is an amino acidthat occurs at very high levels in the ultra high sulfur proteins of hair. There are alsothreonine rich keratin associated proteins [ 61]. Therefore, higher concentrations of190 3 Genetic Control/Involvement in Hair Fiber Traits
these amino acids may suggest higher concentrations of the ultra high sulfurproteins or related keratin associated proteins which are likely under geneticcontrol. From these results, these scientists hypothesized that hair quality is likelyto be genetically determined.3.5 Hair AbnormalitiesAbnormalities in this section are classiﬁed as diseases involving growths on the hairand diseases of genetic origin that affect the structure of the hair ﬁber. Lice andPiedra are discussed in the last part of this section because they produce nodules onthe hair shaft as well as affect the scalp in contrast to dandruff, a disease primarilyof the scalp discussed in Chap. 6.The sections in Chap. 1entitled Intermediate Filaments and in Chap. 2entitledType I and Type II Keratin Proteins (IF Proteins) of Human Hair discusses only theType I acidic keratins and the Type II neutral-basic keratins that are essentialstructures of the human hair ﬁber. Langbein and Schweitzer [ 62] described that
IF proteins of human hair are involved in a few diseases such as monilethrix andcertain hair follicle derived tumors. Six different types of IF proteins are describedin the review paper on intermediate ﬁlaments and disease authored by Erikssonet al. [ 63]. Type III IF proteins include vimentin and desmin, Type IV IF proteinsinclude nestin, synemin and the neuroﬁlament triplet proteins, Type V IF proteinsare the nuclear lamins and Type VI IF proteins of the eye lens cell are not
considered in the discussion in this current Chapter. Nevertheless IF familymembers all share a central helical coiled-coil rod with variable Nitrogen andCarbon terminal groups that provides huge structural diversity. The IFs of humanhair ﬁber are structural proteins while the other IF types are located in epithelia,muscle, neuron and eye lens cells. To date, the IF proteins of human hair ﬁberinvolve a few defective keratins in hair ﬁbers and a few hair follicle derived tumors[63]. Numerous diseases of other tissues involve these other Types of IF proteinsand include neurodegenerative diseases such as Lou Gehrig’s disease, andParkinson’s disease, muscular dystrophy, liver disease and cataracts [ 63] allconnected in some way to Intermediate Filaments.Monilethrix, pili torti, pili annulati, trichorrhexis nodosa, Menke’s disease and
trichothiodystrophy are somewhat rare structural anomalies in human hair undergenetic inﬂuence. The structural changes occurring in these anomalies are so largethat they may be observed microscopically.Monilethrix is a congenital, hereditary disease resulting in abnormal humanscalp hair. Monilethrix is also called moniliform hair or beaded hair, and it produceshair ﬁbers with the appearance of a twisted ribbon, as illustrated by the lightmicrograph of Fig. 3.1. However, in spite of its casual appearance detailed exami-nation shows that monilethrix does not exhibit severe twists and it is thus distin-guishable from pili torti. This disease is also characterized by dry, fragile hair ﬁbers.Therefore, in monilethrix, hair length generally does not exceed a few centimeters,3.5 Hair Abnormalities 191
particularly hair with narrow internodes. Healy et al. [ 64] studied two families withautosomal dominant monilethrix and excluded linkage to the type I keratin genecluster on 17q, but provided evidence that this disorder is linked to the type IIkeratin cluster on 12q. Genes for basic trichocyte keratins are found on this lattergene. Congenital monilethrix produces defects in keratin intermediate ﬁlaments(hHb6 and hHb1) [ 62], the ﬁlamentous proteins in the cortex, see this paper byLangbein and Schweitzer [ 62] and the references therein. The most frequentmutations for monilethrix are E413K, E402K and E413D for hHb6 and E402Kfor hHb1 although other less frequent mutations have been described [ 62]. Thesemutations interfere with assembly or adhesion of the coiled coil dimers in theintermediate ﬁlaments resulting in very brittle, dry hair. Langbein and Schweitzer[62] concluded further that in addition to monilethrix those potential hair disorder
candidates for the inability of mutated keratin proteins to form stable IF structuresinclude pili annulati, wooly hair, numerous hypotrichoses and nail diseases.Pili torti is a rare congenital deformity of the hair characterized by ﬂattenedﬁbers with multiple extensive twists. In some cases, the hair grows to a normallength, although frequently this deformity produces short, twisted, broken hairspresenting the appearance of stubble. Pili torti provides a high frequency of rotation(usually about 180/C14) and can resemble mildly affected monilethrix hair shafts (seeFig. 3.2) but its distinguishable by the severe twists of pili torti which show upbetter in SEM than in light microscopy see Fig. 3.3. Figure 3.3shows three differentpili torti hairs compared with one monilethrix hair. The extremely twisted hairon the left has been called corkscrew hair by Whiting et al. [ 65]. Price [ 66]
identiﬁed two human DXL genes in the TDO locus (DLX3 and DLX7) andidentiﬁed mutations in DLX3 in tricho-dento-osseous (TDO) syndrome patients.These genes are located on chromosome 17q21. TDO syndrome exhibits kinkycurly hair, thin-pitted enamel, taurodontism and thickening of cortical bone.Fig. 3.1 Monilethrix, a congenital and hereditary structural anomaly of human scalp hair (Kindlyprovided by John T. Wilson)192 3 Genetic Control/Involvement in Hair Fiber Traits
Figure 3.4illustrates Pili annulati, sometimes called ringed hair. Ringed hair is arare hereditary condition characterized by alternating light and dark bands along thehair ﬁber axis described in the previous section entitled, Medull a. Giehl et al. [ 67]studied three families with 40 subjects affected by pili annulati to narrow the locuswhich was mapped to chromosome 12q24.34-24.33. These scientists “reduced thecritical interval of pili annulati to 2.9 Mb”. They also used sequence analysis toexclude mutations in the coding region of 36 potential candidate genes.Fig. 3.2 Pili torti, an uncommon hair shaft anomaly, see also Fig. 9.12 (Kindly provided by JohnT. Wilson)Fig. 3.3 Three different pilitorti hairs and onemonilethrix hair [ 58](Reprinted with permission ofPraeger Publishers, NewYork, NY)3.5 Hair Abnormalities 193
Netherton’s syndrome is a skin disorder characterized by several hair shaftabnormalities two of which provide the appearance of nodes on the hair.Trichorrhexis invaginata involves the invagination of a short portion of the rootof the hair into a short part of the tip of the hair providing the appearance of a node.Trichorrhexis nodosa forms the appearance of nodes on the hair provided byexpansion of the cortical cell/cell membrane complex regions. These nodes areusually, but not always, fragile regions along the hair shaft. Dermatologists oftenrefer to fragile hair as “Acquired trichorrhexis nodosa” and separate it into twodisorders. Hairs with Proximal trichorrhexis nodosa break near the scalp. Thiscondition is more common in African hair. Proximal trichorrhexis nodosa isexacerbated by hair straightening and braiding.Distal trichorrhexis nodosa is more common in European or Asian hair with
breaks occurring closer to the tips. This disease is exacerbated by chemicaltreatments, prolonged sun exposure and mechanical stress. It is often correctedover time and can be helped by the use of conditioners and care. Congenitaltrichorrhexis nodosa is a genetic disease involving a disorder of the urea cycleproducing multiple nodes along the hair shaft, see Fig. 3.5. This genetic disorderoccurs more often in facial hair than scalp hair, and produces bulbous type nodesappearing as irregular thickenings along the hair shaft. These nodes are actuallypartial fractures, which under stress crack more completely forming broom-likebreaks illustrated by Fig. 3.6. Netherton’s disease or syndrome has been shown byBitoun et al. [ 68] to involve mutations of SPINK5 as the defective gene on chromo-some 5q32 encoding the serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 protein (LEKTI).Menke’s syndrome is a genetic disorder producing very kinky human hair in
which the sulphydryl groups are only partly converted to disulﬁde bonds (about50% oxidized) and is linked to a copper deﬁciency caused by a mutation in a proteininvolved in copper transport. Another symptom of Menke’s syndrome is deteriora-tion of the nervous system. Menke’s syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorderinvolving a gene that encodes a copper-transporting ATPase located at Xq13 asFig. 3.4 Pili annulati (ringed hair). An uncommon inherited hair shaft anomaly (Kindly providedby John T. Wilson)194 3 Genetic Control/Involvement in Hair Fiber Traits
shown by Vulpe et al. [ 69]. Menke’s kinky hair disorder occurs primarily on malesbecause males have only one X chromosome and the probability for both Xchromosomes of a female being affected is very low. Subcutaneous injections ofcopper if done early are sometimes helpful.Fig. 3.5 An intact hair ﬁber illustrating the condition of trichorrhexis nodosa (Kindly provided byJohn T. Wilson)Fig. 3.6 Trichorrhexis nodosa. “Broomlike” fractures at the “nodes” are symptoms of this hairshaft anomaly (Kindly provided by John T. Wilson)3.5 Hair Abnormalities 195
Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) is a number of syndromes affecting both the hair andthe nails and other organs resulting from mutations producing sparse and brittlehair, nail dystrophy, mental and growth retardation, ichthyosis, decreased fertilityand cutaneous photosensitivity. There are several forms of nonphotosensitive TTDand photosensitive TTD. Amish brittle-hair syndrome is characterized by shortstature, mental retardation, hair with very low sulfur content and decreased malefertility. Other forms of nonphotosensitive TTD include Pollitt syndrome andSabinas brittle-hair syndrome with similar clinical conditions. Nakabayashi et al.[70] determined one gene involved in nonphotosensitive TTD as C7orf11 whichmaps to chromosome 7p14 and is expressed in hair follicles. In TTD the haircontains only about one half the cystine content of normal hair. Such low cystinecross-link levels account for the brittleness of the hair in this disorder.
Jones and Rivett [ 71] described maple syrup urine disease or branched chainketo-aciduria (MSUD) as a rare genetic defect involving a lack of the enzyme thatsynthesizes 18-methyl eicosanoic acid from isoleucine. This enzyme is involved in anecessary biological process for eliminating excessive branched chain amino acidsfrom the body. In MSUD, branched chain amino acids can build up to toxic levels.Some of the symptoms of MSUD are maple syrup odor in cerumen at 12–24 h afterbirth, elevated levels of branched chain amino acids by 12–24 h, ketonuria, irritabilityand poor feeding by 2–3 days and in some cases coma and respiratory failure by7–10 days [ 72]. Strauss et al. [ 72] in their thorough review of MSUD describe three
types of MSUD, the disease characteristics, diagnosis and testing and treatment as wellas its genetic basis. MSUD Type I involves the chromosomal locus 19q13.1-q13.2 andthe gene symbol BCKDHA and is found in certain Mennonite populations. MSUDType II involves the chromosomal locus 6q14 and the gene symbol BCKDHB and hasbeen found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. MSUD Type III involves the chro-mosomal locus 1p31 and the gene symbol DBT.MSUD patients lack 18-methyl eicosanoic acid in hair. In MSUD, this uniquebranched chain fatty acid is substituted by linear saturated fatty acids, mainly C16,C18 and C20. Smith and Swift [ 73] found that hair from persons with MSUD doesnot cleave cleanly at the Beta-Delta layers as with normal hair and therefore itprovides more endocuticular failure. MSUD is described in more detail in Chapter 1in the section entitled “The cuticle-cuticle CMC”.Lice and Piedra are two diseases that occur primarily, but not exclusively among
pre-pubertal children. Both of these diseases produce nodules on hair shafts thatcontain eggs for the former and spores for the latter.Lice nodules may appear on hair on most areas of the body, such as the scalp, theeyebrows or even the pubic region (crabs). The human head louse, Pediculuscapitis , is a very small wingless parasitic insect that survives on the blood ofhumans. The louse has a ﬂattened body, about 3 mm long, with a claw on the endof each leg which it uses to cling to the hair of its host. Female lice lay whitish eggscalled nits. The nits are bound to the hair of the host with an adhesive material.In most cases it is easier to ﬁnd nits than adult lice because of the immobility of theformer and the high mobility of the latter. Nits are generally laid close to the scalp.Since nits are “permanently” attached to the hair shaft, they can be found near the196 3 Genetic Control/Involvement in Hair Fiber Traits
tip ends of long hair from growth, after long attachment times. The eggs hatch inabout a week after attachment. Three molts in only 2–3 weeks’ produces a matureadult louse. Figure 3.7is a light micrograph illustrating the empty nit sacs of thehuman head louse.When the insect bites the host a small amount of a mild toxin is released. Thebite usually leaves a tiny red spot that with scratching can cause larger sores. Louseinfection occurs frequently and should be considered as a possible causative agentin cases of prolonged scalp itching. The resultant pruritus can lead to excoriationand secondary infection. After several bites the victims may become sensitized tothe toxin. Lice are also capable of transmitting several diseases including typhusand relapsing fever.Lice infection is usually treated by shampooing and combing frequently with aﬁne tooth comb to remove the nit sacs. Re-treatment in 7–10 days is essential to
remove or kill the lice that hatch from the nits. Rubbing a product containing aninsecticide into the hair and the scalp is even more effective. It is usuallyrecommended to apply the treatment at night and to shampoo in the morning andthen to repeat treatment in 7–10 days. Products are shampoos, cre `me rinses andhair/scalp creams. Leave in products are more effective than shampoos. Cre `merinses are claimed to help remove nit sacs because they facilitate the comb out.Insecticides such as permethrin, benzyl benzoate, lindane and pyrethrin have beenused to treat lice. Pyrethrins are insecticides initially derived from certain species ofchrysanthemum ﬂowers. Synthetic pyrethroid insecticide is more stable with a similar
activity and low mammalian toxicity and is called permethrin. Lindane (1,2,3,4,5,6hexachlorocyclohexane) and benzyl benzoate have also been used as Pediculocides.Lice infection is spread by direct contact or by wearing the clothing of an infectedperson. The control of secondary bacterial infection may require an antibiotic.Black Piedra “black stone” is caused by Piedraia hortai , a fungus that can affectscalp hair, and sometimes beard mustache or even body hair. This fungus penetratesFig. 3.7 Light micrograph illustrating empty nits of the head louse Pediculus capitis on a humanscalp hair (Kindly provided by John T. Wilson)3.5 Hair Abnormalities 197
the cuticle resulting in adherent rough or granular black to brown nodules (seeFig.3.8) that can be observed microscopically or even with the naked eye. Thesepenetrating nodules can weaken the hair shaft and even lead to hair shaft fractures.White Piedra is caused by Trichosporin beigelii , another fungus, and is found moreoften in pubic hair than in scalp hair. White Piedra can also weaken hair ﬁbers andproduce fractures. The whitish nodules from this fungus are easy to remove from the
hair ﬁber, but are usually full of fungal spores. Black or white Piedra can be identiﬁedor diagnosed by microscopic examination or by cultures from infected hairs. Piedrausually occurs in tropical or humid climates such as tropical South America; however,white Piedra has also been identiﬁed in certain parts of Europe. Antidandruff productscontaining strong fungicides should be effective against Piedra. See the antidandruffsection in Chap. 6for a description of the most effective fungicides in hair products.For additional details relevant to these hair shaft anomalies, see the review paperby Shimomura and Christiano [ 52] and the book edited by Brown and Crounse [ 74].3.6 Hair Analysis for Drugs and Forensic StudiesHair analysis for drugs of abuse has been described to detect cocaine [ 75–77],marijuana [ 75], nicotine [ 78], opiates [ 79] and amphetamines [ 78–81]. Originally
drugs were extracted from the hair followed by gas chromatographic/mass spectro-photometric (GC/MS) analysis for the drug. More recently, the hair is dissolved andantibodies used in radioimmunoassay (RIA) act as speciﬁc agents for extraction/analysis [ 77,82,83]. The analysis is generally by GC/MS. Some distinctadvantages exist in hair analysis over urinalysis, such as the detection of longterm drug usage is more readily identiﬁed. However, drug usage over the mostrecent few days is not detectable by hair analysis. All analytical methods havelimits. Although, hair analysis does appear to offer potential, however, the limits forhair analysis are still in the process of being deﬁned [ 82].Fig. 3.8 Light micrograph ofthe spore sacs of the BlackPiedra fungus on a humanhair ﬁber198 3 Genetic Control/Involvement in Hair Fiber Traits
A review of hair analysis for drugs of abuse is provided in the paper byBaumgartner [ 83] addressing some of these limits. Hair analysis for drugs ofabuse such as ethyl alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, ecstasy opiates,etc. can be determined [ 84]. If scalp hair is not available, hair from other areas of thebody such as armpit, eyebrow, pubic or facial hair can be used; although differencesin growth rates must be taken into consideration. Kelly et al. [ 85] examined hairanalysis for three drugs, amphetamines, cocaine and cannabinoids and determinedthere is no bias introduced by hair color or racial effects for hair analysis of thosedrugs. One concern expressed in the literature for hair analysis deals with thepotential for false positives created by contamination by passive environmentalexposure, e.g. smoking of PCP or marijuana, etc. The review by Baumgartnerspeaks to this concern by pre-washing the hair to remove the passive contaminants
and not the material deposited in the cortex through the bloodstream. For example,environmental contamination via passive smoke exposure should provide for onlysuperﬁcial sorption near the surface rather than deeply penetrated drugs takeninternally.3.6.1 Forensic Studies and DNA AnalysisHair ﬁbers are frequently found at crime scenes, and they are usually evaluated ﬁrstfor a large number of macroscopic and microscopic comparisons for identiﬁcationas described by Gaudette [ 86,87]. Characteristics such as color, pigment size,pigment distribution, pigment density, whether the ﬁber has been dyed, type ofmedulla, maximum and minimum diameter, type of cut at tip, length, scale count,and various cross-sectional characteristics are used in this evaluation. Such
comparisons have been invaluable for either excluding or incriminating suspectsin crimes. However, more recently, several newer techniques have been developedincluding blood group analysis [ 77], DNA analysis [ 88–95], and drug analysis (seethe previous section), that together provide for even more conclusive evidence foreither excluding or targeting a suspect.For some DNA analysis, the specimen must be either plucked or shed, because itmust contain root or root sheath material for DNA to be extracted for furtherworkup and identiﬁcation. ‘Extraction of DNA from the biological specimen hasbeen described by Walsh et al. (of the Roche Molecular Systems, Emeryville, CA)[93]. After extraction, two methods are used for further analysis: restriction frag-ment length polymorphism (RFLP) [ 88] and the technique, polymerase chainreaction (PCR). The RFLP technique [ 88] was the ﬁrst one developed and provided
a very high discriminating power because it discriminates by size and the number ofthe fragment lengths of the DNA sample. However, it cannot be used with highlydegraded DNA and requires much more DNA material than the PCR technique,generally more than is provided by a single hair ﬁber. So, primarily because ofmuch higher sensitivity, the PCR method has replaced the RFLP method [ 96].3.6 Hair Analysis for Drugs and Forensic Studies 199
The PCR technique offers many advantages because it requires minimalamounts of DNA and even permits typing from degraded DNA. It can even beused on single hairs as shown by Higuchi et al. [ 90]. PCR analysis even permitsDNA analysis over a large area of the hair shaft itself. For example, Heywood et al.[97] have shown that PCR ampliﬁcation permits DNA to be found even in root endand tip ends of hair, although there are higher levels in the root end. These samescientists also found that hair treated with permanent hair colorants provide lowerlevels of DNA and surfactant washing also decreases DNA.After extraction, the PCR technique is used to replicate speciﬁc sections of astrand of DNA to increase the amount of material for analysis. (For furtherinformation, see bulletins describing the Gene Amp Polymerase Chain reactionTechnology and the AmpliType HLA DQ aForensic Typing Kit available from theCetus Corporation, Emeryville, CA).
Cetus Corporation, Emeryville, CA).Budowle and van Daal [ 96] describe that the discrimination power of currentPCR analysis has been increased by amplifying the typing of variable number oftandem repeat (VNTR) loci. The allele forms are then separated by electrophoresisand detected by silver staining [ 97]. Part of a subclass of the VNTR loci hasreplaced the earlier markers. These new markers or short tandem repeats (STRs)are now used worldwide [ 98–101]. Because the fragment length of the requiredDNA is much smaller than in the past (about less than 350 base pairs) somedegraded samples are now capable of being typed. The analysis used today issometimes called multiplex autosomal STR loci [ 101]. This procedure provideshigh sensitivity, speciﬁcity and the capability to analyze small and degradedsamples in a semi-automated manner.Even newer techniques are under development to permit quantitation and even
faster and more convenient qualitative identiﬁcation of DNA for forensic, archaeo-logical, and clinical research [ 79,80].Another type of genetic marker that shows promise for typing degraded samplesinvolves SNPs. SNPs are single nucleotide polymorphisms or a portion of DNAwhere one nucleotide base has been changed, inserted or deleted. It is not likely thatSNPs will ever become the primary forensic markers but they show promise toprovide useful forensic information especially on degraded samples. For additionalinformation on SNPs in forensic research see the review paper by Budowle and vanDaal [ 96] and the sections in this Chapter entitled Evolution of Scalp Hair to Coiledand Straight Hair Forms andHair Pigmentation and Genetics .References1.

Chapter 4Reducing Human Hair Including PermanentWaving and StraighteningAbstract The physical chemistry of the primary reactions involved in permanentwaving and reductive and alkaline straightening and depilation of human hair aredescribed in detail focusing on the disulﬁde bond its reduction/degradation, neu-tralization and subsequent reactions. The inﬂuence of mercaptan structure, excessreactant, pH and cysteine in different parts of the ﬁber on the chemical equilibriumin this reaction is explained. Factors affecting the kinetics of this reaction such asmercaptan structure, temperature, different hair types, hair swelling and hair con-
dition, counterion effects, other reducing agents such as sulﬁte or bisulﬁte andside reactions of the reduction process are also described. The chemistry of alkalinestraightening is contrasted to permanent waving including the importance ofsupercontraction to its permanence. Discussion of water setting, set and supercon-traction and the swelling of hair (primarily transverse changes in the ﬁber) atdifferent stages of these processes are also considered. The current understandingof chemical changes to the different morphological regions of hair, the cuticle, thecell membrane complex and the cortex of hair produced by these reactions is alsodescribed.4.1 Introduction
described.4.1 IntroductionSigniﬁcant additions to our understanding of chemical changes to the cuticle, thecell membranes, and the cortex produced by permanent waves have been added tothis Chapter. In addition, thermal reconditioning or Japanese hair straightening whichhas been used in beauty salons has been added. Furthermore, the section on hairstraightening has been expanded to include more on the mechanism of several differentstraightening methods and papers dealing with damage to hair by straighteners.The primary reactions involved in permanent waving, reductive and alkalinestraightening products and depilation of human hair begin with reduction orcleavage of the disulﬁde bond. In perm anent waving and reductive hair straight-ening, reduced hair is stressed, i.e., curled or combed straight, while molecularC.R.

reorganization occurs somehow involving the intermediate ﬁlaments through adisulﬁde-mercaptan interchange process. Neutralization is then achieved eitherthrough mild oxidation or treatment with alkali (for some sulﬁte treatments).Since reduction of the disulﬁde bond and its subsequent reactions are vital to severalimportant cosmetic products, a large amount of research has been conducted that isrelevant to those processes. This chapter is concerned with reducing the disulﬁde bondin hair by mercaptans, sulﬁtes, alkalies and other reducing agents. Reactions of reducedhair are also considered, followed by a discussion of water setting, set and supercon-traction, and swelling of hair, followed by an expanded section on hair straighteners,depilatories and concluding with a section on safety of these products.In spite of the fact that research on permanent waving has decreased over thepast several decades, signiﬁcant ﬁndings have been made in this ﬁeld within the
past three decades. For example, Wortmann and Kure [ 1,2] have developed amodel and extended it to show that the bending stiffness of reduced and oxidizedﬁbers controls the permanent waving behavior of human hair and that the cuticleplays a role in permanent waving. Further, these authors have shown that the cuticlefunctions not only as a barrier to reduction but its stiffness also contributes to ﬁberset. In addition, Wortmann and Souren [ 3] have suggested that reorganization in theintermediate ﬁlaments is important to a permanent wave set. Our understanding ofhair straightening has been expanded showing that supercontraction is essential topermanent hair straightening.Work on fracturing reduced and oxidized-reduced keratin ﬁbers at Textile
Research Institute-Princeton provides some useful insights into damage by thesereactions and a promising new test is offered to study damage to the cell membranecomplex by reductive and oxidative systems. The permanent-waving process isconsidered in detail in this chapter including the model by Wortmann and Kure anda second useful model by Feughelman [ 4] followed by several cold wavecompositions and procedures for making these same products in the laboratory.In addition several micrographs are included illustrating damage by reducing agentsto the proteins of hair including the cell membrane complex and how these actionslead to the interesting phenomenon of scale lifting. The last section of this chapteras in previous editions describes literature relevant to the safety of reducing agentsand permanent-wave products.4.2 Reduction of the Disulﬁde Bond4.2.1 Equilibrium Constants, Redox Potentials, and pHExperiments relating to equilibrium reactions of disulﬁdes with mercaptans
commonly use reaction times of up to 24 h or longer. Although this may seemunrealistic to those in product development, extremely valuable information withpractical implications has been gained from these studies.206 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
The cleavage of the disulﬁde bond in keratin ﬁbers (I) by mercaptans (II) is areversible equilibrium reaction summarized by Equation A, where the K substituentrepresents hair keratin.KAK-S-S-K + 2 R-SH R-S-S-R + 2 K-SH (A)(I)              (II)                           (III)             (IV)This reaction actually proceeds through two steps, each a nucleophilic displace-ment reaction by mercaptide ion on the symmetrical disulﬁde of hair (I in EquationsA and B), and then on the mixed disulﬁde of hair (V in Equation C).KBK-S-S-K  +  R-SH K-S-S-R  +  K-SH (B)(I)KCK-S-S-R  +  R-SH R-S-S-R  +  K-SH (C)(V)In considering these disulﬁde scission reactions, the equilibrium constant of thereaction shown in Equation A tells to what extent the total process will go tocompletion.Equilibrium constant ¼KA¼R-S-S-RðÞ K-SHðÞ2K-S-S-KðÞ R-SHðÞ2Among the ways to determine or approximate the equilibrium constant of thistype of reaction are:
type of reaction are:1. Analysis of ingredient concentrations at equilibrium, and2. From redox potentials [ 5,6].In either case, one may use cystine as a model for hair, since the literature [ 5–7]shows that the redox potential of “cystine-type” disulﬁdes is virtually independentof the charge group about the disulﬁde bond. However, reduction potentials ofmercaptans do vary with pH [ 6]. Therefore, equilibrium constants for thesereactions will also vary with pH. Patterson et al. [ 8] have shown that when woolﬁber is reacted with 0.2 M thioglycolic acid solution for 20 h the extent of reductionincreases with increasing pH above 6. Assuming equilibrium, this suggests that thedifference in redox potential between thioglycolic acid and cysteine in keratin ﬁbersincreases with increasing pH above 6, and the equilibrium constant for this reactionincreases similarly.One may approximate the free energies and equilibrium constants of thesereactions from these expressions:DF

The number of electrons transferred during the reaction (2) is designated by n; fis Faraday’s constant (23,061 calories per volt equivalent); Eois the difference instandard redox potentials of the two mercaptans in volts; Fois the standard freeenergy; R is the gas constant (1.987 calories per degree mole); and T the absolutetemperature (/C14K). These calculations assume standard conditions; i.e., products andreactants are at unit activity.4.2.2 Equilibrium Constants and Chemical StructureEquilibrium constants at pH 7 or lower, for the reduction of cystine by simplemercaptans such as cysteine (VI), thioglycolic acid (VII), or even more complexmercaptans such as glutathione (VIII), are all approximately 1 [ 5,6].NH2-CH-CH2-SH HO2C-CH2-SH NH-CH2-CO2HCO2H Thioglycolic C=OCysteine (VI) acid   (VII) H-C-CH2-SHN-HO=C-CH2-CH2-CH-CO2HNH2Glutathione   (VIII)Fruton and Clark [5] have shown that the redox potentials of other cysteine-
type mercaptans are very similar at pH 7.15. However, Cleland [ 5] has shownthat dithiothreitol (IX) and its isomer, dithioerythritol, have much lower redoxpotentials than cysteine at neutral pH.S-HH-C-H H-C            SCH-OH O2 CH-OHCH-OH CH-OHH-C-H H-CHHSS-HDithiothreitol (IX) (X)Weigmann and Rebenfeld [ 9] have reacted IX with wool ﬁber, showing thatcomplete reduction of cystinyl residues can be approached at pH 6 to 6.5 using onlya fourfold excess of IX to keratin disulﬁde. Cleland suggests that the equilibriumconstant KBin Equation B (of dithiothreitol and cystine) should be close to l.208 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
However, the cyclization of IX to a stable six membered ring disulﬁde (X), duringthe reaction described in Equation C, provides an equilibrium constant of the orderof 104¼KC, and therefore K B/C2KC¼KAis of the order of 104.Wickett and Barman [ 10–12] have expanded this area of research througha series of studies that involve reduction of hair ﬁbers under stress using,dihydrolipoic acid (XI), and 1,3-dithiopropanol (XII) which are analogs ofdithiothreitol. This study demonstrated that monothio analogs of dihydrolipoicacid reduce hair at a slower rate than the corresponding dithio compounds. Thiscorrelates with the higher equilibrium constant of reaction of dihydrolipoic acid vs.cysteine. The dithio compounds can cyclize to form stable ﬁve-membered ringdisulﬁde structures during reduction (analogous to dithiothreitol), but the monothiocompounds cannot. This conﬁrms that cyclization to stable ring structures during
the reduction step can be an important driving force in this reaction.CH2-SH CH2-SHCH2 CH2CH-SH CH2-SHCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO2HDihydrolipoic acid (XI) 1,3 Dithiopropanol (XII)Wickett and Barman have further demonstrated that these ﬁve- and six-memberedring-forming reducing agents penetrate into hair via a moving boundary. Thissuggests nearly complete reduction as the thiol penetrates into the hair. Wickettand Barman have also demonstrated that thioglycolic acid below pH 9 does notexhibit moving boundary kinetics, but above pH 10 it does (see the section onkinetics in this Chapter). These scientists also studied structure-activityrelationships of a variety of analogs of these three cyclizing dithiols illustratingthe effects of hydroxyl groups and alkyl chain groupings on the rate of this reaction.One purpose of these studies was to try to achieve essentially complete
reduction of a smaller cross section of the ﬁber to determine if effective permanent-waving could still be achieved. A potential advantage to this type of process isto lessen cortical reduction and thereby to lessen cortical damage to the hair (theregion primarily responsible for tensile properties) during the permanent-waveprocess.Complete reduction in the annulus or outer regions of the hair does not occurwith thioglycolic acid in current home permanent-wave products. To achieve apermanent wave, thioglycolic acid provides more diffuse reduction over a greaterarea of the ﬁber cross section [ 11]. This concept and its execution provide some
interesting implications to the mechanism of permanent waving, suggesting thatpermanent set retention is not governed solely by the cortex and cannot beexplained by considering only matrix reduction and consequent matrix-microﬁbril(matrix-intermediate ﬁlament) interactions. Moreover, strong cuticle interactionsinvolving reduction and reshaping of the exocuticle and its A layer are probablyrelevant to permanent waving, and these cuticle changes should be considered in4.2 Reduction of the Disulﬁde Bond 209
any explanation of the permanent-wave process, as suggested and demonstrated byWortmann and Kure [ 1,2].These ring-forming reduc ing agents have never been successfully introducedinto the marketplace, primarily because they are sensitizing agents. Anotherpossible concern must be greater cuticle damage by this type of action. It isconceivable that the effects of these exte nsive cuticle changes (essentially com-plete reduction of disulﬁde bonds in the exocuticle and A layer) on other hairproperties and on long-term damaging effe cts from normal grooming operationscould be prohibitive.Further consideration of this two-step equilibrium process (Equations B and C)suggests the possibility for approaching complete ﬁssion of keratin cystinylresidues while producing only about 50% of the possible cysteinyl residues throughformation of an extremely stable mixed disulﬁde (V). This type of reaction could bedescribed as one with an extremely high KBand a K Cof much less than 1. Haefele
Band a K Cof much less than 1. Haefeleand Broge [ 13] have suggested that thioglycolamide (XIII) is such a mercaptan, onthe basis of its ability to produce excellent waving characteristics in addition toexcellent wet strength. No further supporting evidence has been offered to conﬁrmthis conclusion.NH2-CO-CH2-SHThioglycolamide (XIII)4.2.3 Equilibrium and Removal of One of the Reaction ProductsO’Donnell [ 14] has shown that wool ﬁber, when reacted with thoglycolic acid at pH5.6 approaches complete reduction of keratin disulﬁde by removing cysteinylresidues (IV) by means of alkylation followed by re-treatment with thioglycolic acid.4.2.4 Equilibrium and Use of Excess ReactantLeach and O’Donnell [ 15] have shown that the complete reduction of wool ﬁber
with thioglycolic acid can be approached at pH 6.9 by employing extremely largeconcentrations of mercaptan (II) relative to keratin cystine (I). Similar results havebeen reported by Thompson and O’Donnell [ 16] for the reduction of wool ﬁber withmercaptoethanol.210 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
4.2.5 Cystinyl Residues of Different Reactivities in Keratin FibersSince human hair is a complex substrate consisting of different morphologicalregions composed of different proteins (see Chap. 2), ﬁnding different reactivitiesfor the same functional group is not surprising. Evidence for disulﬁde bonds ofdiffering “reactivities” has been described by Middlebrook and Phillips [ 17] and byCarter et al. [ 18]. Different reactivities could be due to varying accessibilities or todifferences in the electronic nature of certain disulﬁde bonds in the ﬁbers resultingfrom differing adjacent amino acids [ 19]. This latter suggestion, based on work withpure disulﬁdes and not with ﬁbers, is contrary to the ﬁndings of Fruton and Clark [ 6]and to the opinion of this author. Differences are more likely to occur in reactionrate from differing accessibilities but not differences in the true equilibrium natureof the keratin disulﬁde reduction reaction from inductive effects.
The variation of equilibrium constant with structure, as a function of pH, has notbeen thoroughly explored. However, discussion of the behavior of keratin cystine inthe presence of thioglycolic acid at different pH’s is described in the ﬁrst section ofthis Chapter.Since this reduction process is a reversible equilibrium reaction, removal of oneof the products of reaction (either III or IV), or use of higher concentrations ofmercaptan (II) than disulﬁde (I), should drive the reaction to completion. Both ofthese principles have been conﬁrmed.4.3 Kinetics of the ReductionAll cleavages of simple disulﬁdes by mercaptans that have been studied kineti-cally are bimolecular ionic reactions of t he SN 2 type, involving direct displace-ment by mercaptide ion on disulﬁde as described by Foss [ 20] and most OrganicChemistry textbooks. Since the active speci es in this disulﬁde scission process isthe mercaptide ion [ 21] rather than the unionized mercaptan, pH is a critical
factor. As a consequence, pH can determine the rate-controlling step in thereductive cleavage of cystinyl residue s in keratin ﬁbers by mercaptans. Forexample, in the reaction of wool ﬁbe r with dithiothreitol, Weigmann [ 22]h a sshown that the rate-controlling step at pH 7.0 and above is diffusion of thereducing species into the ﬁbers. However, at acidic pH (3.5), the chemicalreaction itself appears to be rate-lim iting. A similar change in mechanism withpH has been suggested by Kubu and Montgomery [ 23] for the reduction of woolﬁber by cysteine and also for the reduction of human hair by several thiols,including thioglycolic acid [ 24].Wickett [ 10] has shown that for the reaction of sodium thioglycolate with one lotof hair, at pH 9 or below, the rate of the reaction followed pseudo-ﬁrst-orderkinetics and therefore was reaction-controlled. However, at pH 10 and above,4.3 Kinetics of the Reduction 211
moving boundary kinetics or diffusion of mercaptan into the hair controlled thereaction rate. Wickett further demonstrated under conditions closer to those ofactual permanent waving (pH 9.5 and 0.6 M sodium thioglycolate) that for hairfrom one individual who exhibited high reactivity, the reaction rate followedpseudo ﬁrst order kinetics. For hair from another individual, which was more difﬁcultto wave, diffusion of the reducing agent into the hair was the rate-determining step.Thus for difﬁcult-to-wave hair, the rate of the reaction of thioglycolate waves isgoverned by diffusion of the reducing agent into the hair.In other words, for difﬁcult-to-wave hair or at high pH, the concentration ofmercaptide ion is so high that cleavage of the disulﬁde bond can occur faster thanmercaptide can diffuse into the ﬁbers. As the pH is decreased to the acid side, or foreasy-to-wave hair, the rate of chemical reaction decreases faster than diffusion to
the point at which the chemical reaction itself becomes rate limiting. With manymercaptans [ 21], further lowering of the pH to about two freezes or stops thereduction reaction.Evans et al. [ 25] have conﬁrmed these conclusions of Wickett. In addition, theobservation that Japanese hair is “easy to perm” and that ﬁne Caucasian hair, lessthan 75 mm in diameter, is more “difﬁcult to p erm” was also conﬁrmed. However,these scientists were unable to identif y any common characteristics such as ﬁberdiameter or cystine content that would account for this behavior. The fact that ﬁnehair is more difﬁcult to perm than thick hair may be due to the larger ratio ofcuticle to cortex in ﬁne hair and the fact that cortex plays a stronger role in wavingthan cuticle. This explanation is consi stent with the experiments by Wortmannand Kure [ 2] demonstrating that the cuticle does i nhibit the reduction reaction. Inaddition to pH, other important variable s that inﬂuence the rate of reduction of
keratin ﬁbers by mercaptans are temperatu re, hair swelling, prior history of thehair, and structure of the mercaptan. These factors are described in the nextsection of this Chapter.4.3.1 Factors Affecting the Rate of the Reduction ReactionSince the rate-controlling step in this reaction can be diffusion of the reducing agentinto the ﬁbers or the chemical reaction itself, it is important to consider the rate interms of these two potentially rate limiting factors.The pH region most commonly employed for the reduction of hair ﬁbers bymercaptans is above neutral (generally 9–9.5). In the professional ﬁeld, glyceryl-monothioglycolate (GMT) was introduced in Europe in the 1960s and into the U.S.in the 1970s [ 24,26]. This thiol is the active ingredient used in several commercialacid waves where the waving solution has a pH near 7. It would appear that thereaction of GMT with hair is a reaction-controlled rate process, since the pH of the
system is near 7.212 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
CH2-OHCH-OHCH2-O-CO-CH2-SH HS-CH2-CH2-NH2* HClGlycerylmonothioglycolate (GMT)    Cysteamine HydrochlorideThe processing time for a GMT permanent is about twice as long as for aconventional thioglycolate wave and it requires a covering cap and the heat of adryer to enhance the rate of reduction. Wickett [ 10] has shown that for sodiumthioglycolate under conditions where reaction rate control exists, the activationenergy is lower than for diffusion rate control. Therefore, under these conditions anincrease in temperature will have less of an effect on the reaction rate than if thereaction were a diffusion-controlled process. The acid wave supporters claimsuperiority due to reduced swelling and less damage; however, no data could befound to support these claims. To date, GMT acid waves have been used only byprofessionals and not in the retail ﬁeld [ 26].Cysteamine hydrochloride is another active thiol used in professional products at
a lower pH about 8.3. Manuszak et al. [ 27] have compared the reduction of hair bycysteamine and thioglycolic acid. At a pH where similar concentrations ofmercaptide ion were present, thioglycolic acid was more effective in reducing theﬁbers. One explanation is that cysteamine forms an internal ﬁve membered ringstructure via internal hydrogen bonding from the protonated amine group to themercaptide group, thereby reducing its availability for reaction.4.3.2 Effect of Temperature on the Reaction RateThe activation energy for the reduction of either human hair or wool ﬁber atalkaline pH is of the order of 12–28 kcal per degree mole [ 10,22,24]. Wickett[10] explains that when the mechanism is diffusion-rate-controlled, the activationenergy is higher (28.0 kcal per degree mole) [ 10], because the boundary movement
depends on both reaction and diffusion. However, when the rate depends only onthe chemical reaction, the activation energy is lower (about 19.7 kcal per degreemole). Therefore, reaction rates for both of these systems are only moderatelyaffected by increases in temperature. The activation energy for the chemicalreaction at acid pH is slightly lower [ 22]. Therefore, the rate of reaction underacid conditions should be affected less by changes in temperature.Japanese hair straightening a process that involves reducing the hair and thenapplying a hot straightening iron to it to achieve a permanent straightening hairtreatment will be described later in this Chapter in Sect. 4.12.4.3 Kinetics of the Reduction 213
4.3.3 Effect of Hair Swelling and Hair Conditionon the Reaction RateAbove the isoelectric point, the swelling of hair increases substantially withincreasing pH [ 28,29] (also see Chap. 9). Herrmann [ 24] has shown a cor-responding increase in the rate of diffusion of mercaptans into hair ﬁbers withincreasing pH. Hydrogen bond breaking agents (hair swelling agents), namely ureaand other amides, have been added to depilatory formulations for the purpose ofenhancing the rate of reduction [ 24,29]. Heilingotter [ 30] has shown that theaddition of urea to thioglycolic acid solution increases the rate of swelling of theﬁbers. Depilatory systems are generally high-pH mercaptan systems (pH 11 to 12)where moving boundary kinetics exists under all conditions [ 10], and a commondepilatory ingredient is calcium thioglycolate (see Fig. 4.1and the section on
depilatories in this Chapter). Note the axial folds created by the extreme swellingand then rapid dehydration on drying. These folds are created because of thedifferential shrinkage in the different cuticle layers due to extensive bond breakingand the leaching out of solubilized proteinaceous matter.Undoubtedly, the condition of the hair also plays a role in the rate of reduction,especially under conditions where diffusion is rate-limiting. Permanent-waving[31] and bleaching [ 32] produce alterations to hair that result in increased swellingin solvents. Also, hair that has been previously bleached or permanent-waveddisplays more rapid rates of reduction than chemically unaltered ﬁbers. As a con-sequence, weaker reducing systems are offered in the marketplace to permanent-waveFig. 4.1 Hair ﬁber aftertreatment with calciumthioglycolate (depilatory)214 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
hair that has been previously damaged by bleaches and other damaging chemicaltreatments.Figures 4.2and4.3illustrate the large amount of damage inﬂicted on hair ﬁbersby combined oxidation and reduction treatments. These ﬁbers were oxidized withalkaline peroxide and then reduced and extended to fracture in the dry state. All ofthe ﬁbers treated in this manner broke between only 10% and 20% extension asopposed to ﬁbers that had been only reduced. The reduced ﬁbers broke at asigniﬁcantly higher extension. Figure 4.2illustrates the large number of deep cracksin the cuticle perpendicular to the ﬁber axis that extend through all the cuticlelayers. The SEM of Fig. 4.3was taken at the fracture site itself and shows multiplestep fractures and even torn cuticle and cortical cells resulting from extensivedamage to the proteins of the cell membrane complex and to proteins in bothcuticle and cortical cells. Although these treatments are stronger than generally
used in practice, they illustrate the greater sensitivity of bleached hair to reductivetreatments and also just how degrading combined bleaching and permanent wavingcan be.An initiation time for the reduction reaction was found by Weigmann [ 22] in hiskinetic study of the reduction of wool ﬁber. Weigmann attributed the initiation timeFig. 4.2 Hair ﬁber oxidizedwith peroxide, reduced withthioglycolate and extended tofracture dry. Bottom : At lowmagniﬁcation, note the cracksperpendicular to the ﬁberaxis. Top: Highermagniﬁcation shows cracksare through the entire cuticle(SEM kindly provided bySigrid Ruetsch)4.3 Kinetics of the Reduction 215
to the epicuticle the initial barrier to reduction that is eliminated after a shortreduction time. It is likely that the initial reduction reaction cleaves some thioesterlinkages removing some 18-methyl eicosanoic acid from the surface but it wouldappear that the major breakdown in the cell membranes by permanent wavesinvolves the cleavage of disulﬁde bonds by the thiol active in the permanentwave which weakens the membranes and leaves a high concentration of mercaptangroups to allow further membrane degradation under stress and in that manner thediffusion barrier of the hair surface is degraded. As a consequence, hair thathas been permanent-waved or has undergone alterations to its outer layers shouldprovide less or no initiation time in subsequent reductions or reactions.Diffusion rates are signiﬁcantly greater in wool ﬁber than in human hair [ 33].This effect is due to the lower disulﬁde content of wool ﬁber relative to human hair.
Therefore, one might anticipate a more rapid rate of reduction for wool ﬁber thanfor human hair, under conditions of diffusion-controlled reduction.Scale lifting by alternating treatments of certain anionic and cationic surfactantscan occur on hair previously permanent waved or extensively bleached, seeFigs. 4.4and4.5. Furthermore, hair purchased from consumers who had beengiven a home or salon permanent wave on the head shows an even greaterpropensity for this type of scale damage than hair permed in the laboratory. Webelieve that this phenomenon involves scale lifting through a weakened cellmembrane complex. Figure 4.6depicts the damaging effects of reductive treat-
ments on the cell membrane complex. This ﬁber was reduced and not re-oxidizedchemically and then extended to break. Note the large gaps between cuticle cellsand at the cuticle-cortex junction created by the weakened cell membrane complex.Such gaps do not occur in the cell membrane complex by extending chemicallyunaltered hair to break. This reaction likely involves cleavage of thioester in thesurface and in each layer between cuticle cells by thiolate of the TGA becauseFig. 4.3 Fiber was oxidized, reduced and extended to break dry. This SEM was taken at thefracture site. Note the multiple step fractures in the cell membrane complex (SEM kindly providedby Sigrid Ruetsch)216 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
Fig. 4.4 Fiber was permanent waved on the head, after a few weeks cut, and treated with threealternating treatments of TEA lauryl sulfate and stearalkonium chloride and observed in the lightmicroscope. Note the lifted cuticle scalesFig. 4.5 Similar treatment asin Fig. 4.4, except this ﬁberwas observed in the dry stateby SEM.

Notethe lifting of scales due to theweakened cell membranecomplex4.3 Kinetics of the Reduction 217
thioester is sensitive to nucleophiles and the thiol grouping is one of the mostpowerful nucleophiles in organic chemistry.The scale lifting phenomenon described above is due primarily to the penetra-tion of cationic and anionic surfactant into the endocuticle and the cell membranecomplex and the subsequent deposition and build-up of a hydrophobic anionic-cationic complex layer. When this layer is sufﬁciently large, a lifting action iscreated by the differential swelling action in the cuticle layers. This effect is
analogous to the bending action of a laminar thermostat to heat changes. The factthat hair permed on heads is more reactive to this scale lifting phenomenon suggestsgreater cell membrane complex damage on live heads compared to laboratorywaving. I believe this effect is due to weathering exposures on permanent wavedhair such as “fatiguing like actions” during grooming that result primarily fromcombing and brushing actions or other damaging exposures such as UV radiation.This scale lifting phenomenon could provide a simple test to detect and deﬁne theextent of damage to the cell membrane complex. For a more complete descriptionof this scale lifting phenomenon, see Chap. 6.Figure 4.7also represents hair ﬁbers reduced and then extended to fracture and
shows effects occurring deeper inside the ﬁber. The fracturing of this ﬁber clearlyshows that reductive treatments do weaken the cell membrane complex extendingacross the entire ﬁber even into the medulla. This electron micrograph provides aninteresting view of the structure of the medulla conﬁrming that it consists of hollowspheres rather than simply a porous region of the ﬁber.Fig. 4.6 Fiber reduced with TGA at pH 10 and extended to break dry. Note the cracks between thescales caused by a weakened CMC (SEM kindly provided by Sigrid Ruetsch)218 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
4.3.4 Effect of Mercaptan Structure on the Reaction Rate4.3.4.1 Electrostatic EffectsHerrmann [ 24] described a minimum at acid pH for the diffusion of a cationiccontaining thiol (thioglycolhydrazide) into human hair. He also examined theinﬂuence of pH on theHS-CH2-CO-NH-NH2Thioglycolhydraziderate of diffusion of thio acids (thioglycolic and thiolactic acids) into human hair. Forthis latter type of mercaptan, the minimum in diffusion rate occurs near neutral pH.These thio acids are of anionic character in alkaline media, and they diffuse faster inalkaline than in acidic media. Therefore, hair swelling must play a more importantrole than electrostatics for the diffusion of these simple mercaptans into human hair.4.3.4.2 Nucleophilicity of the Mercapto GroupThe nucleophilicity of the mercaptan grouping depends on the nature of the groups
directly attached or in close proximity to the mercaptan functional group.In general, nucleophilicity increases with increasing basicity of the mercaptanfunction [ 34]. Over the range of conditions where diffusion is rate-limiting,changes to the nucleophilicity of the mercapto group will have little effect on therate of reduction. However, where the chemical reaction is rate-controlling, theFig. 4.7 Fiber reduced and extended to fracture dry. The medullary cracks show that reductivetreatments weaken the intercellular structures of the entire ﬁber, even in the medulla (SEM kindlyprovided by Sigrid Ruetsch)4.3 Kinetics of the Reduction 219
nucleophilicity of the mercapto group will be of greater importance. Theoretically,in a diffusion-controlled reduction, one could increase the rate of reduction bysacriﬁcing nucleophilicity (decrease the basicity of the mercaptide ion) in order toincrease diffusibility.Haefele and Broge [ 35] have reported the mercapto acidities for a large numberof mercaptans (pK RSH 4.3 to 10.2); thioglycolic acid is just above 10 (10.4).Hydrogen sulﬁde, the simplest mercaptan, has a pK RSH of 7.0 [ 35]. As one mightpredict, the substitution of electron-withdrawing groups (carbonyl, alkyl ester, alkylamide) for a hydrogen atom increases the mercapto acidity. Electron- donatinggroups (carboxy, alkyl) decrease mercaptan acidity.Under conditions of lower pH, where this reduction process is reaction-controlledrather than diffusion-controlled, Equation B or C can be rate-limiting. If Equation B
is rate-limiting, the reaction is simply second order—ﬁrst-order with respect tomercaptan and ﬁrst-order with respect to keratin disulﬁde—and analysis is not ascomplicated as when Equation C is rate-limiting. In kinetic studies for a complexmaterial like human hair or wool ﬁber, an excess of thiol is most commonlyemployed, and one generally assumes the reaction in Equation B to be rate-controlling. The reaction is then described by pseudo-ﬁrst-order kinetics (ﬁrst-order with respect to keratin disulﬁde).4.3.4.3 Steric EffectsThe rate of diffusion of mercaptans into human hair is undoubtedly inﬂuenced by
steric considerations. For example, molecular size (effective minimum moleculardiameter) of the mercaptan molecule should affect the rate of diffusion into hair.Therefore, the rate of reduction of human hair by ethyl mercaptan in neutral toalkaline media, where diffusion is rate-determining, should be faster than thatof higher homologs. (The possible effects produced by varying the structure ofcystinyl residues in hair on the rate of reduction were considered in the previoussection on cystinyl residues of differing reactivities.)4.3.4.4 Counterion EffectsAmmonia or alkanolamines such as monoethanol amine are the primary neutra-lizing bases for reducing solutions of thioglycolate permanent waves. Ammonia issaid to facilitate diffusion of thioglycolate through hair as compared to sodiumhydroxide [ 36].Heilingotter [ 37,38] has compared a large number of neutralizing bases includ-
ing ammonia, monoethanol amine, sodium hydroxide, isopropanol amine, ethylenediamine, diethanol amine, and triethanol amine with regard to the ability of thecorresponding salts of thioglycolic acid to decrease the 20% index (at a pH close to 9.2).This criterion was used to assess the ability of these different thioglycolatesto function as permanent-wave reducing agents. He found that ammonia and220 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
monoethanol amine provide the maximum effects. Furthermore, the reducing powerof triethanolamine thioglycolate is so weak as to render it ineffective as a permanent-waving agent.Heilingotter suggested that of the two most effective reducing systems, ammo-nium thioglycolate provides the more satisfactory waving characteristics. It wouldappear that this “catalytic activity” of nitrogen-containing bases is due to theirability to swell the hair, thus allowing faster diffusion of mercaptan into the interiorof the ﬁber.Other salts of thioglycolic acid have been described as potential permanent-waving agents, including potassium [ 39], magnesium [ 40] and of course esters suchas glycerol monothioglycolate and other esters [ 41]. Magnesium thioglycolate hasbeen described as an odorless permanent wave agent, although this system hasnever achieved commercial success.4.3.4.5 Side Reactions During the Reduction of Keratin Fiberswith Mercaptans
with MercaptansThe reaction of mercaptans with keratin ﬁbers is a relatively speciﬁc reaction inmild acid. However, in alkaline media, peptide bond hydrolysis and the formationof lanthionyl residues can also occur [ 42]. Zahn et al. [ 43] suggested thatmercaptides such as thioglycolate or cysteinate can accelerate the rate of formationof lanthionyl residues in wool ﬁber. (A more detailed discussion of the formation oflanthionyl residues in keratin ﬁbers is described later in this Chapter.)NH2                   NH2CH-CH2-S-CH2-CHCO2H                 CO2HLanthionineHydrolysis of peptide and amide linkages is also a possible complication in analkaline medium. Hydrolysis of the amide groups of the residues of aspartic andglutamic acid amides will increase the ratio of acidic to basic groups in the ﬁbers,conceivably altering the isoelectric and/or isoionic points of the hair.-CO-CH-NH- -CO-CH-NH-CH2 CH2C=O        +    OH- C=O     +     NH3NH2       O -
NH2       O -Hydrolysis of amide of aspartic acid4.3 Kinetics of the Reduction 221
Peptide bonds are the major repeating structural unit of polypeptides andproteins, and they form the structural backbone of human hair. Hydrolysis ofpeptide bonds can also occur at high pH, and both of these reactions (hydrolysisof amide and peptide bonds) are far more prevalent in the action of depilatories,formulated near pH 12, than in permanent waves. Permanent-waving lotions areusually formulated at a pH of approximately 9.2–9.6.RO RO R-C-CH-NH-C-CH-NH-C-CH-NH- OH- -O-C-CH-NH-C-CH-NH-OR O R OR-C-CH-NH2OAlkaline hydrolysis of the peptide bond4.4 Reduction of Hair with Sulﬁte or BisulﬁteSulﬁtes or bisulﬁte (depending on pH) are another important reducing agent forthe disulﬁde bonds in commercial permanent waves. The reaction of sulﬁte withhair involves nucleophilic attack of sulﬁte ion on disulﬁde. This reaction producesone equivalent of mercaptan and one equivalent of Bunte salt [ 44].K-S-S-K  +  M2SO3            K-S-SO3 -M +   +  K-S -M+Bunte salt
Bunte saltReese and Eyring [ 45] demonstrated that the reaction of sulﬁte with hair is apseudo-ﬁrst-order reaction. In other words, the chemical reaction of sulﬁte with thedisulﬁde bond of hair is slower than diffusion of sulﬁte into hair. Elsworth andPhillips [ 46,47] and Volk [ 48] examined the sulﬁtolysis of keratin, demonstratingthat the rate of cystine cleavage is optimal at acid pH. Wolfram and Underwood[49] found a broad optimum for cystine cleavage by sulﬁte at pH 4–6. The decreasein cystine cleavage at acidic pH (below pH 4) is due to a decrease in the concentra-tion of the nucleophilic sulﬁte species. On the other hand, the decrease in cystinecleavage as pH is raised (alkaline pH) results from alkaline hydrolysis of the Buntesalt [ 50].The patent literature teaches that rebuilding disulﬁde bonds in keratin aftersulﬁtolysis may be accomplished through water rinsing. However, reversal ofsulﬁtolysis by rinsing is normally slow and inefﬁcient [ 26]. In addition, Bunte
salt is resistant to oxidizing agents. Therefore, neutralizers such as bromate orhydrogen peroxide are not totally efﬁcient in rebuilding disulﬁde bonds in sulﬁtewaves.Sneath [ 51] showed that the bisulﬁte waving treatment decreases the barrierfunction of the cell membrane complex as evidenced by cationic dye absorption,222 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
however, part of this reaction is reversible, and therefore, probably involves theBunte salt groupings. In addition, lipids (including 18-methyl eicosanoic acid) areremoved from the cell membrane complex during bisulﬁte waving and this part ofthe reaction is not reversible and a higher concentration of mercaptan and oxidizedsulfur are left in the hair to weaken it.To summarize and to compare the two processes of thioglycolate and sulﬁtereduction of hair, we ﬁnd that the thiol (or nucleophile) reacts with hair, producingcysteine residues in the following manner:K-S-S-K  +  2  R-SH            2  K-SH  +  R-S-S- RThis reaction can be largely but not completely reversed by rinsing and oxidationin air. However, the most effective reversal is achieved through mild chemicaloxidants.On the other hand, sulﬁte reacts with the disulﬁde bonds in hair to producemercaptan and Bunte salt:K-S-S-K  +  SO3- K-S-+    K-S-SO3-Bunte sal t
K-S-S-K  +  SO3- K-S-+    K-S-SO3-Bunte sal tRinsing of the sulﬁte-treated hair slow ly reverses the reaction, rebuildingcystine bonds. The rate of cystine reformation increases with increasing pH, andgood set stability is achieved at pH 8 o r higher. Because of the efﬁciency ofreversal of the sulﬁtolysis reactio n with alkali, Albrecht and Wolfram [ 52]suggest that for low cleavage levels, sulﬁte is a more eff ective setting agentthan thioglycolate. However, at higher cl eavage levels, thioglycolate is the supe-rior active ingredient.In addition, thioglycolate at alkaline pH is more effective at higher cleavagelevels, because thioglycolate is a stronger reducing agent than sulﬁte. Its greatereffectiveness is borne out by the fact that under optimum conditions, for difﬁcult-to-wave hair, the rate-controlling step for the thioglycolate reaction is diffusion ofthe reducing species into the ﬁbers [ 10]. On the other hand, for sulﬁte at its optimum
(acid pH), the rate-determining step is chemical reaction with the disulﬁde bond.4.5 Summary of Chemical Changes to Hairby Permanent WavingAs hair is exposed to permanent waving, changes take place in the surface layers,the cell membrane complex, the A-Layer and exocuticle in addition to the cortexleading to the formation of increasing concentrations of these sulfur compounds,mercaptan, sulﬁnate and sulfonate groups and a decrease in the free lipid content inthe surface layers. Zahn et al. [ 53] have shown an increase in the thiol content of4.5 Summary of Chemical Changes to Hair by Permanent Waving 223
whole ﬁber from about 11 mmol/g in untreated hair to as high as 94 mmol/g forpermanent waved hair and Robbins and Kelly [ 54] has shown similar amounts ofcysteic acid in permanent waved hair actually waved on people’s heads(49–94 mmol/g) vs. about 25 mmol/g for controls. Since a normal permanent waveusually reduces less than 50% of the whole ﬁber in cross-section these values arelikely to be much higher in the outer layers of the ﬁber.Kon et al. [ 55] examined Japanese hair permanent waved on live heads every2–3 months comparing it to untreated controls. These scientists analyzed two typesof permanent waved hair: Permed hair with many splits and permed hair withseveral broken hairs and a few split ends. This latter hair, by SEM analysis, showedconsiderably less cuticle most likely from abrasive actions such as combing andbrushing. From analysis of 18-methyl eicosanoic acid and isopeptide (cuticleanalyses) the following results were revealed, see Table 4.1.
The data of Table 4.1were calculated from the results by Kon et al. [ 55] andshow very little change in MEA from the control to the permed hair in the mid-sections compared with the tip ends. Because the thiol will not attack the isopeptidelinkage and considering the fact that such large changes occur in the isopeptidecontent of the permed hair, these large changes suggest that greater effects areproduced in this hair by abrasive actions which remove cuticle proteins and lipidsthan by direct chemical action of the thiol. Therefore the chemical and physicalchanges from permanent waving have a profound effect on reducing the abrasionresistance of hair.With regard to effects on the cortex, Kon et al. [ 55] found that permanent waving
produced a signiﬁcant decrease in microﬁbril protein and an increase in highmolecular weight protein which showed up most readily in the tip ends of thehair. This increase in high molecular weight protein probably results from adisulﬁde-mercaptan interchange reaction.With regard to the changes most relevant to shampoos and hair conditioners,these reactions of permanent waving, convert the virgin hair surface from ahydrophobic, entity with little surface charge to a more hydrophilic, more polarand more negatively charged surface. More of the lower oxidation state sulfurcompounds are formed in permanent waved hair and exist after waving as com-pared to chemically bleached hair or sunlight oxidized hair.

curvature changes produce higher rubbing forces resulting in more cuticle proteinand lipid removal by hair grooming actions.4.6 Reduction of Keratin Fibers with Other ReagentsIn addition to mercaptans and sulﬁtes, ingredients that have been used for nucleo-philic cleavage of the disulﬁde bond in hair and/or wool ﬁber are sulﬁdes, hydrox-ide, water (steam), a phosphine, borohydride, dithionite (hydrosulﬁte), andsulfoxylate. The interactions of some of these compounds with the disulﬁde bondin hair are described below.4.6.1 SulﬁdesSalts of hydrogen sulﬁde are extremely potent reducing agents for hair and havebeen used in depilatory compositions [ 56]. In a sense, salts of hydrogen sulﬁde are
the simplest and among the most diffusible of all mercaptans. The initial reactionwith the disulﬁde bond in keratin ﬁbers is described by Equation D. Obviously,compound XIV can also ionize and react with cystinyl residues, forming organicpolysulﬁdes. Compound XIV can even react with hydrogen sulﬁde (anion) to forminorganic polysulﬁde.K-S-S-K  +  M+-S-H               K-S-SH  +  K-S-+M                      (D)(XIV)4.6.2 Steam and/or AlkaliSetting of wool and hair by either steam or hot alkaline solutions is a very oldprocess [ 57]. Steam is also very effective for producing a permanent set. Alkali andsteam are known to cleave the disulﬁde bond in keratins [ 58–60] and alkaline
treatments are known to be the most effective hair straightening compositionsbecause they provide the most permanent set (see the section on hair straighteningin this Chapter). The reaction with hydroxide is summarized below by Equation E.Since sulfenic acids are generally unstable species [ 61], they have been suggestedas intermediates that can react with the nucleophilic side chains in the keratinmacromolecules [ 59].K-S-S-K  + M+  -O-H                 K-S-OH  +  K-S-M+                     (E)Sulfenic acid4.6 Reduction of Keratin Fibers with Other Reagents 225
As mentioned before, hydrolytic cleavage of peptide bonds in keratins, as well asformation of lanthionyl residues can also occur in alkali. In addition to lanthionine,lysinoalanine [ 62] and Beta-aminoalanine [ 63] residues can be formed in somekeratins under alkaline conditions.C=O                   C=O      C=O                           C=O          C=OCH-CH2-S-CH2-CH        CH-CH2-NH-(CH2)4-CH            CH-CH2-NH2NH                      NH        NH                              NH           NHLanthionyl residue           Lysinoalanine re sidue                  Beta-aminoalanineresidueFormation of lanthionyl residues during alkaline treatment of keratin ﬁberswas ﬁrst suggested by Speakman [ 64] and later demonstrated by Horn et al. [ 65].Lanthionyl residues may be formed from cystinyl residues in proteins underrelatively mild alkaline conditions: 35/C14C and pH 9–14 [ 42]. However, underthese same reaction conditions, lanthionine has not been identiﬁed from free
cystine. For that matter, thioethers have not been formed from organic disulﬁdesother than cystine-containing proteins, using similar reaction conditions [ 66]. At ahigher reaction temperature (reﬂux), Swan [ 67] claims to have identiﬁed smallquantities of lanthionine from reaction of alkali with free cystine.Earland and Raven [ 68] have examined the reaction of N-(mercaptomethyl)polyhexamethyleneadipamide disulﬁde (XV) with alkali. Under alkaline conditionsthat produce lanthionyl residues in wool, no thioether is formed from this polymericdisulﬁde; however, cyanide readily produces thioether from both (XV) and woolﬁber. Therefore, the mechanism for thioether formation must be different in these
two reactions. Since this polymeric disulﬁde (XV) contains no betahydrogen atoms(beta to the disulﬁde group), a likely mechanism for formation of lanthionylresidues in keratins, under alkaline conditions, is the beta-elimination scheme[67] (the reaction depicted by Equation F). Other mechanisms that have beensuggested for this reaction have been summarized by Danehy and Kreuz [ 69].(CH2)4C=O C=O(CH2)4N-CH2-S-S-CH2-N(CH2)6 (CH2)6(XV)The formation of lanthionine in keratin ﬁbers is believed to involve two reactionsequences. The ﬁrst sequence consists of beta-elimination to form dehydroalanineresidues in hair:226 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening

In addition, the dehydroalanine intermediate is a very reactivespecies. It may react with any nucleophilic species present, such as mercaptanor amine, including mercaptan or amine residues on the hair or such groups insolution, to form lanthionine (other thioethers), or lysinoalanine [ 66,70,71], orbeta-aminoalanine residues [ 63,70–72] as shown below.Cystineor mercaptanNH NHNHC=CH2DehydroalanineIntermediateNH NHNH3C=OCH-CH2-NH2Beta-aminoalanineresidueNHCH-CH2-S-CH2-CH Lanthionyl residueor thioetherC=O C=OC=OLysine C=O C=OCH-CH2-NH-(CH2)4-CH Lysinoalanineresidue

For wool ﬁber, all three residues-lanthionine, lysinoalanine, and beta-aminoalaninehave been shown to form from reactions under alkaline conditions [ 70,72,73]. In thecase of human hair, only lanthionine and lysinoalanine have been shown to formunder alkaline conditions and lanthionine has been found at more than 100micromoles per gram of hair in hair treated with 0.1 N sodium hydroxide underconditions similar to that of a hair straightener product [ 71], whereas no lanthioninewas found in untreated control hair.4.6.3 AminesThe discussion above on the reaction of alkalinity with wool and hair shows thata very reactive intermediate, dehydroalanine, is formed in hair and wool in thepresence of alkalinity at elevated temperature (30–40/C14C or Chigher). Rivett [ 73]and Tolgyesi and Fang [ 71] have studied the reaction of wool and hair in the
presence of alkaline amine solutions. Under these conditions, one might concludethat if amines are at a sufﬁcient concentration they might add to the dehydroalanineintermediate to form beta-(N-alkylamino) alanine residues.C=O C=OC=CH2 R-NH2 H-C-CH2-NH-RNHDehydroalanine Beta-(N-alkylamino)alanine residueNHSuch is the case. However, the actual products formed depend on the substrate(hair vs. wool), the structure of the amine, its concentration, and the reactiontemperature.With short-chain amines like ethyl or n-butyl amine in the presence of wool ﬁberin alkali, the amounts of lanthionine and lysinoalanine are less (compared to alkalialone), but these two species are still produced in detectable quantities. However,longer-chain amines like pentyl amine react quantitatively with wool ﬁber andvirtually no lanthionine or lysinoalanine is formed.Tolgyesi and Fang [ 71] have found that alkaline amine solutions react differently
with human hair. With human hair, all amines examined, including pentyl amine,compete less effectively with the amino and mercaptan residues of the hair for thedehydroalanine intermediate. As a result, more lanthionine and lysinoalanine crosslinks form than amine adduct, when human hair is the substrate. This is probablybecause diffusion rates are slower into human hair, decreasing the effective con-centration of free amine in the ﬁbers. Therefore, these species cannot compete aseffectively for the dehydroalanine intermediate, and therefore lanthionine andlysinoalanine are formed.228 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
4.6.4 CyanideSalts of hydrogen cyanide have also been found to be capable of nucleophiliccleavage of the disulﬁde bond in keratin ﬁbers [ 74]. In addition, nearly quantitativeconversion of cystinyl residues to lanthionyl residues can be achieved in thisreaction [ 75]. The most plausible mechanism is given in Equations G and H [ 65].This mechanism consists of two nucleophilic displacement reactions: the ﬁrst bycyanide on sulfur, and the second by mercaptide ion on carbon. The mechanismbelow is consistent with the observed formation of thioether from the reaction ofN-(mercaptomethyl)polyhexamethyleneadipamide disulﬁde (XV) with cyanide,but not with alkali [ 68].K-S-S-K   +   M+  -CN K-S-CN   +   M+  -S-KK-S-CN   +   M+  -S-K(G)K-S-K   +   M+  -S-CN (H)4.6.5 A PhosphineTrihydroxymethyl phosphine (THP) or its precursor, tetrahydroxymethyl phospho-nium chloride, has been used to reduce both human hair and wool ﬁber [ 75]. The
mechanism of this reaction was studied by Jenkins and Wolfram [ 76], who discov-ered that this reaction proceeds by nucleophilic attack by the phosphine on sulfur,followed by hydrolysis of the intermediate addition compound to mercaptan andphosphine oxide.+  P-(CH2OH)3K-S-S-K   +   (HO -CH2)3P                    K -S-S-KTHPH2O2 K-SH   +   O=P-(CH2-OH)3Above pH 7, the rate of reaction of THP appears to be controlled by diffusionof the reagent into the ﬁbers [ 75] and, like the reaction of mercaptans withhair, increases rapidly with increasing pH in the vicinity of pH 9 to 12. Presumably,this increase in reaction rate results from increased swelling of the keratin substratewith increasing pH.The equilibrium constant for the reaction of THP with cystyl residues in hairmust be relatively large, since essentially complete reduction of human hair occurswith only a ten-fold excess of THP, at neutral pH [ 77].4.6 Reduction of Keratin Fibers with Other Reagents 229
4.6.6 Miscellaneous Reducing AgentsBorohydride (MBH 4) has also been used as a reducing agent for keratin ﬁbers[78,79], as well as dithionite (M 2S2O4)—sometimes called hydrosulﬁte [ 45].Sulfoxylate (M 2SO2)[80] or, more correctly, its ester salts—e.g., sodium formal-dehyde sulfoxylate (HO-CH 2-SO 2Na) a weak reducing agent is used as a reductivebleach to lighten natural wool and is not an effective permanent waving agent.4.7 Reactions of the Mercaptan GroupThe previous section described various reagents that have been used for thereduction of the disulﬁde bond in keratin ﬁbers. Most of these reactions producecysteinyl residues, or mercaptan groups in the ﬁbers.The mercaptan group is one of the most reactive functional groups in all organicchemistry, and it readily undergoes oxidation, nucleophilic displacement, nucleo-philic addition, and free-radical addition and displacement reactions. This section
discusses some of the chemical literature pertaining to these types of reaction inreduced keratin ﬁbers, and illustrates the potential reactivity of the mercaptan groupin human hair.4.7.1 Oxidation of Reduced Keratin FibersThe oxidation of the mercaptan group can occur by two distinct pathways—the S-Sﬁssion route (pathway in the presence of most chemical oxidants), and the C-Sﬁssion route, the pathway for radiation-induced cleavage of the disulﬁde bond.Only the S-S ﬁssion route will be discussed in this section, because it is the mostrelevant pathway in relation to permanent waves and reducing agents. For a morecomplete discussion of both of these mechanistic schemes, see Chap. 5.The oxidation of the mercaptan group can occur in several stages:O2 K-SH           K-S-S-K            K-S-S-KMercaptan           Disulfide         Disulfide monoxideO O2 K-SO3HO ODisulfide         Disulfide         Disulfide       Sulfonic acid

Among this group of compounds, mercapta n, disulﬁde, and sulfonic acid havebeen isolated from the oxi dation of reduced hair [ 53], the principle products beingeither disulﬁde or sulfonic acid dependi ng on the strength of the oxidizing agentused. Since the primary intent in the o xidation of reduced hair in permanent-waving is to stop at the disulﬁde stage, mil der oxidizing conditions are used thanfor bleaching hair. Some of the reagents that have been used for oxidation ofreduced hair are bromates [ 81,82,83], iodate [ 85], perborate [ 84], acidic hydro-gen peroxide [ 53], monopersulfate [ 85], and even air oxidation or metal-catalyzedair oxidation [ 79].4.7.2 Nucleophilic DisplacementThe mercaptan group is an extremely powerful nucleophile and it readily undergoesnucleophilic displacement reactions [ 86,87]. This property is the basis of several
quantitative tests for cysteine and/or cystine, including the Sullivan test, whichinvolves nucleophilic displacement by mercaptide ion on iodoacetate [ 88].Methyl iodide has been used as a merca ptan blocking group in studies onkeratin ﬁbers [ 89]. Other monofunctional alkyl ha lides, including benzyl chlo-ride, heptyl bromide, and dodecyl bromi de, have also been reacted with reducedkeratin ﬁbers [ 8]. Hall and Wolfram [ 90] have used this reaction (alkyl iodideswith reduced hair) as a means to introduce alkyl groups or non-polar residuesinto hair. These researchers found that methyl iodide was highly efﬁcient inreacting with the mercaptan groups of re duced hair. Longer chain-length alkyliodides, however, were not nearly as efﬁc ient for introducing alkyl groups intoreduced hair.The Bunte salt grouping has also been reacted with mercaptan in reduced keratinﬁbers [ 91] to form a mixed disulﬁde.Reaction of activated aryl halides, such as 2,4-dinitroﬂuorobenzene, with
cysteine in unreduced and in reduced hair has been described by Zahn [ 53]a saquantitative assay for mercaptan and/or disulﬁde in keratin ﬁbers.4.7 Reactions of the Mercaptan Group 231
FNO2 NO2NO2 NO2K-SH   S-K+ + HFDinitrofluorobenzeneHalo mercury compounds such as methyl mercuric iodide also react readily withmercaptan in keratin ﬁbers [ 92] and serve as the basis of Leach’s method for cystineanalysis.In fact, mercaptan in hair is capable of reacting with disulﬁde monoxide bynucleophilic displacement [ 93] or with most compounds that contain a group labileto nucleophilic displacement, if such labile groups are either formed in the hair orcapable of diffusing into the hair.Molecules containing two leaving groups similar to the previously describedmonofunctional compounds are capable of reacting with reduced keratin ﬁbers andforming a new type of cross-link. Dihaloalkanes have been reacted with reducedwool ﬁber to provide a thioether cross-link [ 8]. This reaction is capable of promot-ing stability to moths in wool [ 94], thus conﬁrming that the primary site that mothsattack in wool ﬁber is the disulﬁde bond.
attack in wool ﬁber is the disulﬁde bond.Di-Bunte salts have also been used to re-cross-link reduced keratin ﬁbersthrough a bis-disulﬁde type of linkage [ 91,93].Other rather exotic bi-functional reagents have been reacted with both reducedand unaltered wool ﬁber and are described in Section C of the Proceedings of theInternational Wool Textile Research Conference (1955).232 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
4.7.3 Treatment of Reduced Hair with Dithioglycolate EsterDerivatives of PolyoxyethyleneA novel treatment in permanent waving involves reacting reduced hair withpolyoxyethylene esters of thioglycolic acid (mol. wt. 550–750) described bySalce et al. [ 95]. These esters are reported to bind to the ﬁbers by displacement ofreduced disulﬁde in hair on the ester linkage of the additive resulting in the for-mation of mixed disulﬁdes, producing more hydrophobic hair ﬁbers and improve-ment in the curl relaxation due to the increased hydrophobicity.4.7.4 Nucleophilic Addition ReactionsMercaptan groups in keratin ﬁbers also undergo nucleophilic addition reactionswith active oleﬁns (oleﬁns containing a strong electron-withdrawing group attachedto the double bond). Schoberl [ 93] has shown that reduced wool ﬁber reacts withvinyl sulfones.Maleimides are another example of activated oleﬁns that react in this manner—
e.g., N-ethyl maleimide (NEMI) [ 93,96] reacts quantitatively with the mercaptangroups in reduced keratin ﬁbers by a nucleophilic addition type reaction. Halland Wolfram [ 90] have used this reaction to introduce N-substituted maleimidegroups (N-ethyl, N-hexyl, and N-heptyl maleimides) into human hair to study theproperties of hair modiﬁed by the introduction of non-polar residues. They reportenhanced settability and high set retention, at all humidities, for hair modiﬁed inthis manner with greater than 50% disulﬁde cleavage. However, hair having lessthan 50% disulﬁde scission does not show improved set characteristics.N O O N O OR RKS HKSH +N-substituted maleimideAcrylonitrile and phenyl acrylate have also been shown to react readily with themercaptan groups of reduced hair [ 96].4.7 Reactions of the Mercaptan Group 233
Bi-functional reagents containing two active vinyl groups are capable of reactingwith reduced keratin ﬁbers and forming cross-links. Divinyl sulfone has beenused for this purpose [ 93].4.7.5 Free-Radical Addition and Polymerization ReactionsOne form of polymerization that has been used in the chemistry of wool ﬁberinvolves reduction of the ﬁbers followed by the addition of a vinyl monomer and anoxidizing agent [ 97,98]. These reactions have been carried out in an inert atmo-sphere and provide rather large polymer add-ons. Related procedures have alsobeen described for polymerizing into human hair in an air atmosphere and aredescribed in detail in Chap. 8[99–101].In this type of reaction, the mercaptan group of the reduced keratin may serve as
the reducing agent in a redox system for generating free radicals. The mercaptangroup may also serve as a site for grafting, and it can serve as a chain transfer agent,limiting the degree of polymerization. Another advantage to this system is theincreased swelling of the ﬁbers accompanying reduction. This effect facilitatesdiffusion of all reagents necessary to polymerization into the ﬁbers. (For additionaldetails, see Chap. 8.)Polymerization into wool ﬁber has also been accomplished using radiationgrafting techniques [ 102,103], although no such procedures could be found usinghuman hair as substrate.4.8 Water Setting Human HairIf human hair is wet with water and held in a given conﬁguration while drying,it will tend to remain in that conﬁguration. This is the basis of what is called awater-set in human hair. It is well known; however, that exposure of water set hairto high humidity produces a loss of set. Recently, Diaz and co-workers [ 104] have
demonstrated that exposure of water-set hair tresses to a lower humidity can also234 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
produce a loss of set. In addition, Robbins and Reich [ 105] have demonstrated thissame phenomenon with single hair ﬁbers.Table 4.2summarizes one of the single-ﬁber experiments. Single hairs werewater-set in a curled conﬁguration on glass rods and dried at 60% RH. Afterremoving the ﬁbers from the rods, one group of hairs was exposed to a 60% RHatmosphere and another to 10% RH. Curl length was measured over time with acathetometer.The data in Table 4.2were then analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. Highlysigniﬁcant time effects, signiﬁcant humidity effects, and signiﬁcant interactionswere found. Therefore, one may conclude that changing the environment of singlehairs that have been water-set at a higher humidity (60% RH) to a lower humiditycauses more rapid curl loss in short time intervals (2 h) than maintaining the hair atthe higher humidity. This more rapid curl loss occurs in spite of the fact thathair equilibrated at a lower humidity will contain less water [ 106] and exhibit
greater bending [ 107] and torsional stiffness [ 108] than hair equilibrated at a higherhumidity.The ﬁbers when taken from 60% to 10% RH lose water until they re-equilibratewith the new environment (approximately 16% moisture at 60% RH to 5% moistureat 10% RH [ 106]). During this transition stage, as water migrates out of the ﬁbers,hydrogen bonds are broken and reformed, and more rapid curl loss (set loss) occurs.At the longer time interval (24 h), the hair ﬁbers that were maintained at thehigher humidity are equal (in curl retention) once again to the ﬁbers transferred tothe lower humidity. Apparently, after equilibration of moisture at the lower humid-ity, the rate of curl loss becomes less than for hair maintained at the higher humidityallowing the curl loss to equalize. Presumably at even longer times, the curl loss forthe hair at the lower humidity would be less than for the hair at the higher humidity.
Diaz’s experiments were with hair tresses and in a sense were more pragmaticthan the single-ﬁber experiments; however, they include inter-ﬁber complicationsexcluded from the single-ﬁber test. Fiber friction increases with RH for keratinﬁbers [ 108], and effects from frictional contributions tend to enhance the setstability of the hair at the higher humidity. Nevertheless, Diaz’s results indicatethe same general picture as with single hairs. Therefore, these two types ofexperiments complement each other with regard to providing a better understandingof the mechanism of water-setting human hair.The following important insights are reﬂected in these results: Exposure ofwater-set hair to changes in humidity results in moisture either entering or leavingthe ﬁbers. The ﬂow of or transfer of strongly bound water either into or out of hairproduces cleavage of critical hydrogen bonds resulting in a decrease in water-setTable 4.2 Low humidityeffects on curl retention (all

stability. The behavior of hair equilibrated at different humidities may not reﬂect itsbehavior during the transition to different humidities, and changes in humidity areprobably more likely to be encountered in the real world than constant humidity.Water-setting hair provides a temporary reversible set to hair, because hydrogenbonds are involved. Therefore, a water set can be removed from hair by the transferof moisture either into or out of hair. Permanent waves, in contrast, are moreresistant to moisture transfer into and out of hair, because covalent bonding (thedisulﬁde bond) and other molecular changes are involved and covalent bonds arerelatively inert to moisture changes in hair.4.9 Set and SupercontractionSet has been deﬁned by Brown et al. [ 109] as a treatment that enables a keratin ﬁber
to maintain a length greater than its original length. As a contrast, supercontractionis the condition in which a keratin ﬁber is ﬁxed at a length less than its originallength [ 109]. Set is usually determined by a procedure similar to the one describedby Speakman [ 58]. Fibers are stretched to 40%, treated, then rinsed and tested fortheir ability to retain the extended length when placed in water or buffer at elevatedtemperatures. The criterion for “permanent” set is the resistance to lengthwiseshrinkage in boiling water. Supercontraction can also be followed by observinglengthwise changes in full-length ﬁbers or by microscopic observation of ﬁbersnippets [ 110].The setting process is generally considered a three-stage process. Stage 1 is thestretching stage. Stage 2 is the period of structural rearrangement, consisting of thetime period that the ﬁbers are held in the stretched state. Stage 3 is the recoveryperiod, the time after the external strain is removed.
Widely varying reaction conditions and gross alterations to the ﬁbers have beenmade during the course of the study of the mechanism(s) of setting, although itappears that most of the literature on setting is concerned with establishing a singlecommon mechanism for all treatments. Jenkins and Wolfram [ 111] suggested andprovided evidence indicating that more than one mechanism may exist for settingkeratin and highly altered keratin ﬁbers. The discussion in this section is primarilyconcerned with the conditions of wool setting that are related to the permanent-waving process. Therefore, a single mechanism is considered.When keratin ﬁbers are stretched in an aqueous medium in the presence of areducing agent, several bonds are broken owing to internal stresses resulting fromthe imposed strain. Hydrogen bonds are broken, their resistance to the imposedstrain decrease with increasing temperature [ 101]. The importance of hydrogen
bonds to stage 3 (recovery) and to structural rearrangement (stage 2) has beendemonstrated. Farnworth [ 112] showed that urea plus, a reducing agent, is capableof producing permanent set in keratin ﬁbers under conditions in which neitherreagent alone will produce permanent set. Therefore, the breaking of additional236 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
hydrogen bonds by urea permits structural rearrangements to occur in the presenceof a reducing agent that reduction alone cannot achieve.Weigmann et al. [ 113] and Milligan et al. [ 114] have clearly demonstrated theimportance of the disulﬁde and mercaptan groups to all three stages of the settingprocess. Elimination of mercaptan before stretching prevents permanent set. On theother hand, permanent set is enhanced by elimination of mercaptan before releasingstretched ﬁbers. Interestingly, mercaptan elimination in the latter circumstance maybe accomplished either by re-oxidation to the disulﬁde or higher oxidation products,or even by blocking mercaptan with active reagents such as iodoacetate [ 114]. Infact, Menkart et al. [ 115] have suggested that a larger amount of set results fromblocking mercaptan than from re-oxidation to disulﬁde. This suggestion is veryreasonable because blocking mercaptan permanently blocks disulﬁde mercaptan
interchange but re-oxidation to disulﬁde does not permanently prevent theinterchange.These experiments collectively demonstrate that structural reorganization duringthe setting of keratin ﬁbers in aqueous reducing agents is facilitated not onlythrough disulﬁde bond breakdown but also, to a large extent, through disulﬁde-mercaptan interchange reactions.Since keratin ﬁbers undergo crystallographic changes on stretching, X-raydiffraction can be used as a tool to study the setting mechanism. Setting ofhuman hair by various means produces an alpha to beta transformation [ 84].
Therefore, setting hair is clearly different from water setting which involvessmall reversible deformations and only hydrogen bond breakage. Therefore, duringsetting some of the alpha helices of the ﬁlamentous regions of the cortical cells arestretched, and a beta conﬁguration is formed. A number of forces includingcovalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, salt linkages, Van der Waals forces, and stericinterferences oppose stretching and setting. The weak links in these “chains offorces” opposing strain probably exist primarily in the matrix of the cortex, thedisulﬁde bonds in the intermediate ﬁlaments and in the A layer and exocuticle of thecuticle.Certainly in aqueous reducing solutions, the weakest links in these “chains of
forces” are the disulﬁde bonds and those associated hydrogen bonds that are brokenand interchanged. These are the actions that permit the structural rearrangements inthe microﬁbrils and other structural rearrangements that are critical to setting.However, as pointed out by Wortmann and Souren [ 1] a main effect of reductionor the breakage of disulﬁde bonds in setting must be on the crystalline ﬁlaments,that is on the interactions between the crystalline structures and the reorganizationthat occurs involving those structures rather than on the disulﬁde bonds themselves.In addition to cortical changes, extensive changes occur in the cuticle duringpermanent waving. Wickett and Barman [ 11] have demonstrated that a satisfactorypermanent wave can be achieved by greater cuticle/cortex reduction than with existingthioglycolate waves. The A layer and exocuticle contain high concentrations ofcystine residues [ 116] and are therefore highly reactive to reducing agents. The
endocuticle, on the other hand, contains relatively little cystine [ 116]. Thereforethe primary reaction of the reducing agent in the cuticle will be with the stiff resistant4.9 Set and Supercontraction 237
A layer and exocuticle regions. These stiff cuticle layers will be softened allowingfor structural rearrangement. Upon re-oxidation, the macromolecules of the A layerand exocuticle layers will be re-hardened to a new conﬁguration. Thus a combina-tion of cortical and cuticle changes occurs in permanent-waving to provide a new“permanent” shape to the keratin ﬁber consistent with the observations of Wortmannand Kure [ 2,3].One might also anticipate greater cuticle contribution to a permanent wave inﬁne hair as compared to coarse hair, because of the greater ratio of cuticle to cortexin ﬁne hair; see Wolfram and Lindemann [ 117]. This is because thin and coarse haircontains the same number of cuticle layers, with essentially the same thickness.Therefore, ﬁne hair contains a greater proportion of cuticle to cortex than coarsehair. Assuming a 4-micron-thick cuticle, for coarse, 100-micron-diameter hair
ﬁbers the cuticle would comprise only 15% of the ﬁber cross section. However,for thin, 40-micron hair ﬁbers, the cuticle would comprise 36% of the total ﬁbercross-section.Fine hair is known to be resistant to waving. This effect is likely due to its highcuticle content. Wortmann and Kure [ 2] have demonstrated that the cuticledecreases the rate of reduction of hair ﬁbers and it most likely plays a role in thepermanent set of human hair due to its stiffness. The cuticle may play a lesserrole than the cortex in permanent waving, nevertheless, it is difﬁcult to conceive ofthe cuticle not playing an important role in waving reactions that involve reduction,shaping, and re-hardening of the high-sulfur A layers and exocuticle layers.Hair swelling agents, such as concentrated solutions of alkali metal halides [ 118]or aqueous solutions of reducing agents [ 119], are capable of promoting supercon-
traction as well as setting; see the section on hair straightening in this Chapter. Thetypes of reagents that promote supercontraction suggest that hydrogen bondbreakage is important to supercontraction. Burley [ 120] has shown that disulﬁde-mercaptan interchange can also be involved in supercontraction. In addition, keratinﬁbers, while undergoing supercontraction, suffer a loss in birefringence, and thealpha-X-ray diagram disappears [ 121,122]. This suggests molecular reorientationin the ﬁlamentous regions of the cortex. The alpha keratin is thus rearranged to aless organized structure. Therefore, supercontraction, with the exception of thedriving force, and the ﬁnal molecular orientation is very much related mechanisti-cally to the process of setting.In the ﬁrst edition of this book, I proposed that one might consider the curling(waving) of a human hair ﬁber as a combination of setting and supercontraction.
A bent hair ﬁber that is treated with an aqueous solution of a reducing agent isundergoing concomitant extension (setting) and compression (which should bemore analogous to supercontraction than to setting). If one perceives the wavingor straightening of human hair in this manner, one may then apply the testingprocedures and mechanisms for these two phenomena to arrive at a picture of thewaving process. In the future, perms and straighteners that are more resistant towashout are possible by developing compositions that provide for more extensivemolecular conformational changes (loss of alpha keratin structure) as described byWong et al. [ 123] for alkaline hair straighteners.238 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
Wortmann and Kure [ 1] have been able to provide a model that explains the setbehavior obtained in the permanent waving of human hair in terms of the bendingstiffness of single hairs during the reduction and the oxidation reactions. Wortmannand Kure propose a distribution of Young’s moduli from the hair surface to thecenter of the ﬁber and a diffusion controlled breakdown during reduction. Thismodel is simple, yet elegant, and it is highly satisfactory in spite of the fact that itdoes not consider the two-phase composite nature of the cortex of human hair.Feughelman [ 4] extended this model, by proposing a model for setting a bent ﬁberand taking into account the two-phase composite nature of the cortex of keratinﬁbers.Even though the criterion for permanent set in the wool industry is markedlydifferent from that in the hair-waving industry (boiling water vs. neutral pH
shampoos near room temperature), much can be gained in the understanding ofhair waving and straightening by using the test procedures employed for wool andby drawing analogies to the mechanisms of setting and supercontraction.4.10 Swelling: During and After TreatmentThe microscopic method (change in volume) [ 124] and the centrifugation method(change in weight) have been used for studying the swelling of human hair byaqueous solutions of mercaptans. Both the rate and the extent of the swelling ofhuman hair by mercaptan solutions are pH-dependent and increase dramaticallywith increasing pH above neutrality [ 29,125]. At high pH, using a high solution-to-hair ratio, swelling in excess of 300% is possible with thioglycolic acid even atrelatively short reaction times [ 125]. The swelling of human hair in aqueous
mercaptan solutions is a direct reﬂection of the chemical reactions occurring insidethe ﬁbers and can therefore be described in terms of the reactivity considerationsoutlined in the section on the kinetics of this reaction.Shansky [ 126] studied the swelling action of hair ﬁbers during reduction,rinsing, and chemical neutralization—i.e., a simulated cold wave process. Duringthe reaction with mercaptan, the swelling action is extensive. Upon rinsing,swelling continues, but at a reduced rate. This decreased swelling rate is attributedto osmotic forces arising from the rapid decrease in salt concentration outside thehair compared to inside the ﬁber. During neutralization, de-swelling occurs.Hair ﬁbers reduced and re-oxidized approach the original ﬁber diameter.Eckstrom [ 124] suggested that the milder the conditions of reduction, the closerthe ﬁber will return to its original dry-state diameter on neutralization.
Fiber diameter determined in the wet or swollen state is sensitive to changesproduced by damaging treatments like permanent waves or bleaches. The swellingaction of permanent-waved hair [ 29] and bleached ﬁbers [ 31] is greater than inunaltered hair and has been used to estimate the extent of alteration produced byreduction and re-oxidation [ 30]. For additional discussion on hair swelling, seeChaps. 1and9.4.10 Swelling: During and After Treatment 239
4.11 Permanent Waving of Human HairCharles Nessler is a key ﬁgure in the invention of the permanent wave in London in1905 [ 127]. The ﬁrst permanent waves were concentrated solutions of alkali(5–15%) or alkaline sulﬁtes [ 127,128] that reacted with hair at elevatedtemperatures. In these treatments, high temperatures were achieved by usingcurling irons, chemical heating pads, or electric heaters [ 129].Current permanent waves are vastly superior to the early hot waves and do notrequire elevated temperature; thus the designation “cold waves.” Cold wavesbecame successful during World War II and have not changed substantially fornearly 70 years. These products are based on mercaptans or sulﬁtes, the mostcommon of these being thioglycolic acid, which is generally employed at a concen-tration of approximately 0.6 N and a pH of 9 to 9.5.Sulﬁte waves employ a pH near 6 and a hydrogen peroxide neutralizer. This type
of product generally claims to provide a wave that does not “frizzle” the hair, i.e., isgentle to your hair, and can be used on any type of hair (damaged or undamaged)[130]. This image is consistent with the fact that sulﬁte is a weaker reducing agentthan thioglycolate (see the discussion on the reduction of hair by sulﬁte earlier inthis Chapter).Thioglycolate and sulﬁte waves are the primary reducing agents used in homepermanent waves today. Although as indicated, glycerylmonothioglycolate (GMT)and cysteamine hydrochloride are being used in the professional ﬁeld in commer-cial acid waves or waves that are formulated closer to neutral pH. GMT requires acovering cap and the heat of a dryer to accomplish sufﬁcient reduction to providea satisfactory permanent wave [ 26].4.11.1 Cold Wave Formulations and Making ColdWave ProductsA typical thiol permanent wave consists of two compositions. The ﬁrst, a reducing
solution often called a waving lotion, is a composition similar to that in Table 4.3.T omake this permanent wave formulation, ﬁrst melt the emulsiﬁer/wetting agents(steareth-20) and add them to oxygen free water, under an inert atmosphere, atTable 4.3 A thiol permanentwave waving lotionIngredient PercentThioglycolic acid 6.0Steareth-20 2.5Fragrance 0.5Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid 0.2Colors As requiredWater q.s.aAmmonium hydroxide To pH 9.3aq.s., add water to 100%240 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
about 50/C14while stirring. Cool to room temperature. Add about 3% concentratedammonium hydroxide, then add thioglycolic acid with stirring. Add other ingredientsand adjust the pH with ammonium hydroxide or the preferred form of alkalinity.Consider the following precautions for making thiol perms. One should use alined vessel [glass, plastic (polyethylene or teﬂon or other inert plastic) or stainlesssteel]. One should avoid contact with all metals, because thiols react withmany metals to form colored salts. Note, salts of thioglycolic acid may be handledin stainless steel, but thioglycolic acid may not. Also minimize heat wheneverthioglycolic acid is present. Exposure to air and oxygen should be avoided, forexample use oxygen free water and package with a minimum of headspace, becausethiols are sensitive to air oxidation (Table 4.4).A milder waving lotion sometimes called a softwave (Table 4.5) can be made inthe following manner. Add the laureth-23 to water at 70
/C14with stirring. Cool to roomtemperature and dissolve the bisulﬁte and the sulﬁte. Then add the fragrance andadjust the pH to 8 with ammonium hydroxide. Oxygen free water should be used andthe mixing in an inert atmosphere. For the softwave product, the neutralizer describedabove in Table 4.4for the ammonium thioglycolate wave can also be used.4.11.2 Acid WavesAcid waves are generally based on glycerolmonothioglycolate (GMT) althoughsome bisulﬁte systems are also sold as acid waves.

lotion itself consists of two parts because GMT is not stable for long periods of timein water.To make the acid wave, for Part I of the waving lotion described in Table 4.6,add glycerol thioglycolate to glycerine (oxygen free) in an inert atmosphere takingthe same precautions as described for the thiol wave. For Part II of the wavinglotion, dissolve the sulfonate and the neodol in water; then add the remainingingredients in the order listed in the formula. Immediately before application tothe hair, mix parts I and part II of the waving lotions.Other cold-wave formulations and related products are described by Gershonet al. [ 130], and by Flick [ 131,132]. Product ingredient labels provide the most up-to-date qualitative information on these types of products.4.11.3 Properties of Cold-Waved Hair
4.11.3 Properties of Cold-Waved HairThe chemical changes produced in hair by permanent waving, as indicated byamino acid analysis, are quantitatively small and do not reﬂect the vast structuralchanges that have taken place in the ﬁbers during a permanent wave. Smalldecreases in cystine [ 53,54,133] and corresponding increases in cysteic acid[53,54,133] and in cysteine [ 53,54] have been reported. Small quantities ofmixed disulﬁde [ 133], sorbed thioglycolic [ 53], and dithiodiglycolic acids [ 133]have also been detected in hair that has undergone cold-waving treatments. Zahnet al. [ 134] also demonstrated small quantities of intermediate oxidation products ofcystine in permanent-waved hair. For additional details of the chemical changesoccurring in hair that has undergone permanent waving, see Chap. 2.The wet tensile properties of hair are decreased by permanent waving. How-ever, the dry tensile properties rem ain virtually unchanged; see Chap. 9forTable 4.6 Waving lotion for

additional details. The torsional behavio r of hair that has been permanent-wavedis also changed. Bogaty [ 135] demonstrated that waved hair is more rigid in thedry state yet less rigid in the wet state t han unwaved hair. Schwartz and Knowles[136] determined that the frictional resis tance of human hair is increased bypermanent waving providing evidence of changes (damage) in the cuticle ofhair. Increased ﬁber friction results in more difﬁcult combing of hair that hasundergone permanent-wave treatment. F or additional details on the changes inthese properties, see Chap. 9.The swelling capacity of permanent-waved hair increases in proportion to thedamage rendered by the waving process [ 124]. Increased swelling is evidence ofcuticle and cortical damage to hair. Greater swelling produces a substantial increasein the chemical reactivity of hair toward those reactions in which diffusion is rate-
limiting. And since most of the whole-ﬁber chemical reactions that human hairundergoes are diffusion-controlled, permanent waving can markedly alter thechemical character of human scalp hair.4.11.4 The Nature of the Cold-Wave Process4.11.4.1 The Reduction StepA very important factor in cold-waving hair on heads is the solution-to-hair ratio,which is limited by the capillary spaces between the ﬁbers, and the amount ofsolution absorbed into the hair excluding solution runoff. Assuming a solution tohair ratio of 2:1 for a two-fold addition of reducing solution to hair, a 0.6 Mmercaptan solution, and a favorable equilibrium constant (for thioglycolate atalkaline pH), there is insufﬁcient mercaptan for total reduction of the disulﬁdebonds in hair. Randebrook and Eckert [ 137] and Reed et al. [ 138] suggested thatonly about 20% of the cystine in hair is reduced during an average thioglycolatepermanent-wave treatment. Less reduction occurs for an average sulﬁte wave.
During the reduction step, a highly reduced zone proceeds into the cuticle andeventually into the outer regions of the cortex. This leaves an inner zone ofunreduced hair. The relative quantities of reduced vs. unreduced ﬁber depend onthe reducing agent (thioglycolate vs. sulﬁte), its concentration, the solution-to-hairratio, pH of the reaction medium, time of reaction, ﬁber diameter, and the conditionof the hair; variables which, for the most part, have already been considered in thisChapter. For another useful discussion of the waving process, see the article byGershon et al. [ 130].The relatively high cleavage of cystine residues and the resultant high concen-
tration of cysteinyl residues produced from the reaction of thioglycolic acid orsulﬁte with hair and the physical stress from curling the ﬁber produce molecularreorientation that is facilitated by disulﬁde-mercaptan interchange. Reductionoccurs in the high-sulfur regions of the ﬁbers, i.e., the A layer and exocuticle ofthe cuticle and the matrix and intermediate ﬁlaments of the cortex, permitting4.11 Permanent Waving of Human Hair 243
molecular reorientation and structural changes to occur in both the cuticle and cortex,as described in the section on setting and supercontraction. Molecular changesincluding reorientation in the intermediate ﬁlaments are believed to be very importantto the cold wave process as suggested by Wortmann and Souren [ 3]. However,changes in the high disulﬁde regions of the cuticle are also involved as demonstratedby the relationship of ﬁber stiffness and the gradient of stiffness changes involved inthe permanent wave process as shown by Wortmann and Kure [ 1,2].4.11.4.2 RinsingCessation of the reduction reaction and removal of most of the reducing agent tominimize hair damage is the primary function of rinsing. The continued increase inswelling during the rinse by osmotic forces has already been described.4.11.4.3 Creep PeriodAfter rinsing, the hair is often wrapped in a towel and maintained in the desired
conﬁguration for a given period of time (up to 30 min). This step has been called the“creep period” and was introduced into the waving process in the early 1950s [ 139].Continued molecular reorientation through disulﬁde-mercaptan interchange andsecondary bond formation (other than covalent bond formation) occurs duringthis step. Since secondary bonds contribute to wave stability [ 140], this step isimportant to the total permanent-wave process.4.11.4.4 NeutralizationNeutralization or re-oxidation is accomplished primarily through chemical meanssuch as by mild oxidation for thioglycolate waves or mild oxidation or mild alkalifor sulﬁte waves. Neutralization rapidly decreases the mercaptan content in theﬁbers, decreasing the probability of disulﬁde-mercaptan interchange, and therebystabilizes the permanent wave.4.12 Hair Straightening and Hair Straightener Products4.12.1 Hair Straightener Compositions
4.12.1 Hair Straightener CompositionsDuring the past century, several different types of products have been used tostraighten curly to kinky hair. In this discussion, we will consider ﬁve differenttypes of products/processes used for this purpose.244 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
Gums, resins or waxes are used to temporarily straighten the hair by plastering itdown. These are generally very simple mixtures such as petrolatum and waxes orparafﬁns or even more complex waxes, gums or resinous ingredients withfragrances. Obviously, these products do not alter the hair chemically, and thus,are not permanent straighteners.Hot combs and straightening irons have been widely used for straightening hair.In fact, some people actually iron their hair straight with a clothes iron. Straighten-ing irons sometimes called crimping irons or curling irons generally are electricallyheated crimping devices that open and are then clamped on the hair to remove oradd curl. Oftentimes, petrolatum based oils called pressing oils are used in con-junction with the iron or the hot comb to lubricate the hair so the device can slidemore easily through the hair and thus facilitate this process. These oils usually
contain waxes and hair conditioners in a petrolatum base that is perfumed. This typeof process produces only temporary straightening, functioning partly throughcohesive and adhesive forces in a highly viscous system to help keep the ﬁbersparallel.Alkaline based straighteners, sometimes called chemical relaxers, are usedprimarily by men or by women with short hair and are the main permanentstraightening products used today. Alkaline straighteners usually contain 1–10%sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide or a combination of thesealkaline ingredients or their salts. Alkaline straighteners are often sold as cremescontaining conditioning ingredients such as stearic acid, cetyl and/or stearyl alco-hol, mineral oil, etc. that thicken the product, see Table 4.7.These alkaline hair relaxers are highly viscous creams. The high viscosity
functions to help control run-off, because care must be taken to avoid contactwith the eyes and minimize contact with the scalp to prevent alkaline burns. Thehair should be washed prior to application. Product use instructions frequentlyrecommend placing petrolatum along the hair-line and on the ears before applica-tion of the straightener. The product is then combed through the hair starting nearthe root ends, while combing away from the scalp. After processing, the hair isrinsed carefully under a running tap.Table 4.7 An alkaline hairstraighteneraIngredient PercentStearic acid 17Oleic acid 3Stearyl alcohol 2Glycerine 5Sodium hydroxide 9.5Fragrance 0.5Water q.s.baDissolve the alkali and glycerine in the water and then heat to90/C14.

4.12.2 Reactions of Hair StraightenersThe section of this Chapter entitled, Side reactions during the reduction of keratinﬁbers with mercaptans , summarizes the chemistry of the reactions of alkalinereagents with hair proteins. As indicated, alkalies react with cystine groups produc-ing lanthionyl residues, a stable thioether crosslink. They also react with peptidebonds, hydrolytically cleaving this linkage, producing acid and amine groups. Thereaction of alkaline species with amide groups of proteins produces acidic residuesof aspartic and glutamic acids. Chemical hair straighteners and relaxers are amongthe top consumer complaint products including complaints dealing with hair break-age, hair damage and scalp burns. While many of these complaints are due toproduct misuse by either the consumer or a hair stylist, the incidence of complaintsis still very high relative to other products.Wong et al. [ 123] determined that alkaline hair straighteners provide the
most permanent hair straightening. These authors examined ten different reagentsfor hair swelling, supercontraction and permanent hair straightening. Theyfound that “permanent” straightening can be achieved only when the hair ﬁberhas supercontracted more than 5%, see the data of Table 4.8. Furthermore, thesescientists demonstrated that supercontracting agents like lithium chloride, whichcause supercontraction with virtually no cystine reduction, can also produce per-manent hair straightening. Therefore, they concluded that the molecular confor-mational changes that accompany supercontraction, e.g., part of which is therearrangement of alpha-keratin to a less organized structure (see the Sect. 4.9) aremore important to permanent hair straightening than the reduction reaction. Fur-thermore, this result also suggests that these molecular conformational changes aremore important to this process than lanthionine formation.
The pH of alkaline straighteners varies from about 12 to above 13 and damage tothe hair from these products is largely related to pH. Guanidine carbonate andcalcium hydroxide are often used in combination in some products. A lithiumhydroxide product with a pH as low as 12.8 can be made that is quite effective.Table 4.8 Permanent straightening by several reagents and supercontractionComposition Straightening Swelling % SupercontractionNaOH (1 N) pH 14 Permanent >40% 5.7NaOH (0.1 N) pH 13 Temporary 40% 0THP (1 M) pH 8.5 Permanent >50% 6TGA (1.2 M) pH 9.6 Temporary 80% 2LiCl (40%) Permanent 60% 11.5Boiling water Permanent >15% 6DTT (0.8 M) pH 3.5 Temporary >50% 0Resorcinol (40%) Permanent >50% 10Hot PressaTemporary – 0Reduction/Hot PressaPermanent – 5–10aMost of the above data is from Wong et al. [ 123] except for these two facts from the paper byOgawa et al. [ 141]246 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
Of course other additives are used to control the viscosity to make a safer and amore aesthetic product.Wong et al. [ 123] demonstrated that for hair straightening, unlike permanentwaving, the application of an external force is not necessary because the transitionsthat occur while the ﬁber is supercontracting provide sufﬁcient stress to straightenthe ﬁber. Furthermore, reducing solutions such as thioglycolic acid (TGA 1.2 M atpH 9.6) or dithiothreitol (DTT 0.8 M at pH 3.5) even though they cause extremeswelling (greater than 50% increase in diametric swelling) do not provide perma-nent hair straightening because they do not provide supercontraction beyond 2%(with the accompanying molecular rearrangements), see Table 4.8. Sodium hydrox-ide (1 N) can straighten hair in about 20 min but it takes more than 1 h to straightenhair with either LiCl or cuprammonium hydroxides, suggesting one reason for thesuperiority of sodium hydroxide to these other treatments.
Ogawa et al. [ 141], only a few years ago, provided additional insights into themechanism of permanent hair straightening. These scientists demonstrated both byX-ray diffraction and high pressure differential scanning calorimetry that supercon-traction of around 12.5% is accompanied by and is likely caused by the transfor-mation of alpha-helical proteins to amorphous proteins (as explained by Wonget al., see Table 4.9). This irreversible molecular transformation stabilizes thestraightened hair ﬁber providing permanence to hair straightening.Ogawa et al. [ 141] conﬁrmed the long known facts that reductive methods or hot
irons when used separately provide only temporary hair straightening in which thehair will revert to its original curvature, or close to it, either by washing or onexposure to high humidity. However, these scientists demonstrated that by combin-ing reducing solutions such as TGA or TGA/DTDG (dithiodiglycolic acid (DTDG))followed by a hot press application immediately after the reduction that permanentstraightening can be achieved. This is the basis for the process called Japanese hairstraightening or Thermal Reconditioning. These scientists further demonstratedthat this type of permanent straightening is also accompanied by the transformationof alpha-helical (crystalline) proteins to amorphous proteins. Thus, ThermalReconditioning involves supercontraction of hair ﬁbers (see Table 4.9).Similar to Wong et al. [ 123], Ogawa and associates found 5–8% supercon-
traction as optimal for permanent straightening. With their reductive-hot pressstraightening systems, Ogawa et al. found that approximately 90% of the initialcystine content was retained in the straightened hair with about 10% additionalcystine as cysteic acid, suggesting no lanthionine formation during this process.Lanthionine is formed from beta-elimination of cystine residues. Since cystine isTable 4.9 Supercontractionand crystallinity of hair fromOgawa et al.

fully accounted for, lanthionine could not be formed during this process. Also, sincethe lysine content was essentially unchanged by this reaction, no lysino-alaninecross-links are formed during this process either.As mentioned earlier, another type of hair straightener is based on a reducingagent without the use of hot irons. This type of straightener is related com-positionally to permanent waves. These are thioglycolate and sulﬁte based hairstraighteners. The chemistry for these products is essentially the same as for thepermanent wave based thioglycolate and sulﬁte based products. However, compo-sitionally these products do differ subtly from permanent waves. The reducingsolution of a hair straightener is often called a relaxer solution rather than a wavinglotion. In general, relaxer solutions of hair straighteners are more viscous com-positions than permanent waving lotions and thus often contain thickening agents.
These are usually creams that are thickened with polymers such as carbopol, e.g.,carbopol 941, or glyceryl monostearate, stearic acid or long chain alcohols, see theformula in Table 4.10. The relaxer solution of thioglycolate straighteners is alsoslightly lower in pH usually 8.8–9.1 as compared to 9.2–9.6 for permanent wavinglotions. For straightening with this type of composition it is necessary to comb thehair straight while the hair is in the reduced state.An even lower pH product is based on sodium sulﬁte or even ammoniumbisulﬁte. The pH of this latter product can be as low as 7.6. As one might expect,this type of product is not as effective at straightening very curly hair as the alkalinestraighteners and it must be left on the hair for a longer period of time (as long as50 min) to be effective.The neutralizers of thiol reducing hair straighteners (Table 4.10) are similar tothose of permanent wave products and are usually based on hydrogen peroxide or

sodium bromate. The sulﬁte based systems use either a similar oxidizing neutralizeror an alkaline system described earlier. The higher viscosity for hair straighteners isto facilitate holding the hair reasonably straight. However, to effectively straightenthe hair with these products one must periodically comb and stretch the hairstraight.As indicated by the data of Table 4.8, the reductive type of hair straightener thatdoes not employ hot irons does not provide supercontraction nor a loss of crystal-linity. Therefore, it does not provide permanent hair straightening. In addition, thissame redox chemistry when applied to a permanent wave provides more perma-nence for a wave than for hair straightening. The molecular rearrangements thatproduce permanent straightening and permanent waving (bending) involve someform of compressive forces on the ﬁbers (supercontraction in bending) that either
accompanies or facilitates the molecular rearrangements necessary for some per-manent. Note that in reductive type straighteners extension or combing the hair isused and not bending as in a curl for waving and straightening is less permanentthan waving.4.12.3 Damage by Hair Straightening ProductsThe wax, resinous petrolatum type of hair straighteners do not alter the hairchemically and do not damage it. When used with lubricating oils, these productscan help prevent damage to the hair. On the other hand, hot combs and straighteningirons or curling irons are also temporary hair straightening or curling treatments,but these products can damage the hair [ 142]. Of course the reductive hair relaxerproducts also damage the hair and despite their advertising Japanese hair straight-ening also damages hair. However, the alkaline hair straightening products are themost damaging of all hair straightening products.4.12.3.1 Damage by Heat Straightening
4.12.3.1 Damage by Heat StraighteningThermal treatments have been shown to produce decomposition of tryptophanresidues to kyneurenine type oxidation products, both thermally and via oxidation.In addition, thermally induced changes produce yellowing of white hair andbleached hair shows a slight darkening from thermally induced changes [ 142].These color changes most likely arise from further oxidation of the abovekyneurenine products. Furthermore, treatment of hair tresses either by a single ormultiple treatments reveals a gradual increase in combing forces as a function ofthermal exposure time.4.12 Hair Straightening and Hair Straightener Products 249
ONHCOHNCOOHNHONHA tryptophan residue in hair Opening of the tryptophan ring to a Kyneurenine productEven though most of the thermal studies of hair have involved Caucasian hair orwool ﬁber [ 142–149] the chemical changes that occur on straight to wavy Cauca-sian hair or to curly to highly coiled African hair should be relatively similar.However, less degradation of tryptophan occurs with heavily pigmented hair vs.lightly pigmented hair of the same type [ 142]. This effect suggests a retardation ofthe thermal degradation of these chromophoric reaction products and a similarity tophotochemical degradation of these same amino acid residues in hair. Furthermore,it suggests that thermal degradation of tryptophan likely involves free radicalattack.After thermal treatments, hair switches generally show a small decrease incombing forces [ 142]. However, after shampooing the combing forces are distinctly
higher than for control hair. These effects were explained by thermal treatments thatdrive lipid material to the hair surface that is removed by shampooing, thus dryingout the hair and unmasking surface damage to the ﬁbers [ 142].4.12.3.2 Damage by Reductive Hair StraightenersDamage by reduction-oxidation type hair straighteners should produce damagesimilar to that of reduction-oxidation permanent wave products providing adecrease of about 5–20% in the wet tensile properties [ 150]. The chemistry of thereactions of permanent waves with hair involves reduction of disulﬁde bonds,followed by molecular shifting produced by stressing the hair on rollers followedby re-oxidation. The chemistry of reduction-oxidation hair straighteners is similarinvolving reduction of disulﬁde bonds and molecular shifting produced by stressing
the hair by combing it straight followed by re-oxidation. One unanswered questionis how much damage is done to the hair by combing it straight in the reduced state.The question involving a lack of permanence in straightening African Americanhair by a reduction-oxidation system was addressed in a previous part of thisChapter.250 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
For the reduction step by this type of hair straightener, most of the commonlyused reducing agents for hair have been used, the primary ones being TGA andsulﬁte. Albrecht and Wolfram [ 52] suggested that for low cleavage levels, sulﬁte isa more effective setting agent than thioglycolate, but at higher cleavage levels,thioglycolate is the most effective reducing g agent.The pH of relaxer solutions of TGA hair straighteners is generally slightly lower(pH 8.8–9.1) than in permanent waving lotions (pH 9.2–9.6). Lower pH producesless disulﬁde cleavage and at low cleavage levels less hair damage results. So tominimize damage for this type of product sulﬁte is the preferred reducing agent. Inaddition, stressing the hair by combing it straight is a less controlled action thancurling the hair on rollers. Therefore, considering only hair damage sulﬁte would bethe preferred reducing agent.The re-oxidation step with thiols usually involves mild oxidizing agents (sodium
bromate or hydrogen peroxide) or when sulﬁte is the reducing agent, effectivereformation of cystine can be achieved with alkaline solutions generally above pH 8,which reverses the sulﬁtolysis reaction below reforming cystine disulﬁde:From the perspective of tensile damage, I would expect similar tensile damagefrom hair straightening and a permanent wave [ 150]. However, I would add thecaution that more damage could be produced from “misuse” of the products and alack of care during combing hair in the reduced state. I could not ﬁnd any scientiﬁcliterature that directly examines the tensile properties of African American hairtreated with reduction-oxidation type hair straighteners. However, a reference byKamath et al. [ 151] compared a reduction straightener without oxidation with analkaline straightener and determined the fatiguing properties of the ﬁbers showinggreater damage to the African type hair from the alkaline straightener, seeTable 4.11.
The hair used in this study was from a Black male age 31 and had never beentreated with chemical or heat relaxers. After shampooing rinsing and drying, half ofthe ﬁbers were treated with a commercial alkaline creme relaxer, stroking theproduct through the hair with the ﬁngers for 20 min and then rinsing andshampooing. The other half of the ﬁbers were treated with TGA using 5%thioglycolic acid at pH 9.3 for 20 min and then the hair was rinsed and shampooed.Table 4.11 Damage toAfrican American hair by analkaline relaxer and areduction relaxer [ 151]% Failures during 0–500 cycles of fatiguingTreatment 10 g load 30 g loadUntreated 18 50Alkali relaxed 58 60TGA (air oxidized) 46 564.12 Hair Straightening and Hair Straightener Products 251
4.12.3.3 Damage Comparison Between a Reductive and AlkalineHair StraightenerThe hair used in this study was from a Black male age 31. It had never been treatedwith chemical or heat treatments. Both of these types of relaxers weaken the hair.During treatment with the alkaline straightener 8% of the ﬁbers broke (duringtreatment), but for the TGA treatment zero ﬁbers broke suggesting more damageby the alkaline straightener in spite of the fact that a chemical neutralizer was notused after the TGA treatment.The fatiguing process involves attaching weights to the ﬁbers and then droppingthe weights repeatedly to stress the hair analogous to the way it might be stressed bycontinuous combing. The data shows the greatest distinction between untreated andtreated ﬁbers using the lower weights. Therefore this condition is probably the mostmeaningful indicator of damage to the hair. These data clearly show damage by
both straightener treatments; however, greater damage is produced by the alkalinestraightener providing 8% vs. 0% failures in the hair treated by the alkalinestraightener vs. the reduction straightener simply by stroking the product throughthe hair and 58% failures vs. 46% failures by fatiguing the hair at the 10 g load seeTable 4.11.Other than the example described in Table 4.11, damage by alkalinestraighteners is described only generally in the literature. Nevertheless, alkalinerelaxers are among the top consumer complaint products because of hairbreakage and alkaline burns. These products are combed through the hair startingnear the root ends and combing away from the scalp. However, Wong et al. [ 123]
demonstrated, permanent hair straightening is generally achieved without theapplication of an external force. So combing an alkaline straightener into the hairis mainly for even distribution of product throughout the hair and not for straight-ening of the hair per se. After processing, the hair is rinsed carefully with runningtap water.From a chemical perspective of hair damage, we understand what happensduring alkaline hair straightening more than we understand the physical impli-cations, however, we do know from the fatiguing experiment by Kamath et al. [ 151](Table 4.11) that alkaline straightened African American hair is more brittle and itbreaks more readily than un-straightened hair from that same source. We also knowthat supercontraction of 5–9% [ 123] occurs during alkaline hair straightening andthat straightened hair ﬁbers absorb dye more readily than controls [ 141], indicativeof a more porous ﬁber and hair damage.
of a more porous ﬁber and hair damage.From a chemical perspective, we know that chemical changes occur in theprotein regions of all hair structures as well as in the fatty acid regions of the cellmembrane complex. Ionization of carboxylic acid and phenolic groups of the aminoacid side chains also occurs producing a very negatively charged ﬁber surface.Alkaline hydrolysis of amide and peptide bonds and beta elimination of cystine areamong the many chemical reactions that occur with alkaline hair straighteners.These collective actions allow the unfolding of alpha-helical chains (crystalline252 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
proteins) and reorganization in the ﬁlamentous regions to less structured proteins. Itwould also appear that greater changes occur in the concave part of a curl than in theconvex part to allow for permanent straightening to occur. The concave part of acurl being analogous to paracortical cells in wool ﬁber is higher in cystine richproteins [ 152,153] and contains more cross-links [ 152,153] and a higher ratio ofmatrix to intermediate ﬁlaments [ 154–156]Hydrolysis of ester and thioester groups of the cell membrane complex occurs atthe high pH conditions of alkaline hair straighteners which provides for removal of18-MEA from the hair surface [ 157] and weakening of CMC bonding betweencuticle and cortical cells. Beyond the delipidation of the ﬁber surface, the creationof lanthionine residues and loss of crystallinity, few speciﬁc reactions have beenreported for African type hair after treatment with alkaline straighteners. The lack
of more information is most likely from a lack of study. For more on hair damagesee the section in Chap. 10on hair breakage.4.12.4 Why Alkaline Hair Straighteners Are Permanentand Reductive Are Not But Reductives ProvideSome Permanence for CurlingThibaut et al. [ 158] studying hair from six persons of Caucasian, North African andAfrican descent found that the hair described as straight had three types of cellsarranged in a symmetrical annular arrangement. A core of paracortical type cellswere generally surrounded by mesocortical with orthocortical type cells in the outerpart of the cortex. However, for high curvature hair the cells were distributedasymmetrically with the orthocortical type cells predominately on the convexside of the curl and the paracortical type cells on the concave side, see Fig. 1.42.Bryson et al. [ 159] examined curved hair and straight hair from Japanese subjectsand found four types of cells rather than three, but found similar distributions to
those found by Thibaut et al.As explained in the previous section, when alkaline straighteners act on curvedhair ﬁbers, they cleave disulﬁde and peptide bonds producing supercontraction of8–10% and a decrease in crystallinity as shown by X-ray diffraction [ 141]. Tostraighten a curl, more contraction must be produced on the convex side of a curlthan on the concave side. Therefore more contraction is produced in the paracorticaltype cells or those containing a higher concentration of cystine [ 152,153] and ahigher proportion of matrix to intermediate ﬁlaments [ 154–156]. The alkalinestraightener also converts some cystine to lanthionine which creates an irreversiblesituation in that intermediate vicinity.With a reductive type straightener, no contraction occurs but elongation is
produced by combing the hair in the reduced state. However, with no contractivechanges in the region of the intermediate ﬁlaments and no irreversible bonds beingformed such as lanthionine, more mercaptan remains to provide reversible changes4.12 Hair Straightening and Hair Straightener Products 253
through disulﬁde-mercaptan interchange. Therefore, permanent straightening is notachieved.Now when we use the same reductive system to produce a curl there are a fewimportant differences. First and foremost, the hair is relatively straight to beginwith. Therefore the arrangement of cortical cell types are in an annular symmetricalfashion as in Fig. 1.42. Secondly, the action of the reducing agent is primarily on theorthocortical type cells which are in the outer regions of the cortex. The thirdimportant difference is that when a hair ﬁber is put into a curled conﬁguration it isstretched on the convex side and compressed or contracted on the concave side ofthe curl. Apparently these differences, include simultaneous compression andextension as opposed to stretching alone. I conclude that compression allows formore extensive molecular rearrangements analogous to supercontraction to occur
primarily in the orthocortical type cells which allows for some degree of perma-nence to the curvature change compared to similar but not identical changes in thestraightening process.4.13 DepilatoriesMost depilatories are of the same basic chemistry as thiol permanent waves and hairstraighteners, but are more reactive compositions. These products generally containthioglycolic acid formulated at a higher pH from 11 to 12.5, and therefore produce amore rapid and more complete reduction of the hair with greater alkaline degradation.See the section described earlier in this Chapter entitled, Side reactions during thereduction of hair with mercaptans that describes the reaction of hair with alkalinereagents. More complete reduction with alkaline degradation helps to fulﬁll thepurpose of a depilatory, i.e., to degrade the hair to the point that it can be removedor broken off easily by simply rubbing the area with a washcloth or other device.
Figure 4.1illustrates the swelling effects of a calcium thioglycolate depilatoryon hair. Figures 4.5,4.6and4.7depict damage induced to the cell membranecomplex of different parts of the ﬁber by reductive treatments. Thus, strongalkaline-reductive treatments degrade the hair proteins to the point where manyof these are solubilized in aqueous media.A very large order swelling occurs with depilatories because of the almostcomplete reduction of disulﬁde bonds in the A-layer and the exocuticle of thecuticle and the matrix and intermediate ﬁlaments of the cortex and because of thealkaline degradation. The reaction of a depilatory with human hair can be followednicely with optical microscopy by observing the large order swelling and the loss ofbirefringence that occurs through the moving boundary kinetics by observing theboundary as it moves rapidly from the periphery of the ﬁber to the core.The composition described in Table 4.12 is a thiol type depilatory. This product
can be made into either a cream or lotion by controlling the ratio of Part I to Part II.For higher viscosities, a higher ratio of Part I to Part II is used. To make thisdepilatory described in Table 4.12, disperse the ceteareth-20 into water (part II) by254 4 Reducing Human Hair Including Permanent Waving and Straightening
heating to 75 . Then add the cetearyl alcohol and mineral oil and continue heatingand stirring for about 10 min Cool to 40/C14while stirring, then add the individualingredients of Part III and homogenize. Similar precautions as described for thethiol wave such as the exclusion of oxygen and metals from the system must also beexercised for making a thiol depilatory.Another popular depilatory is the wax type product. This depilatory is applied asa viscous liquid over the hair area to be removed. It is often warmed under the tapprior to application and applied in the direction of hair growth. The wax issometimes covered with a paper-cloth oftentimes supplied with the product. Thecloth adheres to the sticky wax composition on the skin and is pulled in the directionagainst the hair growth removing much of the sticky wax with the hair. Thisprocedure is repeated until the desired area is depilated. The residual wax is thenwashed and peeled from the skin.
4.14 Safety Considerations for Permanent WavesAs for other reactive hair products, the primary safety concerns for permanentwaves generally arise from misuse or failure to comply with the product’s usageinstructions. Skin irritation, hair breakage, oral toxicity, sensitization, and scarringalopecia either have been reported in the literature or are referred to in the warninginstructions for home permanent-wave products.A safety assessment of thioglycolic acid by the CTFA [ 160] summarizes safetydata for thioglycolic acid, its salts and esters. Thioglycolates are moderately toxicyet comparable to bisulﬁte. Sodium thioglycolate has a LD50of 148 mg/kg (i.p. inrats) [ 161] vs. 115 mg/kg (i.v. in rats) for sodium bisulﬁte [ 162].Thioglycolate waving lotions can irritate skin [ 163]; however, irritation in homeuse is rare and may in part be related to the alkalinity of the system [ 164]. Among
the different thioglycolate salts, monoethanolamine thioglycolate is reported to beless irritating to skin than ammonium thioglycolate [ 165].Table 4.12 Depilatorycream/lotionIngredient PercentPart IMineral oil 4.5Ceteareth-20 2.5Cetearyl alcohol 3.0Part IIWater (oxygen free) q.s.aPart IIISodium thioglycolate 3.5Calcium thioglycolate 3.0Calcium hydroxide ~1.5 (to pH 11.5)Fragrance <1.0aq.s., add water to 100%4.14 Safety Considerations for Permanent Waves 255
Although ammonium thioglycolate has been reported as having a low sensitiza-tion potential [ 166], a few incidents of sensitization have been reported amonghairdressers where contact is frequent [ 166].Hair breakage and some permanent hair loss have been reported by Bergfeld[167] from misuse of these products, attributed to scarring alopecia. Bergfeld didnot specify the extent of hair loss observed; however, he concludes that side effectsfrom home permanent-waving products are minimal if consumers are aware of theirhair damage and any inherent skin diseases and if they comply with the productusage instructions [ 167]. A more recent update on the safety assessment ofthioglycolic acid its salts and esters has been published by Burnett et al. [ 168].This report included assessment of ammonium thioglycolate, butyl thioglycolate,calcium thioglycolate, ethanolamine thioglycolate, ethyl thioglycolate, glyceryl
thioglycolate, isooctyl thioglycolate, isopropyl thioglycolate, magnesium thioglycolatemethyl thioglycolate, potassium thioglycolate, sodium thioglycolate and thioglycolicacid. The conclusions of this report are that thioglycolates can be skin irritants in animaland in vitro tests and can also be sensitizing. However, “clinically signiﬁcant adversereactions to these ingredients used in depilatories are not commonly seen”.Thioglycolates are minimal to severe ocular irritants. They are not mutagenic andshow no evidence of carcinogenicity. Similar safety concerns exist for the thiol basedhair straighteners.For alkaline hair relaxers, care must be taken to avoid contact with the scalp to
prevent alkaline burns and hair breakage can result from misuse of these productsalso. Chemical hair straighteners and relaxers are among the top consumer com-plaint products including complaints of hair breakage, hair damage and scalp burns.While many of these complaints are due to product misuse by either the consumeror a hair stylist, the incidence of complaints are still very high relative to otherproducts.References1.

Chapter 5Bleaching and Oxidation of Human HairAbstract The physical chemistry of both chemical bleaching and sunlight effectson human hair are described. Recently we have become more aware of the criticalinvolvement of free radical chemistry on both chemical and sunlight oxidativeprocesses for human hair, therefore these effects are included. The beta layers of thecortical lipids with their high density of double bonds with allylic hydrogen atomsare very sensitive to free radical propagation reactions which can degrade the lipidsthemselves and also lead to protein degradation. Over the past decade our under-
standing of the biosynthesis and the structures of the melanin pigments hasimproved greatly; the most current biosynthetic pathway has been added to thisChapter. Initial oxidation reactions remove 18-MEA and free lipids from thesurface and between cuticle cells. When metals like iron or copper are presentfree radical chemistry is increased leading to degradation of lipids and enhancedprotein degradation not only at disulﬁde bonds but even at peptide bonds. Oxidativecleavage of disulﬁde bonds inside cuticle cells also occurs. Degradation of disulﬁdebonds inside cortical cells occurs next as well as degradation of hair pigments.Other amino acid functional groups are attacked and oxidatively degraded.5.1 Introduction
5.1 IntroductionSince the 4th Edition, we have added to our learning about photochemical effectson hair, photoprotection of hair, the surface chemistry of photobleached andchemically bleached hair and the properties of and the biosynthesis of differenthair pigments. We have discovered that the beta layers of the cuticle are moresensitive to nucleophilic attack by species such as the hydroperoxide anion andmercaptans, but beta layers of the cortical lipids with their multiplicity of doublebonds (oleic plus palmitoleic acids, plus cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate) andtertiary hydrogen atoms (cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate) are more sensitive tofree radical chemistry. On the other hand, the proteinaceous membranes of theCMC are resistant to non-radical oxidizing and reducing agents. An expandedC.R.

section in this Chapter deals with free radical chemistry of the important groups inhair and other types of damaging reactions of hair bleaches, oxidation dyes andsunlight degradation. The effects of these reactions on adhesion failure or crackformation in the hair ﬁber are also described.A new section entitled Hair pigmentation and genetics summarizing the genes andSNP’s (single nucleotide polymorphisms) involved in hair pigmentation that controlthe natural color of human hair has been added in Chap. 3. This current Chapterdescribes the response of the red hair pigments to photodegradation which differs fromthat of the brown-black eumelanin. Additional evidence is presented conﬁrming thatboth photochemical and chemical oxidation of 18-methyl eicosanoic acid (covalentlybound lipid on and in the surface) and the disulﬁde bonds at or near the ﬁber surfacelead to increased levels of sulfur acids primarily as sulfonic acid. The resultant effect
creates an acidic, hydrophilic hair surface from a neutral, hydrophobic virgin surface.Hair pigment size and type are highly important to hair color with the largestpigment particles in black hair and the smallest in blonde hair. Age and geo-racialeffects on hair pigmentation are described. Hair pigments, hair dyes, antioxidants andspecialty silicones have all been shown to exhibit some effects on photoprotection.These ﬁndings are described in this Chapter.The composition of amino acid residues in bleached hair and in hydrolysates ofoxidized keratin ﬁbers is described in Chap. 2and also in publications by Zahn [ 1,2],Robbins et al. [ 3–6], Maclaren et al. [ 7,8], and Alter and Bit-Alkis [ 9]. Although,several questions remain unanswered with regard to the structures and reactions ofhair pigments [ 10–14], general features of the chemical structure of hair and itsreactions with bleach products are best described by the language of physical-organic chemistry.
5.2 Hair-Bleaching CompositionsCook [ 15] described hair bleaching compositions several years ago. Completeformulations were listed by Wall in the book edited by Sagarin [ 16]. The mostreliable up-to-date qualitative information on bleaching compositions is found onproduct ingredient labels. From ingredient labels and the information in this Chap-ter, hair bleaching compositions can be formulated. Hydrogen peroxide is theprincipal oxidizing agent used in bleaching compositions, and salts of persulfateare often added as “accelerators” [ 15]. The pH of these products is generally from 9to 11. Stabilizers (e.g., sequestrants) and separate containers are often used to reducethe rate of decomposition of the peroxide and to provide satisfactory shelf life.A maximum hair lightening product for either stripping or frosting hair will
generally consist of three different parts, the hair lightener base (alkalinity), thelotion developer (containing the peroxide) and the booster powder or acceleratorcontaining salts of persulfate. The solution applied to the hair will be prepared justprior to use by mixing approximately 50 g of the lightener base with 100 g of the264 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
lotion developer and two to three packets of the booster powder (approximately10–12 g in each packet).To formulate the hair lightener base of Table 5.1, add the amide, the sulfonateand neodol to the water while stirring at room temperature. Add the oleic acid withstirring and then slowly add the alkalinity followed by sodium sulfate.For the lotion developer of Table 5.2, dissolve the dodecyl benzene sulfonateand nonoxynol-9 in water. Heat to 60/C14C and add the melted cetyl and stearylalcohols while stirring. Cool and add the phosphoric acid and hydrogen peroxide(Table 5.3).For permanent hair dyes even where small shade changes to a lighter color arerequired, bleaching is also involved. For these systems of permanent dyes, extraperoxide is formulated into the creme developer for the necessary bleaching action.For formulas of this type see the section of Chap. 6that describes the formulation ofpermanent hair dyes.
permanent hair dyes.For the spray in the hair lightener of Table 5.4, stir and dissolve the hydroxyethylcetyldimonium phosphate in water followed by polysorbate-20. Then add thequaternium-80, benzoic acid and disodium EDTA followed by the fragrance.Table 5.1 Hair lightenerbaseIngredient PercentageCocodiethanol amide (standamide KD) 9Oleic acid 8Dodecyl benzene sulfonate 7Neodol 91-2.5 6Concentrated ammonium hydroxide 6Sodium sulfate 1Deionized water q.s.Table 5.2 Lotion developerIngredientHydrogen peroxide (30%) 17Dodecyl benzene sulfonate (50%) 16Nonoxynol-9 6Cetyl alcohol 3Stearyl alcohol 2Phosphoric acid 1Water 55Table 5.3 Booster powder(accelerator)Ingredient PercentagePotassium persulfate 27Sodium silicate 26Ammonium persulfate 25Silica 20Sodium lauryl sulfate 1.8Disodium EDTA 0.25.2 Hair-Bleaching Compositions 265
5.3 Reactions of the Proteins of Human Hair with Bleaches5.3.1 Chemical Oxidation of the Disulﬁde BondThe primary purpose in bleaching human hair is to lighten the hair. This goal ismost readily accomplished by oxidation. However, because of the severe reactionconditions required for destruction of the chromophoric groups of hair pigments,side reactions with the hair proteins occur simultaneously. Wolfram [ 12] providedevidence that hydrogen peroxide, the principal component of hair bleach systems,reacts faster with melanin than with hair proteins. However, since hair is primarilyproteinaceous it contains a large percentage of oxidizable groups. For example haircontains thioester bonds at the surface and between cuticle cells. Hair also containsdisulﬁde bonds of the cortical matrix and of the cuticle proteins. Because thesegroups are in the structural proteins of hair, degradation of these proteins alsooccurs during bleaching.
Chemical bleaching with either alkaline peroxide or alkaline peroxide-persulfateﬁrst attacks the thioester groups that bind 18-methyl eicosanoic acid to the surfaceproteins. This reaction partially removes the hydrophobic surface barrier and itcreates sulfur acids (primarily sulfonate groups) on and in the ﬁber surface. Theseactions provide an acidic, hydrophilic hair surface with a lower isoelectric point[6,17–19]. Beard et al. [ 19] have shown that peroxide alone doesn’t oxidize the hairsurface, however peroxide with alkali (as in hair bleach compositions) does, butwith an induction period. This induction period is reduced or even eliminated byinclusion of small amounts of surfactant in the oxidizing medium. The surfactantmost likely removes interfering free lipids from the surface providing access for thenucleophilic hydroperoxide anion to the thioester and disulﬁde linkages for reac-tion. When certain metals such as iron or copper or even persulfate are present free
radical degradation can also occur. These reactions will be described later in thisChapter.Chemical bleaches weaken the cell membrane complex by oxidizing thioesterbetween cuticle cells. Bleaches also oxidize cystine residues of the matrix in thecortex and other hair regions rich in cystine such as the A-layer and the exocuticleinside cuticle cells. These reactions result in breakdown of the cell membraneTable 5.4 Spray in hairlightenerIngredient PercentageWater q.s.Hydrogen peroxide (30%) 10Hydroxyethyl cetyldimonium phosphate 1Polysorbate-20 1Quaternium-80 0.5Benzoic acid 0.3Disodium EDTA 0.2Fragrance 0.2266 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
complex, the cuticle and cortex components and ultimately dissolves proteins inthese regions. The electron micrographs of Figs. 5.1and5.2illustrate the effects offracturing hydrogen peroxide oxidized hair (extensively oxidized) by extending thetreated ﬁbers to break. The cell membrane complex has been weakened by thechemical oxidation as illustrated by the relatively clean breaks between cuticlelayers of Fig. 5.2. This effect is illustrated further by the appearance of a hollowcuticular tube with the cortex largely removed (Fig. 5.1). This consequence suggestsa relatively clean separation at the cuticle–cortex junction in the cuticle–cortex cellmembrane complex. After chemical bleaching there is also a greater tendency forcuticle scale lifting via cell membrane complex failure as illustrated by severalelectron micrographs in Chap. 6.Fig. 5.1 Hair ﬁber oxidized with alkaline peroxide for a few hours and extended to fracture dry.
Much of the cortex has been broken from the interior of the ﬁber leaving a hollow sleeve ofessentially cuticle layers remaining (SEM kindly provided by Sigrid Ruetsch)5.3 Reactions of the Proteins of Human Hair with Bleaches 267
Zahn [ 1] ﬁrst demonstrated that the primary reaction of oxidizing agents with theproteins of human hair occurs at the disulﬁde bond of cystine. Small amounts ofdegradation also occur to the amino acid residues of tyrosine, threonine, andmethionine during severe bleaching [ 5]. The main site of attack, however, is atthe disulﬁde bonds of the cystyl residues in the ﬁbers. Robbins and Kelly [ 5] haveshown that 15–25% of the disulﬁde bonds in human hair are degraded during“normal” bleaching, however, as much as 45% of the cystine bonds may be brokenduring severe “in practice” bleaching. This latter amount of damage may occurwhile frosting hair, or while bleaching hair from black or brown-black to lightblond.The kinetics of the oxidation of cystyl residues in hair by hydrogen peroxide hasnot been reported, although there is evidence to suggest that this reaction is adiffusion-controlled process. Harris and Brown [ 20] reduced and methylated kera-
tin ﬁbers and demonstrated that the wet tensile properties decrease almost linearlywith the disulﬁde content. Alexander et al. [ 21] arrived at this same conclusion afteroxidizing wool ﬁber with peracetic acid. Robbins has observed a similar phenome-non for hair oxidized with alkaline hydrogen peroxide. A portion of these data isdescribed in Chap. 9. Therefore, one may conclude that the percentage loss of thewet tensile properties that occurs during bleaching such as the decrease in the 20%index [ 21] is an estimate of the percentage of cystine linkages that are broken. For amore complete discussion of the effects of bleaching on the tensile properties ofhair, see Chap. 9.Edman and Marti [ 22] described the change in the 20% index of hair ﬁbers as afunction of treatment time in 6% hydrogen peroxide, at 32/C14C using a 25:1solution-to-hair ratio at a pH of 9.5. Their data are plotted in Fig. 5.3vs. the

This diffusion coefﬁcient is of the anticipated magnitude,suggesting that the oxidation of the disulﬁde bond in hair by alkaline hydrogenperoxide is a diffusion-controlled reaction.Two schemes have been proposed for the oxidative degradation of disulﬁde
bonds [ 24,25]: a sulfur to sulfur (S–S) ﬁssion process, and a carbon to sulfur (C–S)ﬁssion process see Fig. 5.4.Fig. 5.3 Rate of cleavage of cystine cross links estimated from tensile properties [ 24] (Reprintedwith permission of the Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists)Fig. 5.4 Schemes for disulﬁde bond ﬁssion [ 24] (Reprinted with permission of the Journal of theSociety of Cosmetic Chemists)5.3 Reactions of the Proteins of Human Hair with Bleaches 269
Table 5.5deﬁnes the different functional groups involved in these two oxidativeschemes. Figure 5.4shows that if the oxidation of cystine in hair proceeds totallythrough S–S ﬁssion, then two moles of sulfonic acid should be produced per mole ofreacted disulﬁde. However, if the reaction goes totally through C–S ﬁssion, thenonly 1 mole of sulfonic acid can be produced from each mole of disulﬁde thatreacts. Nachtigal and Robbins [ 4] have shown that this ratio is greater than 1.6 forfrosted hair, suggesting that this reaction occurs largely through the S–S ﬁssionroute. Secondly, if this reaction occurs through the C–S ﬁssion route, the alcoholproduced would be a seryl residue and on hydrolysis would produce signiﬁcantlylarger quantities of serine in bleached hair hydrolysates than in hydrolysates ofunbleached hair. However, this is not the case because Robbins and Kelly [ 5] have
shown that in samples of hair bleached on heads with commercial bleachingproducts, the amount of serine remaining is equal to or less than that of unbleachedhair. Thus, the oxidative cleavage of the disulﬁde bond that occurs during thechemical bleaching of human hair by current bleach products is predominately anS–S ﬁssion process.Since chemical bleaching of human hair is carried out in an aqueous alkalineoxidizing medium, hydrolysis of the cystine oxide intermediates (Fig. 5.4)s h o u l db ecompetitive with their oxidation. In fact, disproportionation of the cystine oxides [ 22]may also occur, adding to the complexity of the total reaction scheme; however, thenet highest oxidation state of a disulﬁde under S–S ﬁssion conditions is sulfonic acid.This effect is illustrated by the oxidation and hydrolysis reactions of the cystineoxides summarized in Fig. 5.5. Note that disulﬁde trioxides have never been
isolated from oxidized hair. Nevertheless, these species are suggested as “possibleintermediates” since both disulﬁde dioxides and disulﬁde tetroxides of purecompounds [ 25] have been isolated by oxidation in an acidic medium. Cystinemonoxide and dioxide are sensitive to alkaline hydrolysis [ 26,27] but have beenisolated from aqueous acidic oxidations [ 27]. Both the trioxide and tetroxideshould be even more sensitive to alkaline hydrolysis than the monoxide anddioxide [ 25]. Although the importance of hydrolysis relative to oxidation foreach of the cystine oxides is not known, it is certain that hydrolysis will beincreasingly important with increasing pH. At the pH of current bleach products(pH 9–11) the rate of hydrolysis of these species should be competitive withTable 5.5 Functional groupsinvolved in the oxidation ofdisulﬁdes and mercaptansDisulﬁde oxides–S–S– Disulﬁde–SO–S– Monoxide–SO2–S– Dioxide–SO 2–SO– Trioxide–SO 2–SO 2– TetroxideSulfur acids–SH Mercaptan

oxidation, thereby decreasing the probability of existence of these species in majorquantities in bleached hair.Intact hair from bleaching experiments using alkaline hydrogen peroxide andperoxide-persulfate has been examined by both infrared spectroscopy [ 3,9] andelectron spectroscopy for chemical analysis [ 6]. Evidence for intermediate oxidationproducts of cystine (the monoxide through tetroxide) could not be found. However,one cannot conclude that very small quantities of these species do not exist inbleached hair. The primary conclusions from these spectroscopic studies are: (1)the principal end product from the oxidation of cystine during chemical bleaching ofhair with either alkaline peroxide or alkaline peroxide-persulfate is cysteic acid, and(2) the cleavage of cystine proceeds primarily through the S–S ﬁssion route.Zahn and co-workers [ 2], using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, separated up
to 62 isolated protein spots from human hair. From the ﬂuorogram of bleached hair,these scientists identiﬁed cystine oxides (monoxide and dioxide). Although, the exactquantities of these intermediate oxidation products vs. cysteic acid were not reported,the quantities were indicated to be small relative to the cysteic acid content [ 2].To summarize, sulfonic acid is the principal established end product of theoxidative cleavage of the disulﬁde bond from the chemical bleaching of humanhair with current hair bleach products [ 3,9]. The mercaptan content of bleachedhair is lower than that of unbleached hair [ 4]. The intermediate oxidation productsof cystine, that is the disulﬁde monoxide, dioxide, trioxide, and tetroxide do notexist as signiﬁcant end products of hair bleaching using today’s commercial bleachproducts [ 3,6,9]. Nevertheless, evidence has been presented demonstrating lowlevels of cystine oxides in bleached hair [ 2].
levels of cystine oxides in bleached hair [ 2].Considering all the species from the oxidation of disulﬁdes described in Fig. 5.5,the sulﬁnic acid is the only species of even moderate stability [ 28] remaining to beexamined. Sulfenic acids are notoriously unstable [ 29], and disulﬁde trioxides anddisulﬁde tetroxides are even more sensitive to alkali than are the dioxides and themonoxides. Speciﬁc mechanisms for the oxidation of the disulﬁde bond aredescribed in the next section of this Chapter.Fig. 5.5 S–S ﬁssion of disulﬁdes in an aqueous alkaline oxidizing medium [ 24] (Reprinted withpermission of the Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists)5.3 Reactions of the Proteins of Human Hair with Bleaches 271
5.3.2 Proposed Mechanisms for Oxidation of Disulﬁde Bondsby Alkaline PeroxideWhen virtually no metals are present to generate free radicals, the primary mecha-nism for oxidation of the disulﬁde bonds in hair with alkaline hydrogen peroxideoccurs through the monoxide and dioxide primarily via electrophilic oxygen trans-fer and nucleophilic oxygen insertion according to the following pathway throughS–S ﬁssion. A large part of this mechanism was described to me in a privatecommunication by Dr. Jennifer Marsh:A mechanism for oxidation of Disulfide by alkaline peroxide (No metals present)     HOOHElectrophilicOxygen transferR-S-S-R  + HOOH R-S(O)-S-R + H2OR-S(O)-O-S-R + HO-R-S(O)-S(O)-R + HO-R-S-O-SR + HO–HOO-      NucleophilicOxygen insertionHOO-    NucleophilicOxygen insertionR-SO2SR [R-S(O)O* + *S-R] R-S(O)-O-S-RRadical Rearrangement[R-S(O)*   *(O)-S-R]R-S-O* + *SRR-S(O)-S(O)-RHOO-   NucleophilicOxygen InsertionHOO-   Nucleophilic       Oxygen     Insertion

When metals like iron II or copper I are present hydrogen peroxide can reactwith these to form free radicals by Fenton’s reaction (below) and the oxidationmechanism follows a different pathway but still lead to sulfonate via the S–S ﬁssionpathway as summarized below:Mechanism for the oxidation of disulfide by alkaline peroxide with Metals (Fe++ or Cu+)H2O2   +   M      =    HO     +   HO      (Fenton Reaction)HO.+ →.R-S -S+(OH)-R  (Cation radical)     .R-S -S+(OH)-RR-S-OO   O+ O2.-+  O2.-→ R-S   S-R   →2 R-S-O..→. -R-S-S-RR-SO3–Marsh et al. [ 30] described the formation of the hydroxyl and perhydroxylradicals and molecular oxygen that result in hair by the decomposition of alkalinehydrogen peroxide in the presence of transition metal ions like iron and copper.
These free radicals induce formation of cysteic acid from disulﬁde in the F-layer,and other regions of the ﬁber during the oxidation dye process when transitionmetals like copper or iron are present. However, Marsh et al. [ 30] demonstrated thatthe inclusion of certain chelants into oxidation dye formulations can inhibit orreduce the formation of cysteic acid at or near the hair ﬁber surface. These effectsare explained by the chelants binding low levels of copper known to be in some tapwaters. This action by chelants (in alkaline peroxide) inhibits the known metalinduced free radical formation and the resultant formation of sulfonate by theoxidation of disulﬁde at or near the ﬁber surface. See Chap. 2for a description oftrace metals found in human hair.5.3.3 Oxidation of Other Amino Acid ResiduesRobbins and Kelly [ 5] have examined bleached and unaltered hair by hydrolysisand amino acid analysis. Their results for severely bleached hair are summarized in
Table 5.6and suggest that methionine, tyrosine, lysine, and histidine, in addition tocystine, are degraded to the greatest extent (tryptophan could not be evaluated inthis study).These results are consistent with the relative sensitivities of these species tooxidation. Cystine and its reactions with oxidizing agents have already beendescribed. Methionine is also sensitive to oxidation and is probably oxidized to5.3 Reactions of the Proteins of Human Hair with Bleaches 273
its sulfoxide and possibly to methionine sulfone. Tyrosine, with its electron-richphenolic ring, is also sensitive to oxidation. The amine salts of lysine and histidineshould be resistant to oxidation, although the free amines of these species may beslowly oxidized in the bleach medium.5.3.4 Hydrolysis or the Action of AlkalinitySince bleaching compositions are usually formulated between pH 9 and 11, thehydrolysis of peptide and amide bonds and the formation of lanthionyl residues inhair are possible side reactions during bleaching. The hydrolysis of amide groups ofthe residues of aspartic and glutamic acids, in addition to the formation of cysteicacid residues, will increase the ratio of acidic to basic groups in the ﬁbers; i.e.,amide hydrolysis will decrease the isoelectric and isoionic points of the ﬁbers.O O-C-CH-NH- -C-CH-NH-CH2NH2NH3CH2C=O C=O -OHO-+Amide of aspartic acid residuePeptide bonds are the major repeating structural unit of polypeptides and proteins.
Hydrolysis of peptide bonds can occur at high pH and is most likely to occur duringfrosting or bleaching from black or brown-black to light blond, where long reactiontimes and higher concentrations of alkalinity and oxidizing agent are employed.HTable 5.6 The effect ofbleaching on the amino acidresidues in hair [ 5]Amino acid Micromoles/g dry hairNonfrosted Frosted % DifferenceaHalf-cystine 1,509 731 /C050Methionine 50 38 /C024Tyrosine 183 146 /C020Lysine 198 180 /C010Histidine 65 55 /C015aOnly those amino acids found to be 10% or lower in bleachedhair are included in this table274 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
Harris and Brown [ 20] have shown that the wet tensile properties of keratinﬁbers are related to the disulﬁde bonds, whereas the dry tensile properties areinﬂuenced more by peptide bond cleavage [ 21]. In an examination of frosted hair,Robbins found a 4–8% decrease in the dry tensile properties (see Chap. 9fordetails). This suggests that some peptide bond hydrolysis occurs during severebleaching conditions. Note that the frequency of peptide bonds is nearly an orderof magnitude greater than that of the disulﬁde bonds in human hair.The formation of lanthionyl residues in alkaline media is described in Chap. 4.Note that if lanthionine is formed during hair bleaching, its sulfoxide and sulfoneare also possible oxidation products.5.3.5 Summary of Chemical Bleaching of Hair Proteinsby PeroxideWhen hair is exposed to chemical bleaching, changes occur in the surface layers
removing some of the 18-methyl eicosanoic acid. Free lipids at the surface andbetween scales are removed or oxidized. The reaction with 18-MEA results in theformation of acidic sulfur compounds such as mercaptan, sulﬁnate and sulfonategroups (predominately sulfonate for chemically bleached hair). A decrease in thefree lipid content in the surface layers also results which with removal of 18-MEAprovides a dry feel to the hair. These changes convert the virgin hair ﬁber andespecially the surface from a hydrophobic, entity with little surface charge to amore hydrophilic, more polar and more negatively charged surface; see Chap. 6for
additional details. In addition, cystine degradation occurs in the cystine rich A-layerand the exocuticle of the cuticle. Tensile data clearly shows that cystine degradationoccurs in the matrix and intermediate ﬁlaments of the cortex too. In addition,methionine, tyrosine, histidine and lysine are modiﬁed by oxidation and some ofthe peptide and amide groups are hydrolyzed by alkaline degradation.5.4 Oxidation of Hair Proteins and the Cell MembraneComplex by Sun and UV LightLight radiation attacks hair proteins of the cuticle and the cortex, in addition to thecell membrane complex lipids (attached to the cell membrane proteins) and the hairpigments. The emphasis in this section is on the photochemical degradation of theproteins and lipoproteins of hair with special emphasis on the cell membranecomplex lipids and proteins. Later in this chapter, in the discussion on hairpigments, the effects of light radiation on melanins are considered.
Unfortunately, many of the published manuscripts dealing with photochemicaldegradation employ different units of radiation or widely varying exposures making5.4 Oxidation of Hair Proteins and the Cell Membrane Complex 275
comparisons difﬁcult. Signori [ 31] suggested that comparisons be made in terms oftotal irradiation energy using units of J m/C02month/C01(Joules per meter squared permonth). A typical Florida Month of exposure provides 295 /C2106Jm/C02month/C01of UV plus visible light and 25 /C2106Jm/C02month/C01of UV light. Many photo-chemical treatments of hair in the literature are well beyond this level of exposure.However, 1–4 Florida months of exposure appears to be a reasonable high level ofexposure that might occur on the hair of Florida sunbathers.The covalently bound lipids of the CMC of the cuticle are sensitive to oxidation,reduction and to alcoholic alkalinity while the lipid Beta layers of the cortex areaffected more by lipid solvents and free radical chemistry. For example, the Betalayers of the cuticle are more sensitive to nucleophilic attack by species such as thehydroperoxide anion and mercaptans, but the Beta layers of the cortex with their
multiplicity of double bonds (oleic plus palmitoleic acids, plus cholesterol andcholesterol sulfate) and tertiary hydrogen atoms (cholesterol and cholesterol sul-fate) are more sensitive to free radical chemistry. On the other hand, the membranesof the CMC are resistant to oxidizing and reducing agents [ 32]. Several of thesechemical actions make the CMC more vulnerable to fracture, to cuticle fragmenta-tion and to the propagation of cracks through the cortex leading to split hairs.There is evidence that an appreciable amount of free-lipid (not covalently boundto hair proteins) is in the Beta layers of the cuticle and likely in all lipid layers ofkeratin ﬁbers [ 33]. Furthermore, about 50% of free-lipid in human hair is fatty acidand free lipid provides acidic groups to the hair surface and decreases the isoelectricpoint as shown by Capablanca and Watt [ 34] for wool ﬁber. As hair is exposed to
repeated shampooing, blow drying, rubbing and to sunlight, changes occur on andin the surface layers. These changes involve removal of some free lipids byshampoos, photo-degradation of 18-MEA, disulﬁde and other functional groups.Consequently, the ﬁber so weakened can form fractures in or between layers fromsevere bending, stretching and abrasive actions during combing and/or brushing.These actions expose “new” protein material and sulfur acids primarily sulfonategroups with an accompanying decrease in the free and bound lipid content of thehair surface. In that manner, the virgin hair surface is converted from a hydrophobicentity with little surface charge to a hydrophilic, polar and negatively chargedsurface. The more exposure of the hair to chemical and abrasive actions, such asthe further from the root ends the more hydrophilic, more polar and more negativelycharged the surface becomes.5.4.1 Damage by Shampoos and Conditioners and Irradiation
The dissolution or the removal of structural lipids or proteinaceous matter fromhair, primarily from the CMC or endocuticle, by shaking keratin ﬁbers either insurfactant or shampoo solutions or even water has been demonstrated by severaldifferent scientists. For example, Marshall and Ley [ 35] demonstrated the extrac-tion of proteinaceous components from the cuticle of wool ﬁber by shaking it in276 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
sodium dodecyl sulfate solution, a common surfactant in many shampoos. Gouldand Sneath [ 36] examined root and tip end sections of scalp hair by TEM andobserved holes or vacancies in thin cross-sections of the hair. This hair had neverbeen chemically treated. These holes were more frequent and larger in tip ends thanin root ends. These scientists attributed these holes to damaging effects byshampooing and weathering involving the breakdown and removal of the non-keratin portions (CMC and endocuticle) of the hair leaving the intercellular regionsmore susceptible to fracture under stress. It is likely that sun exposure helped tomake the hair more vulnerable to the actions of shampoos; however sunlight effectswere not examined in this study.Beta-delta failure [ 37] is one of the most common types of fractures in hairﬁbers. This fracture occurs in the cuticle–cuticle CMC between the upper Beta layerand the adjoining Delta layer (see Fig. 6.31) and it occurs most readily when the
ﬁber is dry. Gamez-Garcia [ 38] noted that the lower the relative humidity or themoisture content of hair, the lower the strain level required to produce Beta-deltafailure.Beta-delta failure was observed by Negri et al. [ 37] on wool ﬁber who noteddisruption of the cuticle–cuticle CMC along the upper Beta layer in TEM sections.With this type of fracture, the Delta layer and the lower Beta layer are both retainedon the underside of the “old” outermost cuticle cell. As a result 18-MEA is left asthe “new” hair surface once the “old” outermost cuticle cell is abraded away. Thistype of fragmentation has been described in detail by Feughelman and Willis [ 39]
who proposed that the failure of adhesion between overlapping scales involves18-MEA. Furthermore, the chain branch in 18-MEA provides mobility and areduction in adhesion between scales leading to Beta-delta failure. Therefore,chemical degradation of 18-MEA, both on the surface and between scales leadsto further weakening of this structure and more rapid Beta-delta failure leading tofaster cuticle fragmentation and cuticle loss. Ruetsch and Kamath [ 17] have shownthat 18-MEA is degraded by chemical and photochemical bleaching. Ruetsch et al.[40] has shown that it is degraded by alkalinity and Robbins [ 41] has shown that it isdegraded by permanent wave treatments.5.4.2 Wet Versus Dry State Failure and Oxidative ExposureDeformations such as stretching as shown by Robbins [ 42] and by Kamath andWeigmann [ 43] (including extension cycling by Gamez-Garcia [ 38]), bending as ina snag or a knot [ 42,44] or twisting in the wet state are very different than
deformations in the dry state. This is because failure in the wet state generallyinvolves fractures or breaking bonds in hydrophilic layers, such as the endocuticleor the central contact zone of the CMC. In contrast, failure in the dry state generallyinvolves fractures in or between hydrophobic layers, e.g., Beta-delta failure [ 39,42].Failure in the wet state generally involves hydrophilic regions because when a layeror region is completely swollen less mechanical stress is required to distort that layer5.4 Oxidation of Hair Proteins and the Cell Membrane Complex 277
and to produce a fracture. At low relative humidity or swelling condition of ahydrophilic layer, more mechanical stress is required to distort it relative to hydro-phobic layers and therefore fractures are generally produced in hydrophobic layers.Extension of undamaged hair to break generally produces smooth fractures [ 44].However, as the hair becomes more damaged or as the relative humidity isdecreased and especially at lower humidity more step fractures are produced [ 43].Step fractures involve extensive fracturing in the cortex–cortex CMC, most likelyin the lipid or Beta layers. Kamath and Weigmann [ 43] demonstrated at lowmoisture content, crack initiation occurs most often in the cortex. However, athigh moisture content, fractures almost always initiate at or near the ﬁber surfacebecause of the high pressure of the swollen cortex against the cuticle.Step fractures involve the axial propagation of cracks either through the
cortex–cortex CMC (see Fig. 1.45) or the medulla [ 43] and because these regionsare hydrophobic they tend to occur more frequently in the dry state than when hairﬁbers are wet [ 43]. Kamath and Weigmann [ 43] also concluded that, the CMCseems to “play an important role in stress transfer and axial splitting” of human hairﬁbers.The abrasion resistance of human hair is decreased by most chemical treatmentsincluding photo-oxidation as shown by the “Protein loss” test of Sandhu andRobbins [ 45] or by the release of labile and eluted proteins as described by Inoueet al. [ 46]. These tests are both wet state methods. The interior of cortical cells is
degraded by alkaline peroxide, thereby weakening the cuticle and cortex cellsinternally. Alkaline peroxide degrades the cuticle–cuticle CMC weakening thecellular cohesion or the resistance of scales to break apart. Cuticle fragmentationin the dry state is caused primarily by the rupture between cuticle cells throughBeta-delta failure [ 38,39] and the resultant chipping of cuticle from the hair viaabrasive actions. Cuticle loss in the wet state is primarily caused by rupturing ofcuticle cells internally and is greater in chemically damaged hair such as alkalineperoxide treated, permanent waved or irradiated hair than in chemically untreatedhair. This type of cuticle loss is due to the decrease in disulﬁde crosslinks and anincrease in hydrophilic sulfonate groups [ 45].Fatigue testing a method developed at TRI-Princeton by Ruetsch, Kamath and
Weigmann (involves attaching a weight to a hair and dropping the weight multipletimes to continuously shock or jar the ﬁber) shows that alkaline peroxide treatmentof human hair ﬁbers when fatigued produces numerous scale edge fractures withscale edge chipping. Ruetsch [ 47] fatigue tested peroxide treated hair in the drystate followed by stretching and found extensive fracturing in the CMC between thescales due to a weakened cuticle–cuticle CMC by oxidative treatments, chemical orsimulated sunlight. This effect is most likely due to oxidative attack on thioesterlinkages that disrupts the Beta layers of the cuticle–cuticle CMC.Takahashi et al. [ 48] provided evidence that wet cuticle wear in Asian hair is duemore to CMC failure (possibly involving the central hydrophilic “contact zone” ofthe Delta layer) rather than failure inside cuticle cells as in Caucasian hair (mostlikely endocuticular failure). Takahashi et al. [ 48] showed that wet cuticle wear on
Asian hair occurs at a faster rate than on Caucasian hair. This increased wet cuticle278 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
wear is because of differences between Asian and Caucasian hair in the elasticity ofthe different layers inside cuticle scales. Takahashi et al. showed that the scales ofAsian hair are removed faster by wet sonication after extension to 35% or bybleaching the hair followed by shampooing and wet combing the hair over alarge number of cycles. In the latter case after 90 grooming strokes for four cyclesfewer scales were found on Asian hair relative to Caucasian hair (1.3 vs. 3.2 scalesrespectively).On further examination of the hair using an Atomic Force Microscopic probethese scientists found a greater difference in elasticity as a function of depth for theCaucasian vs. Asian hair (1.41 vs. 1.26). Therefore, Takahashi et al. concluded thatthe scales of Asian hair are removed more by fracturing in the cuticle–cuticle CMC(even in the wet state) while the scales of Caucasian hair fractures inside the scales
most likely in the swollen endocuticle. It is interesting to note here that Nakamura[49] by staining reactions has concluded that the composition of the proteins of theDelta layer of the cuticle–cuticle CMC is very much like that of the very hydro-philic endocuticle.5.4.3 CMC Lipids Degraded by Both UV and Visible LightHoting and Zimmerman [ 50] studied radiation damage to hair as a function ofwavelength and determined that the CMC lipids of hair ﬁbers are degraded most byvisible light, but also by UV-A and UV-B light. These results help to explain theweakened CMC (of cuticle and cortex) and the multiple step fractures that resultfrom the axial propagation of cracks through the cortex–cortex CMC in sunlightoxidized hair. Furthermore, Hoting and Zimmermann demonstrated that cystine,proline and valine are degraded more in light brown hair than in black hairconﬁrming that the photo-protective effect by hair pigments is stronger in darkhair than in light hair.
Korner et al. concluded that one weak link to photo-chemical attack on lipidstructures in the cuticle CMC are the tertiary hydrogen atoms of 18-MEA [ 51].Cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate also contain tertiary hydrogen atoms and shouldprovide sites for hydrogen abstraction in photo-chemical reactions. In addition, theallylic hydrogen atoms of oleic and palmitoleic acids and of cholesterol andcholesterol sulfate in the cortex–cortex CMC are especially vulnerable to photo-oxidative reactions as described later in this Chapter.Long term irradiation does not provide for clean breaks between structuralcomponents of human hair as was observed for peroxide oxidized hair. However,long term radiation leads to cross-linking or fusion reactions similar to long termradiation on wool ﬁber as explained in the next section of this Chapter. For hairdamaged by sunlight, in some cases, the lipids of the cuticle CMC appear altered to
a greater extent than the more susceptible areas of the cortex CMC because theouter layers of the ﬁber receive higher intensities of radiation.5.4 Oxidation of Hair Proteins and the Cell Membrane Complex 279
5.4.4 Short Term Irradiation Attacks CMC Lipids ProducingInternal Step FracturesFracturing of wool ﬁber exposed to simulated sunlight has been studied microscop-ically by Zimmermann and Hocker [ 52]. Electron micrographs of human hair ﬁbersexposed to simulated sunlight and then fractured were provided to this author bySigrid Ruetsch showing that human hair provides similar effects to wool ﬁber.Zimmerman and Hocker demonstrated that stretching non-irradiated control woolﬁbers in water provided primarily smooth fractures, while short and intermediatetimes of simulated sunlight exposure caused the ﬁbers to break mainly as stepfractures. These scientists suggested that short and intermediate-term irradiationdamages the lipids of the CMC (all three types of CMC) and thereby provides manyinternal step type fractures by axial propagation of cracks through the photo-chemically damaged cortex CMC.5.4.5 Long Term Irradiation Produces Fusion ReactionsAcross Structural Boundaries
Across Structural BoundariesLonger term irradiation creates cross-links in the ﬁbers fusing the hair acrossstructural boundaries creating amorphous fractures. Cracks do not occur betweenstructural boundaries as in less damaged hair, but clean smooth fractures acrosscuticle and outer cortex boundaries see Figs. 5.6,5.7,5.8and5.9. Figures 5.10,5.11and5.12 show the effects of ultraviolet exposure followed by reaction with alkalinehydrogen peroxide for different times (15 min to 2 h). The effects of alkalineFig. 5.6 Hair ﬁber exposed to ultraviolet radiation and extended to break dry (SEM was taken atthe fracture site and kindly provided by Sigrid Ruetsch)280 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
peroxide on hair after long term exposure to ultraviolet are to fuse and then dissolveparts of the cuticle providing for even less structural differentiation. Part of thecuticular proteins are solubilized by these combined chemical treatments intogelatin-like glue that is re-deposited between the ﬁbers, see Fig. 5.11. This effectwas produced after only 15 min exposure to alkaline peroxide after long termphotochemical degradation. The total lack of surface structural deﬁnition is seenFig. 5.7 Another hair ﬁber exposed to ultraviolet radiation and extended to break. SEM’s weretaken at the fracture site.

in the most extreme case in Fig. 5.12 where no cuticle scale deﬁnition exists afterlong time ultraviolet exposure and 2 h with alkaline peroxide. This lack of scaledeﬁnition is probably due to the combined dissolution of the cuticle and the re-deposition of proteinaceous material onto the surface, thereby, masking the scalesas occurs in the peracid treatment described later in this Chapter.Zimmermann and Hocker [ 52] demonstrated that short and intermediate termradiation attacks CMC lipids providing for increased Beta-delta failure in thecuticle–cuticle CMC and multiple step fractures in the cortex CMC. Longer termirradiation produces amorphous fractures by fusion reactions through the creationof carbonyl groups that are cross-linked through lysine, analogous to the oxidativedamage to proteins and mitochondrial decay associated with aging described byFig. 5.9 High magniﬁcation view of the cortex of the UV exposed-fractured ﬁber of Fig. 5.6. Note

Dean et al. [ 53]. These fusion reactions start in the periphery of the ﬁber where itreceives higher intensities of radiation than the core, providing a smooth fracture atthe periphery and multiple step fractures in the interior of the ﬁbers (Figs. 5.7and5.8). If the ﬁbers are exposed long enough to light radiation, amorphous fracturesare produced across the entire ﬁber.Short and intermediate term exposures to radiation are propagated by abstractionof hydrogen atoms from tertiary carbon atoms of 18-MEA [ 51] and of allylichydrogen atoms of oleic and palmitoleic acids in lipids of the cuticle CMC. Thecortex-CMC contains tertiary hydrogen atoms on cholesterol and cholesterol sulfateand allylic hydrogen atoms on oleic and palmitoleic acids, and on cholesterol andFig. 5.11 Hair ﬁbers exposed to ultraviolet light and then bleached with alkaline peroxide for 4 h.Note the decreased scale differentiation and the apparent “glueing” together of the ﬁbers by the

cholesterol sulfate that react similarly. The abstraction of hydrogen atoms fromtertiary carbon atoms on amino acid side chains (analogous to the tertiary carbonatoms on 18-MEA and cholesterols) has been shown by Goshe et al. [ 54]t opredominate over the abstraction of hydrogen atoms at the alpha carbon atom ofamino acids in poly-peptides. However, the abstraction of hydrogen atoms at allylicpositions should be even faster.H H HO-CH-C=C- >> >> CH3-C-CH2- NH-C-C-NH-R RAllylic Tertiar y hydrogen atom Tertiar y hydrogen at α-carbonThese facts help to explain why the Beta layers are degraded faster by photo-oxidation than the hair proteins. Photochemical reactions in the Beta layers onallylic groups are very fast and lead to axial failure including splitting. However,photochemical reactions in the proteins are slower leading to cross-linking (fusionreactions) and amorphous fractures.R Ruv-light-CH-CO-NH-CH-CO-NH- R-CO-CO-NH-R’-C-CO-NH2+Alpha keto derivative (carbonyl)HAmide
Alpha keto derivative (carbonyl)HAmideRupture of peptide bonds b y uv lightOxidation at the peptide backbone carbon has been shown to occur fromultraviolet exposure both in wool [ 55] and in hair [ 6], producing carbonyl groups(alpha keto acid/amide) and amide groups. Ultimately these reactions can lead tonew cross-links as described in the equations below. The formation of carbonylgroups is favored in the dry state reaction more than the wet state. This reaction hasbeen documented using infrared spectroscopy by Robbins [ 3] and Dubief [ 18].Figures 5.6,5.7,5.8and5.9(described earlier) illustrate hair ﬁbers exposed
extensively to simulated sunlight and extended to break. These SEM’s show thatlong term ultraviolet exposure causes severe chemical degradation to the hairproteins. As indicated above, the damage is so extensive that structural differentia-tion is diminished. This physicochemical degradation usually occurs at a higherlevel in the hair ﬁber periphery with a gradient to a lower level of oxidative damagedeeper into the ﬁber. Such damage leads to unusual fracture patterns duringextension, see Figs. 5.7,5.8and5.9.

structural units decreases structural deﬁnition. These reactions collectively leadto a fusion of different structures and a gradual increase in brittleness accompaniedby a loss of structural differentiation as shown in these photomicrographs (Figs. 5.7,5.8and5.9).HR-CO-CO-NH-R-C-CO-NH-N-H Carbonyl group +   H2OCH2 +      NH2-CO-CH-NH-(CH2)4 new cross-link-CO-CH-NH-lysine residueFormation of cross-links from rupture of peptide bonds by uv lightSubsequent exposure to aqueous alkaline solution or to alkaline peroxidesolutions leads to rapid dissolution of the affected areas (Figs. 5.10 and5.11).Longer exposure of these ultraviolet radiated ﬁbers with oxidizing solutions leadsto dissolution/ elimination of scale differentiation and dissolution of the melaningranules, see Fig. 5.12.5.4.6 Fusion Reactions at Peptide Bonds from Free Radicalsat Alpha Carbon AtomsThe fusion reactions of wool and human hair (described above) are believed to be
related to the oxidative damage of proteins and mitochondrial decay associated withaging described by Dean et al. [ 53] and are believed to involve the abstraction of ahydrogen atom from the alpha carbon of an amino acid residue in a protein chain ina keratin ﬁber [ 56] which can then either add oxygen to form a hydroperoxide orlose hydrogen to form a dehydropeptide. Meybeck and Meybeck [ 56] concludedthat either route forms an alpha-keto acid (carbonyl group) after hydrolysis. Thiseffect results by cleaving the protein chain to form the alpha-keto acid and aprimary amide. The alpha-keto acid then reacts with a lysine residue to form anew amide cross-link in the ﬁbers and thus the fusion reaction is completed.Carbonyl groups have been shown to be formed by irradiation of wool withsimulated sunlight and this reaction is related to photoyellowing of keratin ﬁbers.Holt and Milligan [ 55] identiﬁed keto acids (carbonyl groups) in irradiated wool byreductive amination with sodium
reductive amination with sodium3H-borohydride in ammonia. This reactionconverts keto acids to the corresponding3H-amino acids. By this type of labeling,Holt and Milligan demonstrated that by irradiating wool, carbonyl groups areformed from alanine, glycine, proline, serine, threonine, glutamic acid and tyrosine.Therefore, free radicals were formed from these amino acids by hydrogen atomabstraction at the alpha carbon atom.5.4 Oxidation of Hair Proteins and the Cell Membrane Complex 285
However, as indicated earlier, the fusion reactions are slower than the other freeradical reactions involving hydrogen atom abstraction, because the abstraction ofhydrogen atoms from tertiary carbon atoms of side chains of amino acid residueshas been shown to be prevalent over the abstraction of hydrogen atoms alpha to thepeptide function [ 54] and the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from an allylic groupis even faster. Furthermore, the consequences of the fusion reactions appear onlyafter the most intense and longest radiation times on wool ﬁber as shown byZimmermann and Hocker [ 52].5.4.7 Photoprotection by an Oxidation DyeHoting and Zimmermann [ 50] demonstrated that the CMC lipids of the cortex of
hair, previously bleached with peroxide-persulfate, are more readily degraded byradiation than the lipids of chemically unaltered hair or the lipids of hair dyed with ared oxidation dye. This conclusion was reached by analysis of the cholesterolcontaining lipids of hair which reside primarily in the cortex CMC. Peroxide-persulfate oxidation of hair is primarily a free radical oxidative process and itleaves hydroperoxide groups in the hair in the CMC and in other regions.Thus the action of sunlight on peroxide-persulfate bleached hair (containing
hydroperoxides) makes the hair more vulnerable to cuticle fragmentation and tosplitting that the CMC plays a signiﬁcant role in. In this same paper these scientistsdemonstrated that one red oxidation dye provides photo-protection to both UV-Aand visible light but not to UV-B light. Hair when treated with this red dye whencompared to chemically untreated hair retards the degradation of the CMC lipidsmost likely by the dye acting as a radical scavenger.5.4.8 Other Physical Effects from Photochemical Reactionswith HairBeyak [ 57] and Dubief [ 18] demonstrated that sunlight and ultraviolet lightdecrease the wet tensile properties of human hair. Beyak related these effects tothe total radiation that the hair is exposed to, rather than to any speciﬁc wavelength.However, more recently, hair protein degradation by light radiation has been shownto occur primarily in the wavelength region of 254–400 nm. Hair proteins have been
shown by Arnaud et al. [ 58] to absorb light primarily between 254 and 350 nm.Dubief also determined that swelling of photochemically damaged hair isincreased relative to undamaged control hair. This effect was demonstrated byboth the alkali solubility test [ 18,59] and by swelling in sodium hydroxide [ 18].Several amino acids of hair absorb light in this region (254–350 nm). Therefore,these amino acids are the most subject to degradation by light. The following amino286 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
acids have been shown to be degraded by weathering actions (primarily lightradiation) on wool ﬁber by Launer [ 60] and by Inglis and Lennox [ 61]; cystineand methionine (two sulfur-containing amino acids); the aromatic and ring aminoacids—phenylalanine and tryptophan (often associated with photo-yellowing ofwool), histidine, and proline; and the aliphatic amino acid leucine.Pande and Jachowicz [ 62] used ﬂuorescence spectroscopy to monitor the decom-position of tryptophan in hair. These scientists demonstrated that photodegradationof tryptophan occurs in hair. In addition, they speculated that photodamage totryptophan can increase the sensitivity of other amino acids to photodegradationas explained in the section of this Chapter entitled, Mechanisms for photochemicalreactions in human hair .5.4.9 Other Photochemical Reactions with Hair FibersRobbins and Kelly [ 63] analyzed amino acids of both proximal and distal ends of
human hair and demonstrated signiﬁcantly more cysteic acid in tip ends. Theyattribute this change to weathering actions, speciﬁcally to ultraviolet radiationattack on disulﬁde and thioester bonds. This same study also found signiﬁcantdecreases in tip ends for tyrosine and histidine similar to the weathering effects inwool ﬁber. Decreases were also reported in the lysine content in this study on hairweathering. This effect could be from the cross-linking reaction of lysine withcarbonyl groups formed by ultraviolet attack on peptide bonds (described above).Robbins and Bahl [ 6] examined the effects of sunlight and ultraviolet radiation ondisulﬁde sulfur in hair via electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) [ 6].
Both UV-A (320–400 nm) and UV-B (290–320 nm) radiation were shown to oxidizesulfur in hair. The primary oxidation occurs closer to the hair ﬁber surface, probablyfrom attack on thioester and disulﬁde, producing a steep gradient of oxidized to lessoxidized hair from the outer circumference of the hair to the ﬁber core.The ESCA binding energy spectra (S 2p sulfur) for weathered hair and hairexposed to an ultraviolet lamp in the laboratory are similar but differ from spectraof chemically bleached hair (alkaline hydrogen peroxide). Similar binding energiessuggest similar end products and similar mechanisms of oxidation. As describedearlier in this chapter, the mechanism for peroxide oxidation of pure disulﬁdes andfor disulﬁde residues in hair is believed to proceed through the S–S ﬁssion route. Onthe other hand, for irradiation of pure cystine, existing evidence by Savige andMaclaren [ 25] suggests the C–S ﬁssion route as the preferred route for photochemi-
cal degradation of cystine and for other pure disulﬁdes (see Fig. 5.4). For thephotochemical reaction, if the pH is neutral or alkaline, then the C–S ﬁssion routeis the preferred one; however, if the pH is acidic, then the homolytic or S–S ﬁssionroute is more likely to occur.The evidence from ESCA suggests that both the chemical and the photochemicaldegradation of cystine in hair are similar to that of pure disulﬁdes [ 6], that is, forchemical degradation, S–S ﬁssion occurs, while for photochemical degradation the,5.4 Oxidation of Hair Proteins and the Cell Membrane Complex 287
C–S ﬁssion route is the preferred route. For the S–S ﬁssion route, the main endproduct is sulfonic acid. For the C–S ﬁssion route, the main products are theS-sulfonic and sulfonic acids [ 25]. However, ultimately, S-sulfonic acid is degradedby light to sulfonic acid [ 25]. The ESCA spectra suggest that cystine S-sulfonateand cysteic acid are both formed in weathered (tip) ends of hair and in hair exposedto ultraviolet light. But, cysteic acid is the primary end product formed from theoxidation of cystine in hair during chemical bleaching [ 6]. These results suggestthat the mechanism for the radiation-induced degradation of cystine occurs throughthe C–S ﬁssion pathway and is different from the chemical oxidation of cystine thatproceeds mainly via the S–S ﬁssion route.Tolgyesi [ 64] and Ratnapandian et al. [ 65] proposed a homolytic scission of thedisulﬁde bond by sunlight; however this mechanism ignores the resultant end
products of the reaction. It is likely that the photochemical reaction is not asclean as that of the chemical route. Therefore, both pathways are possible andlikely to occur when the reaction is photochemically induced. Nevertheless, theformation of cystine S-sulfonic acid cannot be explained by the homolytic scissionof the disulﬁde bond alone. Mechanisms for both hemolytic scission and C–Sscission will be described in the next sections of this Chapter.5.4.10 Summary of Sunlight Oxidation of Hair ProteinsAs hair is exposed to sunlight changes occur by removal of 18-MEA at the surfaceand between scales by the free radical oxidation of sulfur compounds formingmercaptan, sulﬁnate and sulfonate groups (primarily sulfonate) and a decrease inthe free lipid content in the surface layers. These changes convert the virgin hairsurface from a hydrophobic, entity with little surface charge to a more hydrophilic,more polar and more negatively charged surface; see Chap. 6for additional details.
Cystine degradation occurs inside cuticle cells in the cystine rich A-layer and theexocuticle of the cuticle and in cortical cells because tensile results show thatcystine degradation occurs in the matrix of the cortex too and likely in theIntermediate Filaments too; however the strongest effects are in the uppermostsurface layers [ 6]. Cystine and tryptophan, methionine, tyrosine, histidine andlysine are also modiﬁed by oxidation. With long term or extensive sunlight expo-sure, peptide bonds are degraded by sunlight forming new cross-links which ﬁrstoccurs in the cuticle layers and ultimately in the cortex.5.5 Mechanisms for Free Radical Reactions in Human HairKirschenbaum et al. [ 66] provided evidence from photo-irradiation of human hairunder UVA and visible light for the formation of the hydroxyl free radical. Theirresults showed that bleached and red hair provide a greater yield of hydroxyl288 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
radicals than brown hair. This latter effect is due to the fact that there is moreeumelanin in brown than bleached and red hair and it is a more effective radicalscavenger than pheomelanin.Millington [ 67] in a review on photoyellowing of wool describes the formationof hydroxyl radicals, oxygen radicals, superoxide and hydroperoxides as being thespecies that drive photoyellowing reactions. Millington described the generation ofhydroxyl radicals in several schemes as in the initial photo-chemical excitation of aphoto-chemical absorber or radical initiator such as melanin [ 67–69] pheomelaninor tryptophan [ 66,67].Initiator þhv!Initiator/C3Initiator/C3denotes excited state fgThe second step is the formation of free radicals from the excited state of theinitiator.Initiator/C3!B/C15þC/C15The next step involves abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the keratin ﬁber toform a free radical on the hair or wool keratin.B/C15þKeratin-H !Keratin/C15þB- H

In this scheme, achromophore such as melanin or Tryptophan can absorb light and be elevated to anexcited state.Chrþhv!Chr/C35.5 Mechanisms for Free Radical Reactions in Human Hair 289
The excited chromophore can then react with molecular oxygen to form super-oxide anion radical.Chr/C3þO2!Chrþ/C15þO2/C0/C15Dismutation of superoxide then occurs to hydrogen peroxide and molecularoxygen.2O2/C0/C15þ2Hþ!H2O2þO2Hydrogen peroxide can then react with either a transition metal (Fenton reaction;primarily ferrous or cuprous ion) or by photolysis to form hydroxyl radicals. In thecase of hydrogen peroxide oxidation of hair, H 2O2is already present, and if Cu orFe is present, then the Fenton reaction (below) can occur to produce hydroxylradicals.H2O2þhv!2HO/C15H2O2þMetal !HO/C15þOH/C0þMetalþ1Millington proposed these schemes to provide hydroxyl radicals, hydroperoxidesand oxygen radicals that he felt were important to the yellowing mechanism of woolﬁber. Hydrogen peroxide can also be generated during the photo-degradation ofTryptophan which can then generate hydroxyl radicals by either reacting with trace
metals or by photolysis. These reactions involving hydrogen peroxide or keratinhydroperoxides, especially with metals such as Cu or Fe, are very relevant to thereaction of alkaline hydrogen peroxide with human hair during bleaching or oxida-tive dyeing.Millington discussed different photo-yellowing mechanisms and concluded thatthe evidence supports that the yellowing of wool ﬁber is caused by the photo-oxidation of several species and not just the photo-oxidation of tryptophan toN-formyl kynurenine to kynurenine and ﬁnally to 3-hydroxy kyneureine that hasbeen shown to occur in wool ﬁber [ 70].Superoxide anion radical has been shown by Bruskov et al. [ 71] to be generatedby heating aqueous buffers containing oxygen and transition metal ion impurities.In this reaction, molecular oxygen is excited to singlet oxygen which is reduced tosuperoxide by the metal. Millington [ 67] pointed out that some dyes in the presence
of an electron donor can generate superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide by anelectron transfer mechanism. In addition, Misra [ 72] pointed out that superoxideradicals are formed by autoxidation of a large number of compounds includingsimple thiols, some iron complexes and reduced ﬂavins and quinones.These reactions are all fundamental to the reactions that can occur in human hairparticularly in those regions of the ﬁber where metals like Fe and Cu exist or whereeven low ppm levels of Cu or Fe are in the water supply.290 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
5.5.1 The Formation of Sulfur Type Free Radicalsin Keratin FibersThe events occurring when human hair is exposed to sunlight involve photo-degradation of the disulﬁde bond. This reaction affects the wet tensile properties.In addition, the surface becomes more hydrophilic. Photo-degradation of thethioester groups occurs at the surface and in the Beta layers of the cuticle CMC.A yellowing reaction occurs that involves tryptophan, cystine and other amino acidsin the cuticle, the cortex and other areas involving light or heat. Bleaching of hairpigments occurs in cortical cells (most but not all of pigment granules are insidecortical cells; a few are in between in the cortex CMC [ 73]), and hair ﬁbers becomemore sensitive to cuticle fragmentation (involving disulﬁde bonds inside cuticlecells and the other bonds in the cuticle CMC) and to axial fracturing which involvesevents occurring in the cortex CMC.The best description of the mechanism of photo-degradation of the disulﬁde
bond that I could ﬁnd has been described by Millington and Church [ 74]. Anymechanism to account for the changes occurring to cystine when keratin ﬁbers areexposed to sunlight must account for an increase in three products, cysteic acid,cysteine S-sulfonate and cysteine (thiol) groups [ 74]. When keratin ﬁbers areexposed to sunlight, UVB radiation in the range of 280–320 nm is absorbed bytyrosine and tryptophan residues and both of these species are excited to a higherenergy level [ 74].Tyrþhv 280 /C0320 nm ðÞ !1Tyr/C3Trpþhv 280 /C0320 nm ðÞ !1Trp/C3The energy absorbed by tyrosine is transferred to other groups including trypto-phan and cystine.1Try/C3þTrp!1Trp/C3þTyrIt has been known for some time that cystine is an effective quenching agent fortyrosine and tryptophan in proteins and the quenching mechanism has beendescribed as an electron transfer process forming this type of radical anion: RSSR/C15/C0
Several papers discuss the quenching by cystine disulﬁde in proteins whentyrosine or tryptophan nearby or adjacent to cystine in a polypeptide chain [ 75].It is possible that cystine quenching of tryptophan or tyrosine could be involved inthe reaction of alkaline peroxide with human hair. However, the radical anion ofcystine residues (above) can also form by one electron transfer involving metalions. This reaction is highly likely in the oxidation of human hair [ 76] withhydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, radical anions of disulﬁdes dissociate to forman equilibrium with a thiol anion and a thiyl radical as indicated below.5.5 Mechanisms for Free Radical Reactions in Human Hair 291

Millington and Church [ 74] proposed that since the S-sulfonate is formed
at higher wavelengths (UVA range and the higher the wavelength of radiation themore cysteine S-sulfonate formed) singlet oxygen is most likely involved as acompeting mechanism involving attack on the disulﬁde to form a zwitterionicspecies as proposed by Murray and Jindal [ 77]. Millington and Church [ 74]suggested this zwitterion could rearrange to produce the S-sulfonate (Bunte salt).However, Millington and Church did not explain exactly how the rearrangementwould occur. This species could produce the S-sulfonate with additional oxidationas suggested below. This reaction could involve singlet oxygen or molecularoxygen.292 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair

Bonifacic et al. [ 79] studied the primary steps in the reactions of organicdisulﬁdes with hydroxyl radicals in aqueous solution and identiﬁed the formation ofa radical cation adduct as a key intermediate of this reaction:{R-S-S-R.+   +   OH-}         =OHR-S   S-RThe primary fate of this adduct radical depends on the pH of the medium. Inbasic solution, the primary initial products are thiols and R-S-O•(sulﬁnyl radical)
formed most likely by SN2 substitution of RS/C0by OH/C0. Ultimately these materials(thiols and sulﬁnyl radicals) can be oxidized to sulfonate.5.5.4 Photochemical Reactions of Thioesters in HairThe thioester bond can be cleaved by the hydroperoxide anion or by the hydroxideanion by nucleophilic scission of the thioester link. For nucleophilic attack by thehydroperoxide anion one mole of the peroxy acid of MEA will be created, anothersource of hydroxyl free radicals.Hair-S-CO-MEA þHOO!Hair-S þHOO-CO-MEAThe thiol group can then be oxidized by oxygen, by hydrogen peroxide or theperoxy acid to Sulfonate. In the case of oxygen the ﬁrst step is the oxidation to thedisulﬁde. With oxygen, this reaction can be catalyzed by Fe or Cu and the formationof a metallic ion-thiol complex is believed to be responsible for increasing the rateof this oxidation with oxygen [ 80,81].5.5 Mechanisms for Free Radical Reactions in Human Hair 293
The reaction of sunlight on thioester is very different. A mechanism for thisreaction is summarized below. The ﬁrst step in the mechanism for the oxidationof thioester in sunlight involves the f ormation of an acyl and thiyl radical bythe action of ultraviolet light acting on the thioester group. Takahashi et al. [ 82]and Chatgilialoglu et al. [ 83] have shown that the forma tion of acyl radicals fromdifferent acyl groups including thioesters occurs by the action of ultraviolet light.Takahashi [ 82] conﬁrms by the following quote that this is a well acceptedreaction, “it is well accepted that upon irra diation, thioesters undergo homolyticcleavage to form an acyl and a thiyl rad ical pair with subs equent reaction.”The paper by Brown et al. [ 84] describes several free radicals formed inhexane or di-t-butyl peroxide solvent a t room temperature using 308 nm laserﬂash photolysis on aldehydes or ketones. Among the acyl radicals generated
were CH 3C•═O; CH 3–CH 2–C•═O; (CH 3)3CC•═O;a n dC 6H5C•═Oa n dt h e s eacyl radicals are analogs to the acyl radical that would be formed from 18-MEAattached to the hair surface. In additio n, some of the corresponding acyl peroxylradicals were formed in the work by Brown et al. by reaction of the acyl radicalswith oxygen similar to what is propose d in the mechanism described below.Proposed Mechanism for the Oxidation of  Thioester in Hair by Sunlight: O                                                   O  O  O  MEA-C-S-Hair    MEA-C.+      .S-HairMEA-C-OO.MEA-C-OOH   +  OH.HO.+    MEA-CO2.+  .OHHair-SO2.

enough to another thiol or sulfur group to form a disulﬁde bond then that reactioncannot occur. Therefore, this oxidation could bypass the disulﬁde stage and occurvia mobile oxidizing species such as molecular oxygen (superoxide, singlet oxygen,hydrogen peroxide or hydroperoxide anion, etc).294 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
Ruetsch et al. [ 40] state that for both the chemical (alkaline peroxide) andphotochemical oxidation of human hair thioester groups on the surface areconverted to sulfonate. However, they do not describe mechanistically how thishappens. In describing the chemical oxidation they state, “A side reaction ofbleaching is the hydrolysis of the thioester linkages”. It is true that some hydrolysiscould occur. However since the hydroperoxide anion is a stronger nucleophile thanhydroxide anion I would expect more cleavage by the hydroperoxide anion and alsoby free radical degradation. Nevertheless as indicated, I could ﬁnd nothing in thehair or wool literature describing this mechanism.5.5.5 Carbon Based Free Radicals from Tryptophan andPhenylalanineEvidence for the free radical decomposition of tryptophan has been presented byDomingues [ 85]. Tolgyesi [ 64] suggested that tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylala-
nine are involved in free radical formation. The hydroxylation of phenylalanine totyrosine has been observed by Bringans et al. [ 70] (conﬁrming the presence ofhydroxyl radicals in the oxidation of phenylanine). These references implicateseveral carbon based free radicals in the chemistry of human hair.5.5.6 Free Radicals from Allylic and Tertiary Versus AlphaHydrogensAnother important reaction involves formation of carbon based free radicals thatproduce hydroperoxides and thus are chain propagation reactions. This reaction andthe subsequent reactions of its products have already been explained as well as therelative stability of different allylic, tertiary and alpha hydrogen atoms in thisChapter in the section entitled, Long Term Irradiation Produces Fusion ReactionsAcross Structural Boundaries. Furthermore, the preference for allylic free radicalformation can be found in most organic chemistry texts such as Ege [ 86] who
explains that allylic free radicals will be formed preferentially over even those attertiary carbon positions because allylic free radicals are more stable.5.5.7 Chlorine Oxidation of Human HairAllworden [ 87] was the ﬁrst to treat hair with chlorine and bromine water.Allworden noted that bubbles or sacs form at the surface of the ﬁbers during thistype of treatment. This oxidizing system diffuses across the epicuticle membrane5.5 Mechanisms for Free Radical Reactions in Human Hair 295
and degrades the proteins beneath the membrane producing smaller, water-solubleproteins and polypeptides too large to migrate out of the hair. At the same time itdegrades and weakens the epicuticle. As a result, swelling occurs beneath theepicuticle, due to osmotic forces, producing the characteristic Allworden sacs(see Fig. 1.29).The qualitative observations of the Allworden reaction are produced by rela-tively large concentrations of chlorine or bromine water. Fair and Gupta [ 88] werethe ﬁrst to investigate the effect of chlorine water on hair, at the parts-per-millionlevel, in an attempt to assess the effects of chlorine in swimming pools on hair.In this study, hair effects were measured by following changes in hair ﬁberfriction. In general, the effect of chlorine was to increase the coefﬁcient of ﬁberfriction and to decrease the differential friction effect. Changes in hair friction were
observed even at parts-per-million levels of chlorine. Effects increased with thenumber of treatments and with decreasing pH from 8 to 2.The actual oxidizing species present in this system depends on pH and is eitherchlorine or hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Apparently, hypochlorous acid is the moreactive species on hair, since degradation is greater at lower pH. Although thechemical changes of these interactions were not examined, one would expectthioester and disulﬁde bond cleavage and peptide bond ﬁssion similar to the effectsshown for the reaction of chlorine and wool ﬁber [ 89]. For a more completediscussion of these effects see the section in Chap. 1entitled Epicuticle and HairFiber Structure and in Chap. 2entitled Composition and Components of theEpicuticle .5.5.8 Peracid Oxidation of Human HairPeracetic acid was the ﬁrst peracid studied extensively in keratin ﬁber research.
This highly reactive species ultimately became the vehicle used in the well-knownkeratose method by Alexander and Earland. This method is used to isolate keratosefractions from keratin ﬁbers and is described in Chap. 1of this manuscript.Large higher molecular weight peracids such as m-diperisophthalic acid havebeen studied. Such larger peracids tend to focus the oxidative degradation to theouter regions or the periphery of the ﬁbers producing a ring oxidation effectanalogous to ring dying, see Fig. 5.13. This ﬁgure contains a cross section of ahair ﬁber (in water) after reaction with m-diperisophthalic acid for nine treatments.Note the extreme swelling at the periphery of the ﬁber leaving an intact non-swollenor non-reacted ﬁber at the core. Figure 5.14 represents an SEM of the surface of anuntreated control ﬁber (dry) in this study. Figures 5.15,5.16 and5.17 depict thesurface of human hair ﬁbers in the dry state after 3, 7 and 20 treatments for 15-min
reaction times with m-diperisophthalic acid compared to the control (Fig. 5.14).Note the folds in the scales, indicating dissolution of scale material. These foldsincrease as the number of treatments increases producing a matrix-type appearance296 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
after seven treatments. After 20 treatments with this peracid, the complete loss ofcuticle scales has occurred, see Fig. 5.17.Figures 5.18,5.19 and5.20 illustrate another perspective of this treatment byviewing the ﬁbers in the wet state in water after different reaction times. Figure 5.18depicts the effects after three treatments and Fig. 5.19 after six peracid treatments.At this stage, after six treatments, the ﬁbers begin to display an Allworden typereaction in water. After nine treatments, scale material is still present, but theAllworden reaction is only transitory. Apparently, the proteins inside the cellmembranes are so degraded that they cause such a large uptake of water that theFig. 5.13 Light micrograph of a cross-section of a hair ﬁber reacted nine times for 15 min withm-diperisophthalic acid. Note the extensive swelling and cuticle damage in the peripheryFig. 5.14 SEM of a controlﬁber prior to treatment withm-diperisophthalic acid.

weakened membranes rupture after long water exposures. This effect is analogousto the effects of the long-term exposure of hair ﬁbers to sunlight followed bytreatment with alkaline peroxide, described to this author in a private communica-tion by Sigrid Ruetsch.The light micrograph of the hair ﬁber in Fig. 5.21was obtained from a ﬁber takendirectly from the scalp of an individual in a forensic study. However, the treatmentwas unknown. John T. Wilson a forensic scientist provided this micrograph to me.From the above micrographs, I conclude that this hair was exposed extensively tosunlight and peroxide bleaching. It is interesting that such cuticle scale degradationcan be produced on hair on live heads. The hair ﬁber of Fig. 5.22 shows whatappears to be a classical Allworden reaction; however, this effect was obtained after5 thirty-minute exposures to alkaline hydrogen peroxide that bleached the hair fromdark brown to golden brown followed by a single 15-min treatment with
m-diperisophthalic acid.After multiple treatments with m-diperisophthalic acid when bundles of ﬁbers ortresses are allowed to dry the ﬁbers actually appear glued together. These gluedﬁbers are reminiscent of the combined photochemical plus peroxide bleach treat-ment of Fig. 5.11. Examination of hair ﬁbers treated 12 times with this peracid anddried provided evidence that the ﬁbers are actually glued together (Fig. 5.23).Apparently the proteins of the cuticle are sufﬁciently solubilized so that some ofthe proteinaceous glue-like matter migrated out of the scales leaving a gelatin-likeFig. 5.15 SEM illustratingthe hair surface dry after threetreatments with m-diperisophthalic acid.

The cuticle scales fromﬁbers of this treatment, Fig. 5.23, appear to be gone over most of the ﬁber surface,but are actually covered by the proteinaceous deposit. The scales appear only where“glue” has been separated from the underlying scales. After 20 treatments withm-diperisophthalic acid, the scales are totally removed. Fracturing of hair ﬁbersafter this peracid treatment has not been examined, but would likely reveal someinteresting new ﬁndings.Fig. 5.18 Light micrograph (optical section) illustrating the hair surface in water after threetreatments with m-diperisophthalic acid.

5.6 Hair Pigment Structure and Chemical Oxidation5.6.1 Hair Pigment Production and Pigment in DifferentHair TypesThe principal pigments of human hair are the brown-black melanins (eumelanins)and the less prevalent red pigments, the pheomelanins. These latter pigments at onetime were called trichosiderins. The genes involved in the formation of theFig. 5.20 Light micrograph (optical section) of the hair surface in water after nine treatments withm-diperisophthalic acid. Note the extensive swelling and lifting of cuticle scalesFig. 5.21 Light micrograph of a damaged hair ﬁber taken from the head of a forensic study.Treatment unknown, but probably ultraviolet exposed and chemically bleached (Light micrographkindly provided by John T.

melanosomes and different hair colors are summarized in Chap. 3in the sectionentitled, Hair Pigmentation and Genetics . For the discussion, in this Chapter thebrown-black pigments of hair will be referred to as melanins and the yellow–redpigments will be referred to as pheomelanins.Birbeck and Mercer [ 90] determined that the pigments in scalp hair reside withinthe cortex and medulla as ovoid or spherical granules. Barnicot et al. [ 91] concludedthat the pigment granules generally range in size from about 0.4–1.0 mm along theirmajor axis; see Figs. 5.24 and5.25. These SEMs show some partially dissolvedFig. 5.22 Hair ﬁber bleached ﬁve times for 30 min with alkaline peroxide and then once withm-diperisophthalic acid.

melanin granules and some holes or vacancies where melanin granules have beendissolved from the ﬁber. Hair pigments are produced by the melanocytes (melaninproducing cells) and are packed into the melanosomes which are pigmentcontaining granules. The pigment granules are then transferred into thekeratinocytes (hair ﬁber cells). Tobin and Paus [ 92] suggested that with age thereis a deﬁciency in the melanosome transfer process. A relatively small number ofmelanocytes are necessary to produce an intensely pigmented hair ﬁber of 1 m orlonger. These melanocytes function in 7–15 hair cycles to produce pigmented hairsfor up to four decades or longer [ 92]. Tobin and Paus also suggested that eachmelanocyte has a “melanogenesis clock” or each melanocyte can produce a limitedamount of melanin which determines a melanocyte lifetime. They concluded thatepidermal pigmentation changes are more subtle than those in the graying of hair
because the melanocytes in the hair bulb age faster due to the highly intenseproduction of melanin required by hair cycles. Furthermore, the hair graying effectresults from a decrease and the eventual termination of the activity of the enzymetyrosinase in the lower hair bulb. This enzyme is involved in the reaction calledRaper’s scheme described in the next section in this Chapter.Figure 5.24 shows pigment granules as they appear inside the ﬁber. Thismicrograph was obtained after fracturing photo-oxidized hair. Figure 5.25 alsoshows ovoid cavities where pigment granules have been dissolved and removedby photo-oxidation and subsequent treatment with alkaline peroxide. Hair pigmentsare found in the cortex and the medulla and not normally found in the cuticle ofscalp hair. Most but not all of the pigment granules are inside cortical cells; someare in between these cells in the cortex–cortex CMC [ 73]. Menkart et al. [ 93]
concluded that pigment granules generally comprise less than 3% of the total ﬁbermass, as estimated by the residue weight after acid hydrolysis.Schwan-Jonczyk [ 94] suggested that the size of melanin granules, in addition tothe total melanin content and type of melanin (eumelanin vs. pheomelanin) deter-mine hair color. For example, she cites that Black African hair contains largeeumelanin granules about 0.8 mm along their major axis, while Japanese hair hassmaller eumelanin granules about 0.5 mm and blonde European hair contains evensmaller primarily pheomelanin granules about 0.3 mm. Schwan-Jonczyk suggestedthat as a general rule, black hair contains primarily large eumelanin granules,medium to light brown hair contains both eumelanin and pheomelanin granulesand blonde hair contains primarily pheomelanin granules that are smaller.These observations by Schwan-Jonczyk are consistent with those of Swift [ 95]
who several years ago in his Ph.D. thesis reported, via measurements with theelectron microscope, that melanin granules from hair of black Africans is largerthan those from Caucasian hair. Bernicot and Birbeck [ 96] determined that thepigment granules from dark European hair are on average larger than those ofblonde and red hair which is consistent with Schwan-Jonczyk’s conclusions.Fitzpatrick et al. [ 97] conﬁrmed that the pigment granules of hair of Africandescendants tend to be larger than those of dark European hair.The pigment in hair is produced by melanocytes that are associated with eachindividual hair ﬁber. Thus, there is no transfer of pigment or melanosomes from one304 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
hair ﬁber to another during biosynthesis. This fact accounts for hairs of verydifferent pigmentation (colors) growing adjacent to each other. The melanocytesin the skin of Blacks appear similar to those of Caucasians. However, Barnicot andBirbeck [ 96] state that the pigment granules in the skin of Blacks are larger andmore numerous than in the skin of Caucasians, similar to the pigment granules inthe hair of Blacks and Caucasians.This heavy pigmentation in African type hair is very useful in two distinctlydifferent situations. First of all the pigments in hair protect it from many photo-chemical [ 98] and thermal reactions such as in straightening of hair with hot irons orpresses. These protective actions become more important to Blacks as they age andthe graying process begins. Because this protection decreases as the pigments arereduced in the hair. Secondly, hair pigments reduce the amount of light scattered
from the hair. Therefore, these pigments help to improve hair luster as shown byKeis et al. [ 99]. Keis et al. determined that single hairs of African Americans areamong the shiniest of hairs [ 99]. It is only because of the high coiling and pooralignment that an array of African type hair appears dull. Therefore, curly to highlycoiled hair of Blacks that is often thought of as not being shiny would be even lessshiny if it contained less pigment.Fine hair tends to be lighter in color than coarse hair. The extreme casesupporting this statement is that vellus hair, the ﬁnest of all hairs does not containpigment, whereas most permanent hairs that is the coarsest of hairs generallycontain pigment. Caucasian hair on average is ﬁner than Asian or African hairand it also tends to be lighter in color.There are likely exceptions to this conclusion that ﬁne hair tends to be lighter in
color than coarse hair. Exceptions are likely because hair color is determined byseveral variables including the type of melanin pigment present, the size of thepigment granules and the density (frequency) of the pigment granules that aredispersed throughout the cortex of human scalp hair ﬁbers. Nevertheless, thereare several other references (below) supporting this conclusion.Pecoraro et al. [ 100] examined hair from 26 infants within 76 h of birthconsidering hairs from 13 males and 13 females and found that the mean coarsenessof dark hairs from dark complexioned newborns was 37 mm while the averagediameter for light colored hairs from light complexioned newborns was 22 mm.Trotter and Dawson [ 101,102] examined hair from 310 children and adultCaucasians (French Canadians) and f ound that more coarse hair tends to bedarker than ﬁner hair [ 101,102], see Table 5.7. In addition, Bogaty [ 103]h a sshown in his review of the anthropological l iterature that Cau casian children’s
hair is on average ﬁner, rounder, less fre quently medullated and lighter in colorthan adult’s hair.One possible exception to the above conclusion is gray hair. The graying processin terms of comparisons of gray to white and dark hair needs additional study,however, we do know there is less pigment in gray hair than in dark hair. Mostlikely the pigment granules of gray hair are also smaller in size, both actions a resultof changes in the melanization process with ageing described above. Hollfelderet al. [ 104] have provided evidence from ﬁve Caucasians that gray hairs on the same5.6 Hair Pigment Structure and Chemical Oxidation 305
person are coarser and wavier than highly pigmented hairs. This observation byHollfelder et al. is consistent with observations by Yin et al. [ 105] that ﬁneCaucasian hair is straighter than coarse Caucasian hair.Van Neste [ 106] examined approximately 60 hairs from each of three differentscalp sites (left and right top of head and occipital) from 24 women. Twelve of thesewomen were menopausal with an average age of 59.6 and 12 were premenopausaland younger but the average age was not given. A total of 3,343 hairs wereexamined after classiﬁcation as pigmented (P) and non-pigmented (W). The aver-age diameter of W hairs exceeded the P hairs by 10.27 mm, p¼0.0001. Themedulla of W hairs was more developed than in the P hairs, p ¼0.0001 and thegrowth rate of the W hairs was about 10% faster than the P hairs. This study is inagreement with the one by Hollfelder et al. suggesting that gray-white hairs arecoarser than pigmented hairs.
coarser than pigmented hairs.However, Gao and Bedell [ 107] studying gray hair and dark hairs from fourpersons plus one sample of pooled gray hair, measured cross-sectional parameterswith a laser-scanning micrometer and found no signiﬁcant differences in themaximum center diameter, center ellipticity and cross-sectional areas; howeverthe center minimum diameter of the black ﬁbers were slightly larger than for thoseof gray hairs. At this time, there is more evidence favoring that gray hairs arecoarser than pigmented hairs; however, the evidence is not overwhelming.Coarser gray hairs would reinforce the thought proposed by several that the
medulla is involved in graying, because the medulla at one time appeared to beinvolved in the genetic abnormality of pili annulati or ringed hair. This abnormalityappears as bands or rings of silver or gray and dark regions along the ﬁber axis. But,ringed hair has been shown to contain bands with and without holes in the cortexalong the axis, and these bands correspond to the gray and dark bands. For a morecomplete description of ringed hair, see Chap. 1.Nagase et al. [ 108] demonstrated that hair with a porous medulla gives a whitish
appearance with lower luster. These scientists actually measured a decrease in colorfrom hair with a porous medulla. This effect is attributed to an increase in thescattering of light by the medullary pores, part of which is due to a change inrefractive index by the hair to air interfaces at medullary spaces. Therefore, grayhair can be made whiter by a porous medulla which adds to the primary effect ofgraying produced by less pigment.Table 5.7 Caucasian children’s hair tends to be ﬁner and lighter than adult’s haira[101]Ages N Diameter ( m) Brown–black Blond–dark blond Light blond0–4 46 58 35 50 155–9 36 66 75 22 310–14 45 69 96 4 015–19 56 74 98 2 020–29 52 73 98 2 030+ 75 70 97 3 0310aData from Anthropological study of French Canadian hair by Trotter and Dawson [ 102]306 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
As indicated, hair pigments function to provide photochemical protection to hairproteins and lipid structures especially at lower wavelengths where both thepigments and hair proteins absorb light (primarily between 254 and 350 nm).Hair pigments absorb light and dissipate the energy as heat. Thus, the pigmentsare slowly degraded or bleached and in that process they inhibit or minimizedegradation to the structural proteins and lipids of hair, inhibiting hair damagewhich can be detected in the tensile properties [ 107].Methods for pigment granule isolation usually involve dissolving the hair fromthe granules [ 13,91,109–115]. Laxer [ 112] described a non-hydrolytic methodinvolving reﬂux for 24 h in a phenol hydrate-thioglycolic acid mixture. The generalcomposition of melanin granules consists of pigment, protein, and minerals. Flesch[13] reported a similar general composition for the pheomelanin-containing
granules. Schmidli et al. [ 113,114], after acid or alkaline hydrolysis of hair, isolatedmelanin combined with protein and suggested that melanin exists in combinationwith protein in the granules, sometimes referred to as melanoprotein.Since the pigment granules of human scalp hair are located primarily in thecortical cells and the medulla, it is reasonable to assume that pigment degradationby chemical means is a diffusion-controlled process. However, evidence supportingthis contention is not available at this time. In fact, determining the rate-controllingstep in this process is a large-order task, since it is difﬁcult to quantitatively followthe loss of pigment in hair. Furthermore, two important side reactions consumeoxidizing agent: the previously described oxidation of amino acid residues [ 5] and,in addition, dibasic amino acid residues of hair associate with many oxidizingagents, including hydrogen peroxide and persulfate [ 115,116].
5.6.2 Eumelanins and Pheomelanins: Their Biosynthesis andProposed StructuresAs indicated, melanins are synthesized in melanocytes (melanin producing cells) instructures called melanosomes; eumelanin from the amino acid tyrosine and/orphenylalanine and pheomelanin from tyrosine and cysteine.Raposo et al. [ 117] described the development of melanosomes in four stages.Five stages are presented here. In early development, melanosomes appear as roundamorphous vesicles. Yasumoto and Hearing [ 118] demonstrated that the gp100protein (Pmel17) generates structural changes in melanosomes producing ﬁbrillarelliptical melanosomes from the amorphous vesicles. After these structural changesother proteins including melanogenic enzymes, pH regulators and transportproteins are targeted to the melanosomes which begin synthesis of the melaninpigments. When the melanosomes are ﬁlled with pigments the melanosomegranules are transferred to keratinocytes the cells that form the shaft of hair ﬁbers.
Donatien and Orlow [ 119] suggested that melanin is deposited in melanosomeson a protein matrix inside the melanosomes. Donatien and Orlow [ 119] identiﬁedthe si locus and membrane-bound p locus proteins as melanosomal matrix proteins.5.6 Hair Pigment Structure and Chemical Oxidation 307
Melanin containing melanosomes ultimately become melanin granules after beingtransferred into keratinocytes.The intensity or depth of hair color is related to both the size of the melaningranules and the total melanin content or the melanin granule density. In addition,the proportion of eumelanin to pheomelanin is also important, but not the onlyfactor in determining the shade of hair color. Orlow et al. [ 120] prepareddihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) (see Fig. 5.26) enzymatically andvia chemical synthesis. Orlow et al. then polymerized DHICA to form brownmelanin type polymers that were soluble above pH 5. They also formed black,insoluble melanin precipitates from dihydroxyindole (DHI), dopa or dopachrome(see Fig. 5.26).When DHICA was in molar excess, mixtures of these two monomers (DHI and
DHICA) under the same reaction conditions formed brown melanins. However, blackmelanins were formed when DHI was in excess. A similar color effect likely existsfor natural melanins in human hair. It is also possible that an analogous situationoccurs for pheomelanin for intermediates in this process (see Fig. 5.26)c a u s i n gs h i f t sfrom yellow to red or perhaps even from brown to red to yellow. At this stage5-cysteinylDOPA is one of the preferred intermediates in the pheomelanin pathway.Fig. 5.26 Biosynthetic pathway for the formation of eumelanin, pheomelanin and mixedmelanins proposed by Ito and Wakamatsu [ 131]308 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
Schwan-Jonczyk [ 94] suggested that Black-African hair contains ovoid orspherical eumelanin granules about 0.8 mm along their major axis existing as singlegranules or aggregates. Asian hair contains single melanin granules about 0.5 mmwhile dark blond European hair contains agglomerates of pheomelanin granulesabout 0.3 mm along their major axis [ 94]. As a general rule the darker the hair thehigher proportion of eumelanin to pheomelanin in the granules and dark hairgenerally contains very little pheomelanin.From cross-sections of African hair vs. dark-brown Caucasian hair the melaningranule density clearly appears higher in African hair. Publications by Kita et al.[121,122] on melanin granule size and density in East Asian hair reported a highermelanin density in the outer cortex vs. the inner cortex which is typical of Cauca-sian and African hair too. These scientists found no difference in melanin granule
size and density in infant hair compared to 20–30 year olds. However, the minoraxis of the granules was signiﬁcantly smaller at age 60–70 than for the other agegroups. The density of the melanin granules was also lower at the advanced agethan for the other two age groups [ 121,122].5.6.3 Degradation Products of MelaninsSeveral years ago, R.A. Nicolaus, G. Prota and others [ 123–125] isolated a fewpyrrole carboxylic acids and indole derivatives from degradation studies of melanins.Two of the pyrrole derivatives were pyrrole-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (PDCA) andpyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (PTCA). PDCA has been suggested by Ito [ 126]and Borges et al. [ 127] as a marker for 5,6-Dihydroxyindole (DHI) and PTCA amarker for 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid two important monomeric unitssuggested by Ito and Wakamatsu [ 128] to create the oligomers that comprise theeumelanin polymer in hair and skin (see Fig. 5.27).
Pyrole tricarboxylic acid (PTCA) and pyrole dicarboxylic acid (PDCA) aredegradation products of eumelanins formed from oxidation with either permanga-nate or alkaline peroxide [ 123–125,127]. Other degradation products have beenisolated from pheomelanins and used for analysis or for proposing structures [ 129],see Fig. 5.27. Napolitano et al. [ 129] have shown that AHPs, 3-AT, BTCA andTTCA are degradation products of pheomelanins. The former two from hydroiodicacid hydrolysis and the four from alkaline peroxide oxidation.Several degradation products of eumelanins and pheomelanins are depicted inFig.5.27. Analytical schemes have been described using these degradation productsas markers for eumelanin and pheomelanin. Oxidation with acidic permanganateand alkaline peroxide has been used with both eumelanins and pheomelanins.Oxidation of DHICA melanins provides PTCA as a marker and DHI melanins
provide PDCA, however, the yields of PDCA are so small that a large multiplyingfactor must be used to approximate the amount of DHI melanin. This multiplierprovides a potentially large error especially in eumelanin plus pheomelanin5.6 Hair Pigment Structure and Chemical Oxidation 309
(smaller multiplying factor) comparisons. In some instances PTCA is used as anindicator of total eumelanin.Alkaline peroxide oxidation of pheomelanins provides TTCA in low yield;however much higher yields of AHPs are provided by HI hydrolysis ofpheomelanins. For the two amino hydroxyl phenylalanines (AHPs) depicted inFig.5.27 the 4-amino-3-hydroxy phenylalanine has been called speciﬁc AHP byIto, Wakamatsu and Rees [ 130]. This term, speciﬁc AHP, is used because thatisomer is provided in higher yield from pheomelanin and because the other isomer,3-AT of Fig. 5.27, can be produced by HI hydrolysis of certain proteins whichinterferes in the AHP analysis for pheomelanin [ 130].5.6.4 Biosynthetic Pathway for Mixed MelanogenesisSeveral papers have shown that in the formation of most natural melanins, forhuman hair or skin, mixed melanogenesis occurs rather than exclusively formingeumelanin or pheomelanin [ 127,131]. Ito and Wakamatsu [ 131] in an important
paper proposed the biosynthetic pathway for formation of mixed melaninssummarized in Fig. 5.26. In this pathway, tyrosine is oxidized by the enzymetyrosinase to dopaquinone (DQ). This enzymatic reaction occurs faster near neutralthan at acidic pH. When cysteine is present above a concentration of about0.13mmolar then S-cysteinylDOPAs are formed; however 5-ScysteinylDOPA isthe preferred intermediate. 5-ScysteinylDOPA rapidly cyclizes internally to theFig. 5.27 Degradationproducts of eumelanins andpheomelanins. PTCA andPDCA are produced by eitheracidic permanganate oralkaline peroxide oxidation ofeumelanins. PTCA isconsidered a marker forDHICA eumelanins andPDCA a marker for DHIeumelanins. AHPs (AHP and3-AT) are produced by HIhydrolysis of pheomelanins.AHP is considered a markerfor pheomelanin, while 3-ATits isomer is considered tointerfere in the determinationand should be separated fromAHP310 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
corresponding benzothiazine or other intermediates as suggested by Napolitanoet al. [ 132]. These are in turn oxidized to pheomelanin oligomeric units and then tored-yellow pheomelanin polymers.Chintala et al. [ 133] proposed via experiments with mice that the SNP Slc7a11forms a protein that transports either cystine or glutathione (a tripeptide containingcysteine) to the melanosomes. A reducing agent such as bME is necessary to reducethe disulﬁde bonds of cystine to form cysteine for pheomelanin production.A related process must also occur with cystine or glutamate transport/reductionfor pheomelanin formation in human hair. However, this process has not beendescribed prior to this writing.If cysteine is not present or below the critical concentration of 0.13 mmolar thenthe eumelanin pathway is followed and cyclodopa is formed from dopaquinone.
Cyclodopa then cyclizes internally to dopachrome; pH is also important to thisreaction which occurs faster near neutral than at acid pH. In the next step, theenzyme TRYP-2 prevents the decarboxylation of dopachrome allowing the forma-tion of DHICA. If TRYP-2 is absent decarboxylation occurs forming DHI. BothDHI and DHICA are capable of polymerizing to form eumelanin type polymers.However, when the DHICA concentration is above that of DHI, brown melanins areformed. But, when the DHI level is higher, black melanins are formed.Ito and Wakamatsu [ 131] concluded that when tyrosine concentration is highand cysteine is low and the pH is near neutral, the eumelanin pathway is preferred.Therefore, higher ratios of eumelanin/pheomelanin are formed. However, whentyrosine concentration is low and cysteine concentration is high and the pH is acidicthe pheomelanin pathway is preferred. In that case lower ratios of eumelanin/pheomelanin are formed.5.6.5 Casing Model for Mixed Melanogenesis
5.6.5 Casing Model for Mixed MelanogenesisIto and Wakamatsu [ 131] proposed a casing model for mixed melanogenesis whichappears to be the predominant pathway for formation of the pigments in human hairﬁbers and in skin. This model is becoming more widely accepted because mostnatural pigments of hair and skin contain both eumelanin and pheomelanin [ 130].For example, Thody et al. [ 134] found eumelanin and pheomelanin in samples ofepidermis from 13 Caucasian subjects with different types of skin. In addition theyfound that the relative proportions of eumelanin to pheomelanin in the hair of thesesame subjects correlated with the relative proportions in skin.In the casing model, DQ is ﬁrst formed by oxidation of tyrosine by tyrosinase.Then cysteine reacts with DQ to form cysteinylDOPAs which cyclize and oxidize
to form pheomelanin molecules. These reactions occur in the membrane ofmelanosomes. Pheomelanin molecules are apparently released to the interior ofthe melanosome where they aggregate or cluster to form a core of pheomelanin.A switch then occurs to begin the production of eumelanin as described in thebiosynthetic scheme summarized in Fig. 5.26. Eumelanin polymers are then5.6 Hair Pigment Structure and Chemical Oxidation 311
released to the interior of the melanosome where they deposit on top of the core ofpheomelanin. Thus, the ﬁnal hair color, its intensity and shade are inﬂuenced by thethickness and the uniformity of the eumelanin coating as well as by the size of thecore of the pheomelanin. These factors are probably more relevant to the shade ofthe ﬁnal hair color than the ratio of eumelanin to pheomelanin.5.6.6 pH and MelanogenesisFuller et al. [ 135] examined melanocytes from both Blacks and Caucasians. Thenumber of melanocytes and the tyrosinase levels were found to be virtuallythe same. However, the activity of tyrosinase was nearly tenfold higher in themelanocytes of Blacks. Fuller et al. [ 135] treated the Caucasian melanocytes withammonium chloride and with the ionophores nigericin and monensin. Theseingredients increased the pH and rapidly increased tyrosinase activity. However,when Smith et al. [ 136] added sodium hydrogen exchangers (NHEs), which add
protons, the activity decreased in Black melanocytes. But, these same NHEs hadvirtually no effect on the activity of Caucasian melanocytes.Fuller et al. [ 135] also found that treatment of Caucasian melanocytes with theweak base acridine orange (a ﬂuorescent staining agent) stains Caucasianmelanosomes but not Black melanosomes. This staining reaction suggests thatCaucasian melanosomes are acidic and those from Blacks are neutral. Fullerpointed out that it is well known that tyrosinase acitivity is low in acid and higherat neutral pH. Therefore, pH is important to the rate of reactivity of tyrosinase. Andhigher pH near neutral, produces more eumelanin in melanocytes in the skin ofBlacks vs. Caucasians.Ancans and Tobin et al. [ 137] examined several different skin types and deter-mined that melanosomal pH determines the rate of melanogenesis, the ratio ofeumelanin to pheomelanin and the maturation and transfer of melanosomes to
keratinocytes. These scientists also suggested that the P protein is involved inproviding the effective pH for these effects. Cheli et al. [ 138] more recentlyconﬁrmed the critical role of melanosomal pH in pigmentation and identiﬁedcyclic-adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP) and the a-melanocyte stimulating hor-mone ( a-MSH) as important factors for pH control.5.6.7 Proposed Structures for Eumelanin and Pheomelanin5.6.7.1 Proposed Structures for EumelaninThe exact structures for eumelanin or pheomelanin are not known. More than50 years ago, Mason [ 139] proposed that melanin consisted of a homopolymerformed from dihydroxyindole. Nicolaus [ 140] then proposed that melanin is acomplex random polymer formed from several intermediates of the Raper scheme,312 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
which is essentially the eumelanin pathway described in Fig. 5.26. The Nicolausproposal is clearly closer to our current point-of-view.More recently, Napolitano et al. [ 141] provided evidence that the oligomericunits of synthetic DHICA eumelanins are of low molecular weights (in the range of500–1500 Daltons) similar to the units suggested by Ito and Wakamatsu [ 131]i nFig.5.28. Estimates of the molecular weights of the polymers are higher but theseestimates are in question because of the poor solubility and irreversible binding tothe chromatographic columns used in the molecular weight analysis.Ito and Simon [ 142] described the current view in 2004 of the structure ofeumelanins in a concise letter to the editor. Ito provided additional details inFig. 5.28 Suggested partial structures for Eumelanin by Kaxiras et al. [ 143] and by Ito andWakamatsu [ 131]. The cyclic structure shown in the bottom right hand corner is a structure
isolated by Arzillo et al. [ 144] formed from the dimer and trimer of the dihydroxyindoles shown ontheleftfrom reaction with peroxidase/hydrogen peroxide under biomimetic conditions5.6 Hair Pigment Structure and Chemical Oxidation 313
these papers [ 126,128,131,142] with representative structures for oligomeric unitsfor both eumelanin and pheomelanin [ 131]. Two suggested representativestructures for the oligomeric units of eumelanins are depicted in Fig. 5.28. Thestructure suggested by Ito and Wakamatsu is based primarily on the degradationproducts formed from the oxidation of eumelanin and its chemical properties.Actually this structure with a methylene group in place of the carbonyl joiningthe rings was proposed a few years earlier by Napolitano.A theoretical structural model for Eumelanin containing only DHI has beensuggested by Kaxiras et al. [ 143] (see Fig. 5.28) and is an interesting one in that itaddresses many of the physical and chemical requirements of eumelanin. Thisstructure would theoretically be formed from DHI or its hydroquinone and/ortautomers. These tautomers contain 4 or 5 DHI units to form the basic oligomer
which is a porphyrin type ring structure. This type of structure is capable ofcapturing and releasing a variety of metal ions, an important property of eumelaninpigments. Smaller or larger ring formations are unstable.Kaxiras et al. [ 143] proposed that the more stable ring systems which are thesetetramer and/or pentamer oligomers would stack in “planar graphite-likearrangements” to form the polymeric structure. This model is consistent withX-ray scattering data of melanin structures. The calculated absorption spectrumfor this model suggests it is dark black and thus consistent with DHI-richeumelanin. However, introducing DHICA and other monomers into this type ofmodel has not been addressed at the time of this writing.In 2010, Arzillo and Napolitano et al. [ 144] isolated the macrocyclic structureformed from the methylated dihydroxyindole depicted in Fig. 5.28. This structure
was formed by reaction with peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide under biomimeticconditions and provides evidence that structures analogous to the one proposed byKaxiras et al. [ 143] can be formed by polymerization of dihydroxyindoles.5.6.7.2 Proposed Structures for PheomelaninsA general chemical structure for natura l pheomelanins recently proposed by Itoand Wakamatsu [ 131] is depicted in Fig. 5.29. This structure consists ofbenzothiazine monomeric units that are com bined. This structure is consistentwith degradation products and the biosynthetic scheme summarized in Fig. 5.26.However, Napolitano et al. [ 132] recently monitored the oxidative formation ofpheomelanin type products from 5-cystei nylDOPA by liquid chromatography/UVand mass spectrometry and suggested that such structures need reassessmentconcluding that species such as those summarized in Fig. 5.30, based on absorp-tion properties and reduction behavior, are likely involved in the formation of
pheomelanin. Napolitano et al. [ 132] suggested that “beyond the involvement of3-oxo-3,4-dihydrobenzothiazine and ben zothiazole units it is not possible to go”at this time.314 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
5.6.8 Degradation Products of Hair Pigments and DifferentHair ColorsUse of eumelanin and pheomelanin degradation products (in the section entitled,Degradation Products of Melanins ) for analysis of human hair of different colors hasbeen provided in several papers. Borges et al. [ 127] collected and analyzed humanhair from 44 subjects: 3 African Americans with black hair, 1 Amerindian with blackhair, 6 Asians with black hair, 6 Caucasians with black hair, 2 Hispanics withblack hair, 12 people with brown hair, 8 people with blonde hair and 6 people withred hair. Borges et al. determined multiplication factors that they used to approxi-mate the relative amounts of eumelanin and pheomelanin in these hair samples. Thedata of Table 5.8shows that black hair contains more total eumelanin than other hairtypes and red hair has the most pheomelanin or the most CystDOPA (see thebiosynthetic scheme of Fig. 5.26 for CystDOPA). Differences of total melanin asFig. 5.29 Structure proposed
Fig. 5.29 Structure proposedfor pheomelanins by Ito andWakamatsu [ 131]Fig. 5.30 Units suggested for pheomelanins by Napolitano et al. [ 132]5.6 Hair Pigment Structure and Chemical Oxidation 315
large as a factor of 2 were found in the different black hair samples. Borges et al. alsofound both eumelanin and pheomelanin in all hair samples. However, only lowlevels of pheomelanin were found in black hair samples.Some of the conclusions of Borges et al. are summarized below:– Average black human hair contains about 1% pheomelanin and 99% eumelanin– Brown and blonde hair contains about 5% pheomelanin and 95% eumelanin anddiffers primarily in the amount of total melanin present.– Red hair contains about one third pheomelanin and two third eumelanin. Noattempts were made to differentiate between different shades of red hair in thiswork.With regard to hair color, Rees [ 145] suggested that black hair has a high ratio ofeumelanin to pheomelanin, whereas red hair has a low ratio of eumelanin topheomelanin, and blonde hair contains little of either eumelanin or pheomelanin.The data of Borges et al. [ 127] in Table 5.8are consistent with these suggestions.
The data by Borges et al. suggest that brown hair has slightly higher amounts ofeumelanin than blonde hair and nearly equal amounts of DHI and DHICA whereasblack hair has more eumelanin and a higher ratio of DHI to DHICA than brownhair.Napolitano et al. [ 129] examined 16 different colors of human hair for threepheomelanin markers AHPs, TTCA, BTCA and one eumelanin marker PTCA.Among these 16 different hair colors were Black, Dark Brown, Brown, Blonde,Light Blonde and Albino and 10 different colors of red hair.

yield of each marker in ng per mg of hair, but did not attempt to convert the data toamounts of eumelanin or pheomelanin. I analyzed these data by various regressionmodels and found no signiﬁcant difference using all her raw data and various ratiosand sums. However, when I analyzed these data for the ten red hair plus the albinohair sample for the ratio of PTCA/AHPs vs. the sum of PTCA plus AHPs I found ahighly signiﬁcant quadratic ﬁt with an R2of 0.85 using the natural log of the ratiovs. the sum of PTCA plus AHP’s.I then looked at the six non-red hair samples and arbitrarily assigned a colorfactor of 1–6 for hair darkness with black as 6, dark brown as 5, brown as 4, Blondeas 3, light blonde as 2, and albino as 1 and found a highly signiﬁcant relationshipbetween this arbitrary color factor and the sum of AHPs plus PTCA (linear modelp¼0.0007; R2¼0.958; RMSE ¼23.94 and quadratic model p ¼0.0018;R2¼0.985; RMSE ¼16.339).
R2¼0.985; RMSE ¼16.339).These statistical analyses suggests that for regression models for natural haircolor based on the degradation products for eumelanin and pheomelanin it is betterto separate black-brown-blonde hair from red hair. One reason is that themultiplying factors for the different markers for eumelanin and pheomelanin aretoo different and interfere with comparisons between red and non-red hair samples.Napolitano et al. [ 129] suggested four basic types of pigmentation for humanhair based on degradation criteria:Eumelanic Type I (PTCA 100–300 ng/mg)Eumelanic Type II (PTCA 50–100 ng/mg)Pheomelanic Type I (BTCA 1,000–2,500 ng/mg and TTCA 200–250 ng/mg)Pheomelanic Type II (TTCA 100–300 ng/mg)From their data, the eumelanic type I hair covers black, dark brown and brownand distinguishes that group from the blondes and the many different reds.Pheomelanic type I cover the deep and dark reds and is distinguished from the
other types primarily by BTCA providing values from 1,000 to 2,500 ng/mg ofpheomelanins. The other two types do not appear to be as clearly distinguished.Panaella and Napolitano et al. [ 146] published a newer method suggestingsimultaneous determination of PTCA and BTCA as markers for eumelanin andpheomelanin which is worth exploring. See Chap. 3for a discussion on the Geneticsof hair pigmentation in the section entitled, Hair Pigmentation and Genetics whichhelps to explain some of the color differences in hair.5.6.9 Chemical Oxidation of Hair PigmentsWolfram and co-workers [ 12,147] studied the oxidation of human hair with andwithout pigment. They also studied the oxidation of melanin granules isolated fromhuman hair. These scientists found that hair with pigment degrades hydrogenperoxide at a measurably faster rate than hair without pigment. Since melanin5.6 Hair Pigment Structure and Chemical Oxidation 317
represents about 2% of the hair, this result suggests a faster rate of reaction ofperoxide with hair pigment than with hair proteins.For the reaction of peroxide with hair containing no pigment vs. hair containingpigment, the initial reaction rates are similar (through 10 min). However, longerreaction times (30–90 min) produce markedly different reaction rates. Theinitial rates, due to reaction with the surface and cuticle layers are expected to besimilar, since pigment is not in the cuticle. However, as the reaction continuesand the pigment becomes involved, peroxide is degraded faster by the pigment-containing hair.Treatment of isolated melanin granules (from hair) with a large number ofreagents (at different pH values) including thioglycolic acid, persulfate, permanga-nate, or perchlorate failed to provide detectable physical changes in the granules.
However, treatment of the granules with alkaline hydrogen peroxide producesdisintegration and dissolution of the granules. Wolfram also found that the pH ofdissolution is at a maximum near the pK of hydrogen peroxide (pH 11.75).Furthermore, the dissolved pigment produces an intensely colored solution thatfades on further reaction.Wolfram [ 147] examined the effects of different oxidizing agents on their abilityto decolorize soluble melanin and found the following order of efﬁciency: perman-ganate >hypochlorite ¼peracid >peroxide. This ﬁnding suggests that the mela-
nin pigments within the granules are not accessible to most oxidizing agents.Furthermore, the granules must be degraded perhaps even solubilized beforeextensive decolorization of the pigment chromophore can occur. The ﬁrst step(dissolution of the pigment granules) is a relatively speciﬁc reaction requiringoxidation at speciﬁc sites. Hydrogen peroxide is not as strong an oxidizing agentas permanganate or peracetic acid, but it is actually more effective for dissolvingthe granules than either of these other two oxidizing species. Once the granules aredissolved, reactions to degrade the chromophoric units of melanin can proceedmore readily. Since the melanin chromophoric units contain many different sitessusceptible to oxidation, the rate of the second step (degradation of the pigmentchromophore) proceeds faster with the stronger oxidizing agents—e.g., permanga-nate>hypochlorite ¼peracid >peroxide—which is the order for decolorizationof the solubilized melanin.
of the solubilized melanin.Although persulfate is not a stronger oxidant than hydrogen peroxide, mixturesof persulfate and peroxide provide a more effective bleaching system than peroxidealone. Martin [ 148] studied the persulfate oxidation of fungal melanins. He deter-mined that persulfate is a selective oxidizing agent, releasing only those portions ofmelanins containing primarily fatty acids and phenolic compounds. Persulfate andperoxide are both somewhat selective in their attack on melanins. Presumably,peroxide attacks different portions or sites on the melanin macromolecules thatfacilitates solubilization of melanin so that the more potent persulfate can degrade itin solution. Thus, one might conclude that persulfate and peroxide complementeach other in terms of their ability to bleach melanin pigment and therefore tobleach human hair.318 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
Wolfram and Hall [ 147] also isolated several products from the reaction ofalkaline hydrogen peroxide with melanin pigments, including proteinaceousspecies up to 15,000 daltons. These scientists further developed a procedure forthe isolation of melanoprotein and determined the amino acid composition ofmelanoprotein from East Asian hair. They found fewer cystine linkages inmelanoprotein than in whole ﬁber and a larger percentage of ionizable groups—i.e., approximately 35% more dibasic amino acid residues and 15% more diacidicgroups.Wolfram and Albrecht [ 149] concluded that hue differences in hair not onlyresult from chemically different pigments, but also from differences in the degree ofaggregation and dispersion of the eumelanin pigment. Both eumelanin andpheomelanin pigments contain polypeptide chains with similar amino acids asshown by Arakindakshan Menon et al. [ 150]. The red hair melanin contains moresulfur (as 1,4-benzothiazine units) than the brown-black melanins.
There are undoubtedly several similarities with regard to the chemical bleachingof eumelanins and pheomelanins. Wolfram and Albrecht [ 149] suggested thatpheomelanin in hair is more resistant to photodegradation than the brown-blackeumelanins. The more recent study by Hoting and Zimmermann [ 50] demonstratedthat light-brown hair containing a mixture of pheo- and eumelanins is affected byall segments of light including visible light, whereas eumelanins are morephotostable. These scientist examined degradation to the granules gravimetricallyand by examining the polymers by infrared spectroscopy. The aromatic rings ofboth melanic structures are of high electron density, and consequently are bothsensitive to attack by oxidizing agents, as demonstrated for the brown-blackmelanins. The eumelanin in addition provided greater protection to the proteinsof hair than pheomelanin. Takahashi and Nakamura [ 151] studied the
photolightening of red and blonde hair in both UV and visible light and their resultsare described below.5.6.10 Photochemical Degradation of MelaninsPhotochemical degradation of hair proteins occurs primarily near 254–350 nm, theprimary absorbance region of un-pigmented hair as shown by Arnaud [ 58] and byHoting, Zimmerman and Hocker [ 152]. Although several amino acids are degradedby light, the primary degradation occurs at cystine and thioester. Launer [ 60] andInglis and Lennox [ 61] have provided evidence for photochemical degradation toother amino acids including methionine, histidine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, andleucine.The mechanism for photochemical degradation of cystine is believed to involve
both C–S and S–S ﬁssion mechanisms (see the section on photochemical degrada-tion of hair proteins described earlier). Hair pigments function to provide somephotochemical protection to hair proteins, especially at lower wavelengths, whereboth the pigments and the proteins absorb light (254–350 nm). Hair pigments5.6 Hair Pigment Structure and Chemical Oxidation 319
accomplish this protection by absorbing and ﬁltering the impinging radiation anddissipating this energy as heat wherein virtually no damage occurs to the pigments.But above some energy level of excitation the ability of melanin to convert all of itsabsorbed energy to heat fails resulting in damage to its structure and chemicaldegradation.Eumelanin ring opening may result from either ionic (chemical degradation) orfree-radical reaction (photochemical degradation). Slawinska and Slawinski [ 153]suggested that these two mechanistic schemes may have some commonintermediates. The ionic pathway probably begins by nucleophilic attack of theperoxide anion on the o-quinone group. Slawinska and Slawinski suggest thatphotochemical degradation of melanin occurs through a similar peroxideintermediate.The ﬁrst steps in the photochemical degradation of the eumelanin chromophore
probably involves excitation to a radical anion and then attack by the oxygen radicalanion on the o-quinone group, see Fig. 5.31. Ring opening of the six-membered ringindolequinone species then follows.A related scheme may be involved for the photochemical degradation ofpheomelanins.Sarna et al. [ 154] concluded that pheomelanins are very similar to eumelaninswith regard to their susceptibility to photooxidation. However, ArakindakshanMenon et al. [ 150] suggested that pheomelanins are more easily induced to anexcited state than eumelanins. But, Wolfram and Albrecht [ 149] presented evidencethat eumelanins are more sensitive to photochemical or chemical degradation thanpheomelanins. And Hoting et al. [ 152] showed that the pigment of light-brown hairis affected by UV-A, UV-B and visible light, but eumelanins are more stable to lightand provide a greater photoprotective effect.Takahashi and Nakamura [ 151] clariﬁed these seemingly disparate views on the
relative photochemical degradation of pheomelanin and eumelanin by comparingthe relative degradation of the pure pigments and the relative degradation of thepigments in hair. Both visible and UV light degrade pheomelanin in red hair, butOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOO____*HOO_[-H+]*O2_EumelaninMelaninperoxideintermediatePhotochemicalExcitationFig. 5.31 Proposed mechanisms for degradation of melanins [ 153]320 5 Bleaching and Oxidation of Human Hair
eumelanin in the hair ﬁber has been described as being more sensitive [ 149]. On theother hand, studies with isolated pheomelanin vs. eumelanin show that for the purepigments pheomelanin is more sensitive to UV light than eumelanin [ 151]. Thisdifference was proposed by Takahashi and Nakamura who observed the consequencesof light acting directly on the pigments whereas in the ﬁber the light is attenuated byabsorption and reaction with hair proteins producing radicals that react with thepigments.Takahashi and Nakamura [ 151] also observed that blonde hair contains moreeumelanin than pheomelanin and unlike red hair when exposed to UV light does notlighten until it is washed with water after irradiation. These scientists suggested thatthe washing or water effect may involve the hydroxyl free radical which may berequired to be above a certain concentration to decompose eumelanin.5.6.11 Photoprotection of Hair
5.6.11 Photoprotection of HairPande et al. [ 155] demonstrated that hair dyes (both oxidation and semi-permanent)grant a photoprotective effect to hair proteins providing a signiﬁcant decrease incortical damage. This protection shows up in tensile testing and the effect is greaterthe darker the dyes used. Meinert et al. [ 156] examined several commercialantioxidants for their sun protection properties in both pre-sun and after-sun hairproducts. White tea extract and Provitamin A when applied to hair in a pre-sun baseformulation (at 0.05%) and then exposed to UV plus Visible light offered a highertensile breaking stress than the same pre-sun base formulation without antioxidants.The other antioxidants produced either no signiﬁcant difference or a lower tensilevalue. Less color change and lightening of non-dyed hair was observed with thepre-sun base plus White Tea Extract. The damage to the hair proteins was greater athigher radiant ﬂux or lower relative humidity.
Schlosser [ 157] concluded that certain silicones, namely resins like trimethylsi-loxysilicate or propylphenylsilsesquioxane are able to protect dyed hair (permanentdyed hair) from color change induced by UV radiation. However, silicones likedimethiconol/dimethicone did not show such an effect. Schlosser claimed that it ispossible to reduce color facing both by wash-out and from UV radiation by addingsilicones to the formulation of permanent and semi-permanent hair dyes.5.6.12 Summary of Some Physical Properties of Bleached HairThe gross or bulk chemical changes produced in hair by oxidation reactionsincluding bleaching have been described in the previous sections of this Chapter.Details of changes in the breakage, stretching, bending, swelling and other physicalproperties are described in Chaps. 9and10.5.6 Hair Pigment Structure and Chemical Oxidation 321
5.7 Safety Considerations for Hair BleachesThe primary safety concerns with hair bleaches, as with most hair care products,arise from misuse or failure to comply with the usage instructions. Skin irritation,hair breakage, oral toxicity, sensitization and scarring alopecia either have beenreported from use (misuse) of hair bleaches or are mentioned on the warning labelsof these products.Bergfeld [ 158] has reviewed adverse effects of hair cosmetics recorded at theCleveland Clinic Dermatology Department over a 10-year period. Effects attributedto hair bleaches were simple skin irritation and hair breakage. However, Bergfeldreported neither sensitization reactions nor complex toxic symptoms for hairbleaches.Bourgeois-Spinasse [ 159] indicates a few incidents of allergic manifestationscaused by ammonium persulfate powder; however, most hair bleaches today usepotassium persulfate as the primary bleach accelerator. Bergfeld [ 158] reported
permanent hair loss following misuse of hair bleaches and attributed it to scarringalopecia, although Bergfeld did not specify the extent of hair loss observed.Bergfeld concludes that side effects from hair bleaches are minimal, if the con-sumer is aware of damaged hair, any inherent skin disease and complies with theproduct usage instructions.Treatment combinations are oftentimes more damaging to hair than one mightexpect. For example, extensive sunlight exposure in combination with chemicalbleaching or chemical bleaching plus permanent waving must be done very care-fully because of the compound damage provided by these combined treatments.References1.

Chapter 6Interactions of Shampoo and ConditionerIngredients with HairAbstract Shampoos and hair conditioners function primarily at or near the ﬁbersurface. The primary function of shampoos is to remove soils or dirt from the hairsurface, however, hair soils are highly varied from oily to particulate and themechanisms for removal of these different soils also differ. Secondary functionsof shampoos are also varied from conditioning the hair to dandruff control. Withincreasing damage to hair whether by chemical or photochemical reactions or evenby abrasion, the hair surface becomes more hydrophilic and more acidic or anionic
in character thus changing the afﬁnity for different ingredients. Shampoos are oftenperceived as products that do not damage the hair; however damage can occur fromsome shampoos and such damage is described in detail. Different types of testsfrom laboratory to half head to tests on consumers are employed to evaluate thefunctionality of shampoos. These tests are described in detail with contrasts andsome useful conclusions and insights. The sorption of shampoo and conditioningingredients to hair including theories of sorption and diffusion are described indetail. Dandruff including scalp ﬂaking, and skin irritation by surfactants isdescribed in the last part of this chapter.6.1 Introduction
6.1 IntroductionFor this edition, I have summarized some constructive research over the past10 years that has expanded our understanding of the hair ﬁber surface layers andhow these layers change as a function of chemical treatment and by shampooing, allof which is vital to understanding the interactions of shampoos and hair conditioneractions on this important region of the ﬁber. We have learned that both bound andfree lipids are important to the surface layers. With increasing chemical or photo-chemical oxidation the surface and the isoelectric point of the hair decreases. Theseeffects not only decrease hydrophobicity of the surface, they increase the surfaceacidity. At the same time, they damage the surface making it more susceptible tofurther damage by routine hair grooming actions.C.R. Robbins, Chemical and Physical Behavior of Human Hair ,DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-25611-0_6, #Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012329
Our understanding of the structure of the cell membrane complex has alsoincreased. Consequently, we have increased our understanding of how hair ﬁbersare damaged from primary chemical treatments and grooming actions. More spe-ciﬁcally, we’ve learned more about how hair ﬁbers break and split duringgrooming, as described in this chapter and in more detail in Chap. 10. Hopefully,this knowledge will enable us to create new hair products and techniques that willdecrease hair damage and breakage and will provide improved beneﬁts toconsumers.According to legend, the word “shampoo” is derived from a Hindustani wordmeaning “to squeeze”. Shampoos have a long and varied history. However, hairconditioners were not widely used until the mid-twentieth century following theintroduction of “cold” permanent wave type products that exacerbated combingproblems and damaged the hair.The primary function of shampoos is to clean both the hair and the scalp of soils
and dirt. While the primary function of hair conditioners is to make the hair easier tocomb. Secondary beneﬁts such as preventing ﬂyaway hair, improving “hair shine”,protecting the hair from further damage and improving hair feel are also importantfunctions of hair conditioners. Shampoos also have important secondary functionssuch as dandruff control, mildness (baby shampoos), and conditioning (includingboth the primary and the secondary functions of conditioners). Conditioningfunctions have become even more important to shampoos with the use of siliconesand cationic polymers in these products (see Chap. 8). Even fragrance character,impact and preference have created new market segments and become primaryreasons for some consumers to purchase shampoos and conditioners.Shampoos and hair conditioners have generally been perceived as products
that do not damage hair. However, there is increasing evidence that theseproducts, particularly shampoos can contribute to hair damage through abrasive/erosive actions combined with cyclic actions involving bending, compression andextension, both during and after the shampoo process. These actions producedegradation of both the keratin and the important non-keratin components of thehair surface, the cell membrane complex and the cuticle layers. Some new andimportant evidence for the mechanism(s) of these actions has been uncoveredduring the past several years and a detailed discussion of this subject appears inSect. 6.9.1 .For hair conditioning products the principle function involves combability. Easeof combing depends primarily on lubrication of the ﬁber surface. This action is
accomplished by the sorption or binding of lubricating or conditioning ingredientsonto the hair surface. Thus, the most important interactions for both shampoos andconditioners are those that occur at or near the ﬁber surface or near the ﬁrst fewcuticle layers. Of course, if the hair surface is damaged to the extent that the cortexis exposed (near the tip ends) then shampoos and conditioners interact with exposedcortex too.The ﬁrst section of this chapter is concerned with shampoo and conditionerformulations and procedures to make these products. The control of productviscosity and important parameters concerned with product stability for shampoos,330 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
hair conditioners and other types of hair care products are also discussed. Thesecond section describes the different types of soil found on hair; soil origin and theease or difﬁculty in soil removal. Methods to evaluate hair cleaning, the perceptionof hair cleaning, and shampoo lather as it relates to cleaning are then described. Thenext section is concerned with the attachment and the afﬁnity of surfactant/condi-tioning-type molecules to hair including theories of sorption considering bothsurface adsorption and whole-ﬁber studies including ﬁber diffusion. Diffusion orpenetration of chemicals into hair is more concerned with permanent waves, hairstraighteners and hair dyes. However, due to the recent evidence that shampoosover time can damage the non-keratin pathways for entry into hair and more recentevidence that some conditioner-shampoo interactions can damage the cell mem-brane complex, diffusion is also important to shampoos.
The section on damaging effects to hair caused by shampooing and rubbing andstretching actions as occur in hair grooming during shampooing, drying, combingand brushing and styling of hair has been expanded by some new and excitingstudies in this important area. At the end of this chapter is a brief introduction intothe subject of dandruff and scalp diseases including causes and cures followed by abrief introduction into the subject of toxicity with special emphasis on mildness ofsurfactants to skin. This section includes a mathematical model to predict skinirritation by surfactant compositions with examples for a few shampoos.6.2 General Formulation for Shampoos and ConditionersShampoos consist of several types of ingredients generally containing many of thefollowing types of components:– Primary surfactant for cleaning and foaming– Secondary surfactant for foam and/or viscosity enhancement– Viscosity builders: gums, salt, amide
– Solvents/hydrotropes to clarify the product or to lower the cloud point– Conditioning agents– Opaciﬁer for visual effects– Acid or alkali for pH adjustment– Colors (D&C or FD&C colors) for visual effects– Fragrance– Preservative– UV absorber usually for products in a clear package– Specialty active ingredients, e.g., antidandruff agents, conditioning agents, etc.Hair conditioners on the other hand are very different compositionally fromshampoos. These are usually composed of several of the following types ofingredients:6.2 General Formulation for Shampoos and Conditioners 331
– Oily and/or waxy substances including mineral oil, long chain alcohols and/ortriglycerides or other esters including true oils and waxes, silicones and/or fattyacids– Cationic substances consisting of mono-functional quaternary ammoniumcompounds or amines or even polymeric quaternary ammonium compounds oramines– Bridging agents to enhance the adsorption of hydrophobic ingredients to the hair– Viscosity builders– Acid or alkalies for pH adjustment– Colors and PreservativeSpeciﬁc ingredients used in shampoos and conditioners and formulations fordifferent types of products will be described in the next sections in this chapter afterdiscussion of ageing, color stability, microbial stability and viscosity control inshampoos and conditioners.6.2.1 Aging/Temperature Stability
6.2.1 Aging/Temperature StabilityThere are no standard aging or stability tests in the cosmetic industry. Eachcompany or independent formulator has developed its/his or her own set ofstandards to assess product stability to higher temperatures and each uses hightemperature aging as a means to project longer term aging effects. The bestapproach is to test product at multiple temperatures because in some cases, e.g.,some emulsions can be more stable at a higher than at a lower temperature.Freeze thaw or temperature cycling is also important, especially in temperate orcolder climates. This property is important because, we must know if the product isfrozen or taken to a lower temperature will a phase change occur when the productis taken back to room temperature. In other words, will the appearance and productperformance be restored? If precipitation or a permanent phase change occurs atlower temperatures, sometimes such problems can be addressed by improving the
solvency of the system by adding solvents, or even by adding ﬂuoride salts,hydrotropes, urea or other solubilizing additives.The aging conditions of Table 6.1are useful to evaluate a hair care product priorto sale. Obviously, in many cases one cannot afford to wait 1 year for completion ofaging studies to go to market. In such cases, 3–6 months of satisfactory aging underthe above conditions is helpful to make a judgment about product stability, espe-cially if one has additional longer term aging data with related formulations.I also recommend aging the product both in glass and in the actual package thatthe product is to be sold in. If this is done, then if an aging problem arises, one candetermine if the problem is in the formulation itself, or if the formulation is reactingwith the packaging material.332 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
6.2.2 Color StabilityColor instability can be caused by several factors, such as the degradation of coloradditives or through chemical interaction of formula components, or with tracecontaminants of components, or by ultraviolet radiation. This section is concernedwith the latter problem involving stabilization of the system to light radiation.For hair products that are sold in a clear package, light stability is often a majorconcern. For example, exposure to light may cause the dyes in the product to fade,fragrance components may degrade in the presence of light, or other additivesmay fade or decompose when exposed to light radiation. From chemical structures,a common source of this problem is unsaturated groups of a light sensitivecomponent.The easy solution is to use an opaque container; however, this solution may not
be compatible with the marketing plan. An alternative is to add ultraviolet absorbersto the product. These absorb degrading radiation and thus inhibit, retard or preventproduct degradation. Benzophenone-2 or Benzophenone-11 is usually the preferredagent, because of their broad spectrum protection, see Table 6.2:Benzophenone-2 is usually preferred over benzophenone-11 because it is asingle component, whereas benzophenone-11 is a mixture of benzophenone-6,benzophenone-2 and other tetra-substituted benzophenones. Most of these ultravi-olet absorbers can be used in the vicinity of 0.05–0.2% concentrations for protec-tion against degradation by ultraviolet light.6.2.3 Preservation Against Microbial ContaminationPreservation of consumer products against microbial contamination is importantbecause such contamination can lead to product degradation. However, in the worstcase scenario it can lead to the spread of disease. So it is necessary to preserve
consumer products against microbial contamination at the time of manufacture andto ensure the product is preserved for a reasonable time thereafter.Some formulations are inherently more difﬁcult to preserve than others. Ingeneral, the more water in a product the more difﬁcult it is to preserve. In addition,some ingredients are more difﬁcult to preserve against bacterial contamination thanTable 6.1 Useful agingconditions for hair careproductsTemperature aging (/C14C) Time50/C14(122/C14F) 3 months40/C14(104/C14F) 3–6 months25/C14(77/C14F) 1 year25/C14(77/C14F) In sunlight (if clear pkg.)5/C14(40/C14F) 3 months/C020/C14(/C04/C14F) Freeze/thaw (lower temperatures ifneeded)6.2 General Formulation for Shampoos and Conditioners 333
others. For example, plant extracts, vitamins and some nonionic detergents aregenerally more difﬁcult to preserve than other types of ingredients.Formaldehyde, speciﬁcally formalin, is perhaps the single most effective preser-vative for shampoos and conditioners. However, because of its sensitization repu-tation, which actually occurs well above levels used in consumer products, it is notused in many countries. Sensitization by formaldehyde is not a problem if used at0.1% or lower concentration in personal care products. In many cases it is used at0.2% in household products. Most companies avoid the use of formaldehyde inbaby products.One convenient way to classify preservatives is as:– Those that release formaldehyde and those that do not release formaldehydeIn the former group, we have Germaben II, which is one of the more effective
preservatives, Germall 115, Germall II and Glydant. Germaben II is often used inshampoos and conditioners at a level of approximately 0.5% of the product. Thispreservative consists of a mixture of diazolidinyl urea (releases formaldehyde) andparabens in propylene glycol. Germall 115, another effective preservative, isactually imidazolidinyl urea, and can be made more effective by the addition ofparabens. Approximately 0.05% methyl paraben and 0.1% propyl paraben is highlyeffective in the presence of this preservative. Germall II (diazolidinyl urea) isanother effective preservative. It is not as effective as Germaben II, because itdoes not contain parabens as does Germaben II. Glydant is actually DMDMhydantoin and is often used in the vicinity of 0.5% of the product. It is anothereffective preservative. It too is made more effective by the addition of parabens.Among the more commonly used preservatives that do not release formaldehyde
are parabens, Dowicil 200 and Kathon CG. Kathon is effective at extremely lowconcentrations, about 15 ppm. A commonly used mixture of parabens consists of0.1% methyl paraben and 0.7% propyl paraben. This mixture of parabens ismoderately effective alone, but is more effective in combination with otherpreservatives. The European Economic Community (EEC) prohibits the use ofparabens above 0.8%. Parabens like most phenolic preservatives are deactivatedby nonionic surfactants; therefore, parabens should not be used in productscontaining high concentrations of nonionic surfactant like baby shampoos.Dowicil 22, has the CTFA designation, Quaternium-15, and is sometimes usedbetween 0.05% and 0.2% and can be used in combination with parabens to enhanceits preservative capacity. Kathon CG, is a mixture of methyl chloroisothiazolinoneTable 6.2 Preferred agentsfor sunlight protection of hairproductsMost effective wavelength (nm)Benzophenone-2 290–350Benzophenone-4 285

and methyl isothiazolinone, and is another useful preservative for the preservationof cosmetic hair products.Benzyl alcohol, sodium benzoate, sorbic acid and even sequestrants such asEDTA are used as adjuncts for the preservation of hair care products. For example,EDTA is effective against pseudomonas, and should be considered in systemswhere pseudomonas could be a problem, but it should not be considered alonewithout the use of other preservatives.6.2.4 Viscosity Control in Shampoos and Conditioners
To control the viscosity of many shampoos, salt is added to the surfactant system.The interaction between salt and long chain surfactants transforms the smallspherical micelles of the surfactants into larger rod-like or lamellar or even liquidcrystalline “type” structures that increase the viscosity of the liquid shampoo. If oneplots the salt concentration versus the viscosity in such a system, one typically ﬁndsan optimum for the maximum viscosity, see Fig. 6.1. Above this optimum saltconcentration, additional salt decreases the viscosity. In developing such a system
in which viscosity is controlled by salt addition, it is preferable to select theappropriate salt concentration on the ascending part of the viscosity-salt concentra-tion curve. Nevertheless, many light duty liquid products and some shampoos areformulated on the descending part of the curve. The selection of surfactant, amideand other components are critical to viscosity-salt concentration control in such asystem. Furthermore, impurities such as salt contaminants in surfactants must beFig. 6.1 The general relationship of the salt content to the viscosity in surfactant systems(shampoos)6.2 General Formulation for Shampoos and Conditioners 335
carefully controlled to obtain the appropriate viscosity when salt control isemployed.Polymeric gums such as methyl cellulose or hydroxy ethyl cellulose have alsobeen used in shampoos to help control viscosity. Here, the polymers interact withthe surfactants forming even larger more cohesive aggregates of higher viscosity.Alkanolamides interact similarly and are very effective in reducing surfactant headgroup repulsion, thereby allowing even larger and more cohesive aggregates ofhigher viscosity. Other polar surfactants such as betaines and amine oxides caninteract similarly to help increase viscosity of anionic surfactant systems. In suchsystems, the salt concentration is also helpful to viscosity control.Solvents such as propylene glycol, glycerine, carbitols or other alcohols aresometimes used in shampoos to help solubilize or to clarify product or to lowercloud-clear points. Such ingredients often tend to lower product viscosity and aresometimes used for this purpose alone.
6.2.5 Ingredient Structures and Making Proceduresand Formula Examples for Shampoos and Conditioners6.2.5.1 ShampoosThe main primary surfactant used in the United States for shampoos is ammoniumlauryl sulfate, while in many other countries, sodium or ammonium laureth sulfate(with an average of 2 or 3 moles of ethylene oxide) is the current leader. These twosurfactants are used alone or blended together for shampoos because of their ﬁneability to clean sebaceous soil, and perhaps even more importantly, because of theirexcellent lather and viscosity building properties. Sometimes, for product clarityreasons sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate may be used.CH3(CH2)11OSO3 – NH4 + CH3(CH2)11O(CH2CH2O)xSO3 – Na+Ammonium lauryl sulfate                Sodium laureth sulfateAlpha oleﬁn sulfonate has also been used to a limited extent in lower pricedshampoos. This surfactant is represented by the following structures:R-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-SO3 – Na+R-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-SO3 – Na+
R-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-SO3 – Na+R-CH2-CH-CH2-CH2-SO3 – Na+OHR-CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-SO3 – Na+OH336 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
Alpha oleﬁn sulfonate consists of a mixture of the above four surfactants inabout equal quantities. The commercial shampoo material is 14–16 carbon atoms inchain length; therefore, R ¼10–12 carbon atoms. Generally a carbon chain lengthof 12–14 carbon atoms or a coco type distribution of approximately 50% C12 isused for the primary surfactant in shampoos. This chain length provides excellentfoam character, viscosity and cleaning. Longer or shorter chain length surfactantsare used only in specialty systems.Secondary surfactants are used as foam modiﬁers, to enhance cleaning or evenfor viscosity enhancement. The principle secondary surfactants used in shampoosare amides such as cocomonoethanolamide (cocamide MEA) the most commonamide today while other amides have also been used. Betaines are also excellentfoam modiﬁers. Cocamidopropylbetaine is the most popular betaine in shampoos
and is becoming increasingly important as a secondary surfactant. Cocamidopropylsultaine, cocamidopropyldimethylamine oxide and cocoamphoacetate and itsderivatives have also been used as amphoteric surfactants in shampoos.The pH of shampoos is usually adjusted with a common acid such as citric oreven mineral acid. Buffers such as phosphate or other inexpensive materials arealso used for pH control. Preservation against microbial contamination is necessaryand is discussed above. A good cleaning shampoo (Table 6.3) will consist of at leastone primary surfactant, such as an alkyl sulfate or ethoxy sulfate, or even oleﬁnsulfonate, in combination with one or more secondary surfactants. Generally anacid such as citric acid for pH adjustment, a preservative, colors, fragrance andwater are also necessary additives.Baby shampoos (Table 6.4) and some light conditioning shampoos employ
nonionic surfactants such as PEG-80 sorbitan laurate, PEG-20 sorbitan laurate orPEG-20 sorbitan oleate as the primary surfactant and amphoteric surfactants suchas cocoamphocarboxyglycinate or cocoamidopropylhydroxysultaine are used assecondary surfactants to help improve the mildness of anionic surfactants and atthe same time to improve cleaning and lather performance.Table 6.3 Example of a clearcleaning shampooIngredient PercentageSodium laureth sulfate 8Sodium lauryl sulfate 7Cocamide MEA 2Cocamidopropyl betaine 2Glycerin 1Fragrance 0.7Citric acid To desired pHSodium citrate ~0.2Sodium chloride To desired viscosityColors To desired colorSodium benzoate As neededTetrasodium EDTA As neededPreservative (Kathon CG) As neededWater q.s. to 100%6.2 General Formulation for Shampoos and Conditioners 337

An example of a light conditioning shampoo isdescribed in Table 6.5. Opaciﬁers such as ethylene glycol distearate, or soap typeopaciﬁers are often used in conditioning shampoos. These additives provide visualeffects, to promote the perception that something is deposited onto the hair forconditioning.Two in one shampoos can be higher in conditioning than ordinary conditioning
shampoos. These normally contain a water insoluble dispersed silicone as one ofthe conditioning agents. Conditioning shampoos containing water insoluble dis-persed silicones are generally better for conditioning unbleached hair than otherconditioning shampoos. But, silicone conditioning shampoos are not as effectivefor bleached hair because the hydrophobic silicone does not deposit readily onto thehydrophilic surface of bleached hair. The making procedure is also more complexfor silicone containing shampoos and the particle size of the active ingredient iscritical to its effectiveness. This type of system is also difﬁcult to stabilize.The formula below (Table 6.6) is stabilized by a combination of the long chainTable 6.4 Example of a babyshampooIngredient PercentagePEG-80 sorbitan laurate 12Sodium trideceth sulfate 5Lauroamphoglycinate 5Laureth-13 carboxylate 3PEG-150 distearate 1Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine 1Fragrance 1Preservative (Germaben II) 0.5Colors To desired color

acylated agent, e.g., glycol distearate and the thickening gum. Although, Grote et al.[1] describe thickeners as optional components, in our experience with this type ofacylated suspending agent, thickeners are essential to long term product stability.An Introduction into Making Procedures for Clear Shampoos and EmulsionProductsThe simplest making procedure is for a clear solution product, where no gums orwater insoluble solids are in the formulation. In this case, heat is usually notrequired to make the product. This procedure may be considered as consisting offour steps.1. Dissolve the surfactants in water with stirring. Note the order of addition may beimportant. In general, add the foam modiﬁer last.2. Add the fragrance, color solutions and preservative and stir until a uniformsolution is obtained.Table 6.5 Example of a lightconditioning shampooIngredient PercentageAmmonium lauryl sulfate 8Sodium laureth-2 sulfate 6Cocamide DEA 3Polyquaternium-10 1

3. Adjust the pH with either acid or alkalinity.4. Add salt for the ﬁnal viscosity adjustment.Note, whenever possible the ﬁnal step in product manufacture should be viscos-ity adjustment to allow for optimum mixing and for maximum energy conservation.It may be useful or necessary to dissolve the fragrance or an oily component in asmall amount of concentrated surfactant prior to adding it to the aqueous phase.If solid amides are used as foam modiﬁers then heating, above the melt, may benecessary to either dissolve or emulsify such an ingredient. If gums are used, it maybe necessary to dissolve the gum in a small amount of water prior to adding it to thedetergent phase. In any case, when polymeric gums are used one should consult andfollow the gum manufacturer’s directions for dispersing/solubilizing the gum intothe formulation.Most conditioners and conditioning shampoos (such as 2 in 1’s) are oil in water
emulsions and are more complex to make than the simple clear shampoo justdescribed. The following procedure can be used to make most oil in water emulsionproducts:1. Dissolve the water soluble ingredients in deionized water while stirring and heatif necessary. This is part A.2. If necessary, heat the oil soluble components to melt the solids. Theseingredients may be added together or separately. The order of addition is oftencritical. This is Part B. When adding Part B or its components to part A; heat partA to approximately 10/C14above the melting point of the solids. Add Part B or itscomponents to part A while stirring.3. Continue stirring for at least 10–15 min and then add the remaining water.4. Cool and add the preservative, fragrance and colors.5. Adjust the pH and then the viscosity.The speed of agitation, type of mixer, rate of cooling and order of addition are
all important to produce consistent emulsion products that are stable and providehigh performance. In the case of 2 in 1 shampoos with water insoluble silicones,the silicone will generally be added after the fatty components, once the emulsionhas been formed. Three examples of hair conditioner formulations and their makingprocedures are described in the next section. These should provide a better feelfor how to make and formulate emulsion hair products than the general outlineabove.This discussion is obviously a cursory introduction into shampoo and condi-tioner making procedures. For more details on emulsions, their structure, stabilityand formation, see the review by Eccleston [ 2] and the references therein. Foradditional details on the making of shampoos and conditioners, consult formularies[3] and recent literature from cosmetics courses such as offered by “The Society of
Cosmetic Chemists,” and “The Center for Professional Advancement.” For addi-tional details on product compositions, consult references [ 1–3], product ingredientlabels, and the books by Hunting [ 4,5].340 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
6.2.5.2 Hair ConditionersCreme rinses and most hair conditioners are basically compositions containingcationic surfactant in combination with long-chain fatty alcohol or other lipidcomponents. Distearyldimonium chloride, cetrimonium chloride, stearalkoniumchloride and behentrimonium methosulfate are typical cationic surfactants used inmany of today’s hair conditioning products. Amines like dimethyl stearamine orstearamidopropyl dimethylamine are other functional cationics used in theseproducts. Cationic polymers such as Polyquaternium-10 (quaternized cellulosic)and Polyquaternium-7 (co-polymer of diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride andacrylamide) are also used (more in shampoos than in hair conditioners). Care mustbe taken to avoid build-up on hair when formulating with cationic polymers. See thesection on cationic polymers in hair products in Chap. 8and Sect. 6.3.4.8 in thischapter.CH3 CH3 (CH3)2CH3-N+Cl–CH3-(CH2)15-N-CH3+Cl–CH3-(CH2)21-N-CH3 +[CH2-(CH2)16-CH3]2 CH3 CH3-O-SO3–

than for real product performance. An example of such a product is described inTable 6.8.This “kitchen sink” hair conditioner would be made according to the sameprocedure described above for making oil in water emulsion conditioningshampoos. Hype compounds like proteins, placenta extract, vitamins (tocopherol),provitamins (panthenol), etc. that are almost always nonfunctional or less func-tional than a corresponding non-hype material are commonly used in hair condi-tioning products because of the consumer appeal of the ingredient name.Deep conditioners may contain more oils or simply a higher viscosity; see theexample of Table 6.9. To make this product, melt the oil phase, cetyl alcohol andstearamidopropyl dimethyl amine in the presence of mineral oil and propyleneglycol and heat to 80/C14C. Add citric acid to water and heat to 80/C14as the quat is added
to the aqueous phase. Add the oil phase (I) to the aqueous phase and stir for about20 min; then cool and add the preservative, colors and fragrance.Table 6.8 Example of amore complex hairconditionerIngredient PercentageCetyl alcohol 1Stearyl alcohol 1Hydrolyzed animal protein <1Stearamidopropyl dimethyl amine <1Cetearyl alcohol <1Propylene glycol <1Keratin polypeptides <1Aloe <1Chamomile <1Tocopherol <1Panthenol <1Preservative <1Colors <1Fragrance <1Water q.s.

6.3 Cleaning Soils from Hair and Cleaning MechanismsShampoos are formulated under several constraints; because a hair-cleaning systemmust contact the scalp. These constraints include the following: Cleansingingredients must be safe, requiring low toxicity, low sensitization potential, andlow skin and eye irritation potential. Low temperatures (20–44/C14C) are used duringshampooing. Short cleaning or reaction times (minutes) are also employed. Lowsubstantivity of detergent for hair is preferred, except for conditioning, whereadsorption is necessary (see Sect. 6.6). Essentially no degradation of the hairsubstrate by the cleansing system is desirable. The cleansing system should becapable of removing a variety of different soils without complicating interactionsbetween shampoo ingredients and the soils.The most common test criteria used to assess cleaning efﬁciency of shampoo
products relates to the amount of soil left on the hair surface after shampooing.However, the rheological and other physical properties of the soil have recentlybeen shown to also be important. The condition of the hair surface is critical tocleaning. Damaged hair or weathered tip ends tends to reduce the chemical afﬁnityof the hair surface to hydrophobic soils. However, cracks or crevices created bydamaging actions provide cavities to trap soils rendering soil removal more difﬁ-cult. Speciﬁc properties of hair ﬁbers versus assemblies, attributes of the product(fragrance, lather, and viscosity), and the rate of re-soiling are also relevant to theperception of hair-cleaning efﬁcacy. The next section of this chapter is concernedprimarily with the different types of soil found on hair, their origins, and theirremoval by existing surfactant systems.6.3.1 Hair Soils and Detergency MechanismsHair soils may be classiﬁed as one of ﬁve different types:
1. Lipid soils are the primary hair soil and are largely, but not entirely sebaceousmatter. For a more complete description of the chemical composition of seba-ceous soil, see Chap. 2.Table 6.9 Example of a deephair conditionerIngredient PercentagePart I: cetyl alcohol 6.0Stearamidopropyl dimethyl amine 1.5Mineral oil heavy 0.5Propylene glycol 1.0Part II: citric acid 0.2Dicetyldimonium chloride 1.0Germaben II 0.5Fragrance 0.4Water q.s. to 100%6.3 Cleaning Soils from Hair and Cleaning Mechanisms 343
2. Soils from hair products or hair preparations represent another important groupconsisting of a variety of different cationic ingredients, polymers, and lipophilicingredients.3. Metal ions and their derivatives (especially hardness ions) which include cal-cium bridged fatty acids, fatty alcohol sulfates and metals bound to cysteic acidresidues.4. Protein soils are from the skin, but probably in most cases do not constitute aserious soil removal problem.5. Environmental soils vary consisting of particulate matter from air (hydrocarbonsand soot) and minerals from the water supply.6.3.2 Soils from Hair ProductsA variety of different soils from hair products may be found on hair surfaces. It isessential for a good shampoo to remove these soils without complicatinginteractions between the surfactant and the soil. Hair products provide lipid-typesoils, cationic soils, polymeric soils, and metallic ions or fatty acids that can bridgemetallic ions to hair.
metallic ions to hair.Neutral lipids are found in many different types of hair products includingsome conditioners, pomades, men’s hair dressings, etc. Monofunctional cationicingredients such as stearalkonium chloride and cetrimonium chloride are the primaryactive ingredients of creme rinses and other hair-conditioning products. The increasedusage of these products, over the last few decades makes this soil type even morecommon. In addition, use of dialkyl quaternary ammonium ingredients such asdicetyldimonium chloride, distearyldimmonium chloride or even longer chain-lengthquats such as behentrimonium methosulfate are becoming more common in hairconditioner usage.CH3 CH3CH3N-[CH2-(CH2)16-CH3]2+ Cl–CH3-(CH2)15-N-CH3+Cl–Distear yldimmonium chloride Cetrimonium ChlorideCationic polymers such as polymer JR (Polyquaternium-10) a quaternizedcellulosic ingredient [ 6], cationic guar, a quaternized polymer of galactose,
Merquat polymers (Polyquaternium-6 and 7) copolymers of dimethyl diallyl ammo-nium chloride and acrylamide [ 7], and Gafquat polymers (Polyquaternium-11) (copol-ymer of polyvinyl pyrrolidone and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) [ 8]h a v ea l lb e e nused and are currently used in conditioning shampoos, setting lotions, or mousses.(See Chap. 8for additional details regarding cationic polymers used in hair careproducts.)344 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
Neutral and acidic polymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, copolymers ofpolyvinyl pyrrolidone with vinyl acetate, and copolymers of methyl vinyl etherwith half esters of maleic anhydride, etc. are all used in hair styling and hair settingproducts; see Chap. 8for additional details. Fatty acids such as lauric, myristic, orpalmitic have been used in conditioning shampoos, although these are used lessfrequently than in previous years. Fatty acids interact with calcium and magnesiumand other ions of the water supply and deposit on hair. It is believed that at least partof this type of conditioning agent binds to the hair through metal ion bridges [ 9].The greater the water hardness used in washing and rinsing the hair, the larger theamount of deposition of fatty-acid conditioner onto the hair surface (Schebece,private communication) from a shampoo. Thus the primary sources of calcium-bridged fatty acids on hair are conditioning shampoos and soap bar products that
react with metal ions in the water supply. In moderate to high hard-water areas,fatty acids from sebum and free lipids in the surface may also be a source for metalion-bridged fatty acid on the hair ﬁber surface.6.3.3 Environmental SoilsHair is an excellent ion exchange system. Metallic ions may be sorbed to hair inmultiple forms such as lipids, e.g., calcium stearate or as particulates, e.g., metaloxides. Many metallic ions such as copper (+2) [ 10] can adsorb to hair, especiallyafter frequent exposure to swimming pool water. It has been suggested that metallicions such as chromium, nickel, and cobalt may bind to hair from swimming poolwater [ 10] or even from some water supplies. Sorption of metallic ions like calciumor magnesium occurs even from low concentrations in the water supply rather than
from hair products. However, fatty acids present in hair products and soaps enhancethe adsorption of most of these metallic ions to the hair surface, as described above.Alcohol sulfates and even ether sulfates (least affected by metallic ions) can adsorbto the hair with metallic ions, but to less a degree than soaps. Heavy metals such aslead and cadmium have been shown to collect in hair from air pollution [ 11], andother metals like zinc, are available from antidandruff products, and deposit on andin the hair from the zinc pyrithione active ingredient.Other soils that shampoos must remove are proteinaceous matter arising fromthe stratum corneum, sweat, and other environmental sources. We have alreadydescribed metallic ion contamination from the water supply, from swimming pools,and sweat in Chap. 2. In addition, particulate soils from the environment include
hydrocarbons, soot, and metal oxide particles, which should also be at least partiallyremoved by shampoos.6.3 Cleaning Soils from Hair and Cleaning Mechanisms 345
6.3.4 Detergency Mechanisms and Surface Energyof Different Hair Types6.3.4.1 Surface Energy of HairSurface tension is technically the property of a liquid and is an indication of theattractive forces between a liquid and another surface. The surface tension of hairgenerally describes the attractive forces between hair and the surface of water and istechnically the surface energy, see the explanation in Table 6.10 for the units. Horr[14] has reviewed the literature on contact angle measurements of wool ﬁber andreported the surface tension for Merino wool ﬁbers to vary over the range of34/C64 mJ/m2. But this value is high compared with values for human hair andtherefore must be for oxidized wool. In most of these measurements, contact angleswere measured using water as the polar probe and methylene iodide as the non-polar probe liquid.The surface tension/energy of human hair from contact angle measurements
has been shown by Yang [ 15] and others [ 12,13] to vary from below 24 mJ/m2forconditioned hair to above 45 mJ/m2, for damaged hair (not conditioned), see thedata of Table 6.10 and the cited references. Alter and Cook found the values forhuman hair to be higher at low RH and lower at higher RH. For example thesescientists found that virgin hair ﬁbers ranged from 25 to 28 mN/m over the RHrange and bleaching produced somewhat higher values that did not vary from 3 to 9bleaching treatments. Alter and Cook also indicated in their paper that mosthydrocarbon surfaces vary from 22 to 35 mN/m.Kamath, Dansizer and Weigmann of TRI/Princeton [ 12,16] used a liquidmembrane wettability scanning method with water as the polar medium andmethylene iodide as the non-polar medium and calculated surface tensions (numer-ically equal to surface energies) from the equation of Wu [ 16]. From the perspectiveof numerical directionality, the dispersive or non-polar component of the liquid

surface energy ( sLd) of the data from TRI/Princeton is in line with the data fromother laboratories of surface energies determined by other contact angle methods.These data of Table 6.10 show that the hair ﬁber surface of undamaged hair“virgin hair” is very hydrophobic with a low surface energy. Furthermore, the hairﬁber surface becomes more hydrophilic with increasing damage to the ﬁbers(higher surface energy), especially with oxidative damage. This result is consistentwith the fact that oxidation removes 18-methyl eicosanoic acid from the surfaceoxidizing the thioester and disulﬁde to higher oxidation states (primarily sulfonate).It also removes free lipids from the surface. Furthermore these data show thattreatment of bleached hair with conditioners makes the hair surface more hydro-phobic with a lower surface energy. Thus, the cationic part of conditioners binds tothe hair surface by ionic bonds with the hydrophobic tails projecting into the air to
provide a hydrophobic hair surface. Because hair conditioners are usuallyformulated with lipids like fatty alcohols and silicones these most likely bind tothe hydrophobic tail of the cationics and make the hair surface even morehydrophobic.6.3.4.2 Detergency MechanismsAlthough mechanical action is involved in cleaning hair, as a ﬁrst approximationmechanical action during shampooing may be assumed to be constant for any givenperson. Therefore, detergency mechanisms are the most viable approach to improvehair cleaning. Detergency mechanisms [ 17] generally consider soils as either oily(liquid soils) or particulate (solid soils). Oily soils are the most common hair soil andappear as oily ﬁlms of varying thickness and distribution on the hair ﬁber surface, seeFig.6.2. The removal of oily soils involves diffusion of water to the soil-ﬁber interface
and roll-up of the soil. Roll-up generally determines the rate of soil removal, althoughsolubilization, emulsiﬁcation, and soil penetration are also important. Roll-up of oil ona ﬁber surface is caused by interfacial tensions of (oil on ﬁber) £fo, (water on ﬁber) £ fw,Fig. 6.2 Scanning electron micrographs hair ﬁber surfaces illustrating sebaceous soil ( Right )versus a ﬁber cleaned with sodium lauryl sulfate solution ( Left)6.3 Cleaning Soils from Hair and Cleaning Mechanisms 347
and between (oil and water) £ ow. When the combination of these interfacial tensions Ris positive in the expression below the oily soil rolls-up:R¼£fo/C0£fwþ£ow/C2cos/C11In other words, to produce oily soil roll-up, the detergent must make the ﬁbersurface more hydrophilic [ 17]. Thus, the removal of lipid soil from hair isdominated by the hydrophilicity of the ﬁber surface. Anything that can be done tomake the ﬁber surface more hydrophilic, such as bleaching or washing with anionicsurfactants in water, should facilitate oily soil removal. This is one of the reasonswhy damaged hair, which is more hydrophilic at the surface than virgin hair(Table 6.10) is so sensitive to oil removal and often appears very dry (which isactually less oily rather than containing less water) after shampooing.Since hair is more damaged, that is it contains less lipid and it is more oxidized at
the tip ends than at the root ends, the ﬁbers will be more hydrophilic at the tip ends[16]. Thus, surface bound hydrophobic soils should be more easily removed fromthe tips. This fact helps to account for the phenomenon of dry tips and oily roots onthe same person. On the other hand, weathered tip ends of hair will have moreraised scales and cracks and crevices to trap soils rendering them more difﬁcult toremove from these aspirates on the ﬁbers.Solubilization of hydrophobic soils is perhaps equally important to roll-up forshampoo cleaning. Because of dilution with water, shampoos are generally used at1–4% surfactant concentration, well above the critical micelle concentration (cmc).In addition, shampoos are actually mixed surfactant systems consisting of mixedmicelles reducing the cmc of the system even further. Thus hydrophobic soils ofsebum and other oily soils can be solubilized by being incorporated into the
structure of the micelles of shampoos. Solubilization is a very important mechanismfor cleaning oily soils from hair during the shampoo process.Particulate soils arise from dust, dirt, soot, hydrocarbons, metal oxides and evenfrom hair products that deposit materials such as silicas or aluminas or titaniumoxide from about 1 mm to less than 0.1 mm particle size, see Fig. 6.3. The removal ofparticulate soil is not controlled by the hydrophilicity of the ﬁber surface. Particu-late soil removal depends on the bonding of the particle to the surface, the locationof the particle [ 17], and the size of the particle. Particle size is perhaps the mostcritical variable for the removal of particulates. As the particle size decreases thearea of contact with the ﬁber surface increases making it more difﬁcult to remove.At particle sizes of less than 0.1 mm, it is very difﬁcult to remove material from hairsurfaces by ordinary shampooing [ 18]. When the soil particle consists of non-polar
components, its adhesion depends mainly on Van der Waals forces. Therefore, withwaxes or polymeric resins, the molecular size and shape are important to theirremoval. Unless unusually high molecular sizes are involved, the removal of suchsoils is oftentimes easier than for cationic polymers where adhesive bindingincludes a combination of ionic and Van der Waals forces.348 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
When hair soils ﬁt into these two distinct classes (oily or particulate) themechanism for their removal is easy to understand. However, other soils (e.g.,conditioners containing cationic surfactant plus oily substances or some plasticizedresins) are intermediate in classiﬁcation and their removal probably involves eithera combination of mechanisms or a more complicated cleaning mechanism.6.3.4.3 Methods to Evaluate Clean HairSeveral methods have been described to evaluate the ability of different shampoosor detergents to clean soil from the hair [ 10,19–27]. Most of these methods havebeen developed to evaluate the removal of lipid soil from the hair [ 19,21,22].Some of these methods are soil speciﬁc [ 21] or are more sensitive with speciﬁc soiltypes [ 24], while others work for most soils [ 23].Hair cleaning methods may be classiﬁed according to the following categories:
chemical and physical properties, microscopic methods, or subjective or sensoryevaluation procedures. Chemical or physical methods may involve either directanalysis of the hair itself [ 23] or analysis of hair extracts [ 20,21]. For direct analysisof hair, chemical methods such as ESCA (XPS) [ 25] or infrared spectroscopy mayFig. 6.3 Particulates on the surface of hair ﬁbers.

be used. Physical methods such as ﬁber friction [ 24] or light scattering [ 23]o rexamination of inter-ﬁber spaces, on the other hand, are less soil-speciﬁc thanchemical methods and offer the ability to look at a variety of soil types, butsometimes these methods are less discriminating.Microscopic methods have been used to evaluate hair cleanliness [ 20]. However,sensory evaluation of hair greasiness on hair swatches [ 26] and subjective assess-ments from half-head and consumer tests are also useful. The latter evaluations arein a sense the “ﬁnal word” in the estimation of cleanliness by shampoos. Mostprocedures involve evaluation of either single soils (primarily hair lipid) or short-term effects of different products. One area of concern that has received relativelylittle attention is long-term effects that might result from gradual buildup or fromgradual interactions between different hair products such as silicone containing
products or between hair lipid and different hair products. This area will becomeincreasingly important for future research for shampoos as new substantive condi-tioning agents are discovered and employed.6.3.4.4 Cleaning Efﬁciency of ShampoosTo evaluate shampoo efﬁciency, one must consider the different soil types sepa-rately and then together. We must also learn to distinguish between cleaning soilfrom the hair and the deposition of ingredients from the shampoo formulation itself.6.3.4.5 Cleaning Lipid Soil from HairFor efﬁciency in removing lipid soil from hair, the literature does not provide aconsensus. For example, Shaw [ 20] concludes that a one-step application of anionicshampoo removes essentially all the hair-surface lipid and therefore differences incleaning efﬁciencies that are cited (for different surfactants [ 20]) reﬂect differencesin the amount of “internal hair lipid” removed. To support this conclusion, Shaw
cites results from scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of hair washed withanionic surfactant (monoethanolamine lauryl sulfate) compared with SEMphotographs of hair washed with the solvent ether (see Fig. 6.2). In addition,Shaw cites in vitro studies showing that various shampoos remove 99% of anartiﬁcial lipid mixture deposited on the hair.Robbins [ 28] independently arrived at a similar “but not exactly the sameconclusion” suggesting that shampoo surfactants in a normal two step shampoooperation are very effective in removing “surface” lipid deposits; but not aseffective for removing free lipids that are bound within the interstices of 18-MEA
on the surface. Furthermore, because of their limited penetration into hair,shampoos are not effective for removing much internal lipid. In addition, thereare data to support the conclusion that free lipids are an integral part of the hairsurface and should not be completely removed from the surface, see the section ofChap. 2entitled, Surface Lipids of Human Hair including Table 2.15.350 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
Table 6.11 offers some evidence for the effectiveness of current shampoos forremoving a sebaceous-type soil from wool fabric in moderately soft water (80 ppmhardness). These data show that a cocomonoglyceride sulfate (CMGS) shampoo atonly 5% concentration (5% shampoo and l% A.I.) under these laboratory conditionsapproaches the efﬁciency of boiling chloroform in a 4 h soxhlet extraction forremoving lipid soil (Spangler synthetic sebum, see Chap. 2) from wool swatches.On the other hand, the soap containing shampoo of Table 6.11 is not very effectivein removing this lipid from hair. The normal usage concentration of shampoos is20–25%. The solution to hair ratio in normal shampoo usage is lower than in thisexperiment, however, this variable probably does not make a substantive differ-ence. Wool swatches were used in this experiment instead of hair, because mostshampoos are too effective to provide distinctions in removing sebum from hairunder these conditions.
under these conditions.Another experiment involved comparing the total amount of extractable lipidfrom hair after washing with two different shampoos in a half-head test. Theseshampoos were selected because they displayed differences in their ability toremove sebum from hair in the laboratory. This experiment was performed twice,using ﬁve subjects per test. Both on-head tests show no signiﬁcant difference in theamount of extractable hair lipid after shampooing the hair with these two shampoos(see Table 6.12). This result suggests that the laboratory test is more sensitive fordetecting differences in sebum removal than the half-head test. It also suggests thatboth shampoos are removing most of the surface hair lipid deposits in the on-headprocedure.If large differences in cleaning efﬁciency really exist between most shampoos
in consumer usage, then other variables such as lather or fragrance would not likelyhave a large impact on the consumer’s assessment of cleaning efﬁciency. However,it is well known that variables such as fragrance or lather do have a large impacton the consumers’ perception of cleaning efﬁciency by different shampoos,see Sect. 6.4. See the subsection 6.4.3.3. under Sect. 6.4. The above results areTable 6.11 Shampoo versus chloroform extraction of wool fabric% Shampoo % Sebum removedaCMGS formula Soap ctg. formula0.5 63 181.0 76 322.0 86 535.0 91 77Test procedure: Wool swatches were soiled with synthetic sebum and weighed to determine theamount of soil deposited. The swatches were then washed in a tergitometer with CMGS and soapcontaining (dry hair) shampoos at varying concentrations. The swatches contained approximately10% sebum. The temperature was 105–110/C14F, time was 30 s, and a 200/1 solution to wool ratioand 2–30 s water rinsings was used
and 2–30 s water rinsings was usedaThese percentage values were obtained by extracting these same wool swatches in boilingchloroform for 4 h in a soxhlet apparatus after shampooing and comparing the residue weightversus total soil deposited. So for practical purposes, boiling chloroform for 4 h provides 100%sebum removal6.3 Cleaning Soils from Hair and Cleaning Mechanisms 351
consistent with the conclusion that current shampoos are very efﬁcient for cleaning“surface” lipid deposits from the hair.Statements contrary to the conclusions of Shaw and Robbins exist in thescientiﬁc literature. Schuster and Thody [ 29] state that “shampooing” with sodiumlauryl sulfate is an ineffective means of removing hair lipid. Thompson et al. [ 21]report from in vitro testing that anionic surfactants remove polar components ofsebum more readily than nonpolar components (parafﬁn waxes); the implicationbeing that nonpolar components of sebum are not efﬁciently removed from hair bynormal anionic shampoos. Clarke et al. [ 30] concluded that laureth-2 sulfate is one
of the most effective surfactants for removing virtually all sebaceous componentsfrom hair. Lauryl sulfate is not as effective for removing fatty acids in the presenceof water hardness. It is nevertheless, highly effective for removing other sebaceouscomponents from hair. Shorter chain-length surfactants (less than C12) are, asexpected, less effective for removing lipid components from hair.The effect of temperature on the selective removal of sebum components fromhair was also compared by Clarke et al. [ 31] for sodium laureth-2 sulfate andammonium lauryl sulfate. Laureth sulfate was found to be the more effectivedetergent at both 21/C14C (70/C14F) and 43/C14C (110/C14F). Surfactant efﬁcacy decreasedwith temperature providing a slightly greater selectivity in component removal atthe higher temperature than at the lower temperature.The ability of anionic surfactants to remove hair lipid is dependent on surfactant
structure, concentration, agitation, temperature, time, and other variables includingother soils on the hair. In addition, detergents like sodium lauryl sulfate do notpenetrate rapidly into hair and should not be expected to remove the same amountof lipid from hair at the same rate as a penetrating lipid solvent like ethanol.Under optimum conditions such as in vivo shampooing, anionic surfactants arenearly as effective as chloroform or ether (non-penetrating lipid solvents) forremoving deposited surface lipid. In most of the tests described in the literature,care was taken to exclude conditioning products, containing cationics and cationicpolymers or silicones, setting resins, and hard water to provide more control overTable 6.12 Sebum on hair clippings and lipids after half-head shampooing with shampoos ofdifferent laboratory sebum removing potentialFormula % Sebumaremoval in labAmount lipidbextractedusing alcohol (4 h)Test #1 TEALS liquid 54 3.0Tas-6-1065 82 3.0

The lipid extract is expressed as apercentage of the dry weight of the hair for an average of triplicate determinations352 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
the experiments. Obviously these variables must be included before we can arrive ata full understanding and a consensus about the efﬁciency of anionic shampoos forcleaning hair lipids from the hair surface.Other soils have not been studied so extensively. However, Robbins et al. [ 32]have shown that C12 alkyl sulfates or alkyl ether sulfates, the traditional shampoosurfactants, do not remove cationic surfactants from hair as effectively as shorterchain length surfactants. Shorter chain length anionics such as deceth-2 sulfate ismore effective for removing cationics than lauryl or laureth sulfates. In addition,alkyl ether sulfates are more effective for removing fatty acid soils in the presenceof water hardness than alkyl sulfates [ 32]. These results support the rationale forusing mixed surfactant systems for the most effective way to remove a mixture ofhair soils.6.3.4.6 Surface Versus Internal LipidHuman hair contains both surface lipid and internal lipid, and these lipids are
incorporated into lipid layers and bound to the hair or surface deposits assummarized in Chap. 2. 18-MEA is the primary lipid on the hair ﬁber surface,and it is covalently bound to underlying proteins through thioester linkages [ 33].However, there is generally an appreciable amount of free lipid (not covalentlybound) in the surface (Chap. 2). Thus, there will be more free lipid in the surface,closer to the roots than the tips, and there will be more free lipid the longer the timeinterval between shampooing and with less hair damage. Support for these conclu-sion stems from deﬁning the hair surface as the top 3–5 nm and using X-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy to measure the amount of free lipid in this surface viaC/N analyses. Details are described in Chap. 2.Some of the internal lipid is structural material and part of this structural lipid in
the cuticle layers is covalently bound, while some is non-covalently bound byweaker attractive forces (free lipid). Covalently bound lipids cannot be removedchemically by shampoos or lipid solvents, but abrasive actions of shampoos canbreak and thus remove large particles of the hair surface containing structural lipids.But, part of the non-covalently bound lipids can be removed by shampoos.Supporting this conclusion is the increasing evidence that structural lipid, probablypart of the beta layers of the cell membrane complex, can be removed over time byshampooing [ 34,35], see Chap. 1. Furthermore, some cationic-anionic interactionsillustrate cell membrane complex damage. These and analogous interactions likelylead to loss of inert Beta layer material. This effect is described in more detail laterin this chapter.When the hair has not been shampooed for several days, the total amount of lipid
extractable from “oily” hair by a hair swelling solvent like ethanol can be as high as9% of the weight of the hair (Jacob, private communication). A sizable fraction ofthe “total” hair lipid is not removed by shampooing or by extraction with a non-penetrating, low-boiling lipid solvent like ether. We have obtained as high as 4.2%ethanol extractable matter from hair cut from heads immediately after shampooing6.3 Cleaning Soils from Hair and Cleaning Mechanisms 353
two times with a triethanol ammonium lauryl sulfate (TEALS) shampoo (Jacob,private communication) (see Table 6.12).Curry and Golding [ 36] concluded that the rate of extraction of lipid from hair bysolvents is very slow. Even after 100 Soxhlet cycles with ether (four successiveextractions), a signiﬁcant amount of lipid can be obtained by additional extraction.As indicated before, Shaw [ 20], using SEM techniques, suggested that washing hairwith either ether or shampoos in a one-step application removes virtually the entiresurface “free” lipid from hair and that differences in cleaning efﬁciencies ofsurfactants relate to the amounts of internal hair lipid removed. Recent XPS datashows that shampooing does remove some free lipid from the surface of hair, buteven after shampooing, an appreciable amount of free lipid remains in the surfacelayers and it is likely bound in the interstices of 18-MEA, see Chap. 2. Shaw found
that one-step shampooing removes approximately 50% of the ether extractablematter.Koch et al. [ 9] reported that repeat shampooing removes 70–90% of the ether-extactable lipid, and that enzymatic hydrolysis of hair after ether extraction,followed by extraction of the residual membranes yields “internal lipid.” Kochfound the composition of this internal lipid to be somewhat similar to that of surfacehair lipid, see Chaps. 1and2. Koch therefore concluded that internal lipid of hairmust in part originate from the sebaceous glands (see the section entitled CellMembrane Complex of Chap. 1).See Chap. 2for a description of the techniques used to extract covalently bound
lipids and free lipids and internal and external lipid from the hair. Koch suggestedthat external lipid may be extracted by boiling ether saturated with water followedby ethereal hydrochloric acid. The former solvent removes neutral surface lipid; thelatter solvent removes calcium-bridged fatty acids attached to the hair surface.He suggested that surface lipid so deﬁned is removed under conditions that simulatethe “strongest shampooing conditions imaginable.”This deﬁnition of surface lipid by Koch probably provides a high estimate forsurface hair lipid. Another deﬁnition is the amount of lipid removed by a doubleapplication of an anionic surfactant. This latter deﬁnition probably provides a morerealistic estimate for the practical “removable” surface hair lipid. However, if oneaccepts this latter deﬁnition, then the amount of lipid left in hair after shampooingrepresents internal lipid and may be estimated by solvent extraction (ethanol) aftershampooing.
Capablanca and Watt [ 37] examined wool ﬁber that had been washed withdetergent and extracted with various solvents using a streaming potential methodto estimate the effect of free lipid (non-covalently bound) on the isoelectric point ofwool ﬁber. These scientists found that the surfactant washed wool (containing themost free lipid) provided an isoelectric point of 3.3 while the most effective lipidsolvent extracted hair provided an isoelectric point of 4.5. These data show that thetrue isoelectric point of the surface hair proteins is close to 4.5 and that free lipidwhich contains fatty acids is an important and essential component of the surface ofanimal hairs. So, the more free lipid present in these surface layers, the lower theisoelectric point of the keratin ﬁbers. Therefore, all of the free lipid is not totally354 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
removed from the surface layers by shampooing and this lipid is important to theisoelectric point and to the adsorption of ingredients onto human hair and to otherimportant surface properties of hair.Table 6.13 summarizes data from an experiment conducted to determine if thequantity of internal hair lipid differs in dry (chemically unaltered hair) versus oily(chemically unaltered) hair. Immediately after shampooing two times with aTEALS shampoo, hair clippings were taken from three oily-haired panelists andthree dry-haired panelists and extracted with boiling ethanol. The results suggestedsimilar quantities of internal hair lipid in these six hair samples.Test Procedure: Six panelists were selected for this test, three having dry hairand three oily hair, as judged by both beauticians and the panelists themselves. Hairclippings were taken from heads after shampooing with a TEALS shampoo, usingthe usual two-step application procedure. The clippings were combined from all
three dry-hair and all three oily-hair panelists. They were randomized into threereplicates (sets) per sample, and Soxhlet extracted in triplicate for 4 h with ethanol.This test result suggests that the amount of internal lipid in dry and oily hair isvirtually identical. Therefore, the primary differences between dry and oily hairlipid are in the amount and the composition of the surface lipids. In summary, thecurrent literature suggests that human hair contains lipid at or near its surface andthat it also contains internal lipid. The surface lipid provides many of the negativephysical characteristics attributed to oily (greasy) hair, while some of the interior
lipid will slowly diffuse to the surface upon successive washings (shampooing) orextractions. Furthermore, this internal hair lipid is similar (but not exactly the same)in composition to the external hair lipid. Hair also contains bound or structuralinternal lipid that is presumably resistant to shampooing. Further details on thecomposition of hair lipid are described in Chaps. 1and2.6.3.4.7 The Transport of Hair LipidAfter shampooing, the Free Lipid content of the surface layers of hair has beenconsiderably reduced, but it is still at a signiﬁcant level. As time passes fromshampooing, sebum (produced by the sebaceous glands) and epidermal lipid (pro-duced by the cells of the horny layer of the scalp) are transferred to the hair becauseof its greater surface area and absorptive capacity. Creeping of sebum along the hairhas been suggested by Gloor [ 38], although Eberhardt [ 39] concluded that creeping
does not occur along single hair ﬁbers. Eberhardt suggests that transport occursTable 6.13 Amount of hairlipid in oily versus dry hairafter shampooingAverage amount of lipid recoveredWeight (g) % Weight of hairDry hair 0.164 3.6Oily hair 0.161 3.66.3 Cleaning Soils from Hair and Cleaning Mechanisms 355
primarily by mechanical means such as by contact of hair with scalp (pillows andhats), rubbing (combing and brushing), and hair-on-hair contact.Distribution of sebum along the ﬁbers by combing and brushing is very impor-tant, and wicking as occurs in textile assemblies is most likely also involved[40,41]. The net result is that the rate of accumulation of lipid is fastest for oilyhair and after the lipid accumulates, beyond a given level, it interferes with theappearance and overall aesthetics of the hair causing ﬁbers to clump or to adheretogether, producing the appearance of limp hair.The composition of the lipid soil itself may inﬂuence its transport, becauseingredients that either lowers the surface tension of the sebum or increases itsﬂuid nature (makes it less viscous) can facilitate transport and even increase theperception of oiliness. In addition, other ingredients left behind on the hair surface
such as conditioning agents, may exacerbate oiliness in an analogous manner.Hair characteristics such as ﬁneness, degree of curvature, and length are alsorelevant to the transport of lipid and to the inﬂuence of lipid on hair assemblyproperties. For example, ﬁne, straight hair will provide optimum characteristics fortransport of sebum. This type of hair will also provide the maximum amount of hairclumping by a given amount of lipid, thus it will appear oilier and more limp thancurly hair. For example, curly-coarse hair will tend to inhibit transport and also tominimize the inﬂuence of tress clumping and compacting. Among all hairproperties, increasing ﬁber curvature provides the greatest inﬂuence against thecohesive forces of hair lipid and the resultant compacting (limpness) of ﬁbers inassemblies such as tresses [ 42].6.3.4.8 Cationic SoilsDye staining tests [ 43] on wool fabric or hair swatches (containing cationic) and
ESCA studies on hair containing mono-functional cationic surfactant [ 25] showthat a single washing of hair with an anionic detergent does not remove all of thequaternary ammonium compound from hair. Radiotracer studies of cotton fabriccontaining presorbed sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) by Hsing et al. [ 44] indicated thatSLS sorbs to the fabric in an equimolar quantity to the deposited quaternaryammonium compound. Robbins et al. [ 45] found that by presorbing anionic surfac-tant (SLS) to hair and then treating it with cationic (dodecyltrimonium bromide),the presorbed anionic enhanced the adsorption of the cationic to the hair. Theseresults suggest that mono-functional cationics are resistant to removal by anionicsurfactant because they form adsorption complexes on hair and these have thepotential to build up on hair.Robbins et al. [ 32] determined that washing mono-functional cationic surfactants
like cetrimonium chloride from hair treated with a conditioner using normal alkylsulfates or alcohol ether sulfates does not remove all of the cationic from the hair. Inaddition, the anionic detergent can build up with the cationic. However this type ofbuild up generally levels after ﬁve to six treatments. Shorter chain length surfactantslike deceth-2 or -3 ether sulfate do not build up in the same manner. In addition, hair356 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
matting has been reported in vivo and attributed by Dawber and Calnan [ 46] to theadsorption of cetrimonium bromide on hair.Certain cationic polymers have also been reported to build up on hair [ 8]. Evenlow-charge-density cationic polymers like polymer JR have been reported to beresistant to removal from hair surfaces by anionic surfactant [ 47,48]. For example,in one study 3% sodium lauryl sulfate, after 1 min, removed 50% of the polymer JRfrom the hair and nearly 70% in 30 min. However, some strongly bound cationicpolymer was still attached to the hair and resistant to removal by anionic surfactantafter 30 min.Hannah et al. [ 48] showed that polymer JR deposits on hair in the presence ofexcess sodium lauryl sulfate. This deposited complex is highly substantive to hairand resists removal by either water or 3% sodium lauryl sulfate. Therefore, adsorp-tion complexes of polymeric cations also resist shampooing from hair.
Polyethyleneimine, a high charge density cationic polymer, is even morestrongly bound to hair than polymer JR, and has been shown to be resistant toremoval by anionic surfactant [ 49]. For example, PEI-600 was sorbed onto hair andtested for desorption toward a 10% shampoo system. After 30 min, less than 20% ofthe PEI was removed and only about 30% PEI was removed after 6 h. For additionaldetails on the adsorption and removal of cationic polymers from hair, see Chap. 8andthe references therein.Lipid soils or deposits are more readily removed from hair surfaces by normalshampooing. However, the foregoing results clearly show that cationic soils areresistant to removal by anionic surfactant, and it appears that anionic surfactantsare not capable of completely removing high-charge-density cationic polymersfrom hair.6.3.4.9 Other SoilsThe original hair spray lacquers of the 1950s were more difﬁcult to remove from
hair than the anionic and neutral polymers of today’s hair-setting products. How-ever, no systematic study of the ease or difﬁculty in removing these ingredientsfrom hair could be found in the scientiﬁc literature. Gloor [ 50] examined theinﬂuence of hair spray on re-oiling; however, no systematic study of the effectsof hair spray on the ease of removal of hair lipid has been reported.Calcium-bridged fatty acid may be deposited onto hair even in shampooscontaining anionic surfactant such as ammonium lauryl sulfate. In addition, cal-cium has been shown by Smart et al. [ 51] to concentrate in the cuticle and themedulla and at much higher levels in oxidized hair versus chemically untreatedhair. It is also well known that acid rinses may be used to remove calcium-bridged
fatty acid from hair, and anionic sulfate surfactants appear to remove some fattyacid deposits from hair. However, divalent copper (cupric ion) adsorbs to hair and isreported to be resistant to removal by anionic surfactant [ 10].Published literature regarding the efﬁcacy of anionic surfactant systemsfor removing particulate soils such as soot, hydrocarbons, etc. could not be found.6.3 Cleaning Soils from Hair and Cleaning Mechanisms 357
As indicated earlier, as particle size decreases below about 1 mm, the resistance toremoval should increase and the particles will become increasingly difﬁcult toremove. Particles below 0.1 mm will be very difﬁcult to remove [ 18].6.3.4.10 Rate of Re-Oiling of HairBreuer [ 52] described the kinetics for re-oiling of hair in terms of sebum productionand sebum removal. He derived the following expression to describe the rate ofre-oiling:m¼AK=1/C0e/C0Kt/C0/C1where m ¼amount of sebum on the hair (at any time after cleaning), t ¼time aftercleaning (min), A ¼production rate of sebum (12.5 /C2105ng/min), and K ¼rateconstant for sebum removal.Using experimental data, the above expression was solved numerically byBreuer suggesting that in a 4 day period; approximately 65% of the sebum that isproduced is lost from the head by rubbing against objects such as pillows, combs orbrushes. Breuer concluded that shampoo and post-shampoo treatments inﬂuence
the re-oiling rate of hair. As indicated earlier, anionic surfactants alone do notstimulate the rate of re-fatting [ 20], although antidandruff agents have been shownto affect sebum production. For example, selenium sulﬁde has been reported toincrease the rate of sebum production [ 19,53], zinc pyrithione [ 19] and climbasole,two other antidandruff agents have also been shown to behave similarly by increas-ing hair greasiness [ 19]. Ketoconazole on the other hand has been shown todecrease the rate of sebum production [ 53].6.4 Perceptions in Cleaning Hair and SubjectiveTesting of ShampoosWith the advent of 2 in 1 shampoos, a new era was begun in cosmetic science.Differences in the performance between 2 in 1 conditioning shampoos can berelatively large. These effects can be detected in laboratory tests, in half headtests, and even in consumer tests on cell sizes smaller than N ¼100. To thecosmetic scientist, this is a positive situation. We could now turn our attention to
real product performance for conditioning shampoos and work to create productsthat are really better, not only in the laboratory, but products that consumers will seeas better. This situation was created by a combination of new technology andconsumers becoming willing to accept different standards of performance forshampoos. I believe this same situation exists for other opportunities in hair carein the future, e.g., hair body or hair thickening shampoos.358 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
The situation is not as clear for cleaning shampoos. However, with the new soilsthat we are leaving behind on hair for superior conditioning, body and style control,perhaps new performance opportunities in hair cleaning will also become feasiblein the future. Nevertheless, the following discussion is useful for all product typeswhen the differences between real product performances become relatively small, asituation that could occur for 2 in 1 shampoos or high performance conditioningshampoos in the twenty-ﬁrst century.Questions regarding the removal of sebaceous soil and other soils from hair arefundamental to the action of shampoos; however, another fundamental question is:Which is more important to the sale of shampoos—the actual abilities of differentshampoos to remove soil from hair, or factors relating to the perception of cleaningsuch as lather, viscosity, fragrance, etc.? Laboratory or in vitro tests are critical to
provide an understanding of shampoo behavior. However, subjective tests areultimately involved to evaluate the consumer’s response to the total product. Thenext section describes some of the more common subjective tests used in shampoodevelopment and raises some important questions.6.4.1 Shampoo PerformanceThe evaluation of overall shampoo performance is determined by the hair effectsthat the product provides and by the properties of the shampoo itself (properties thatdo not directly inﬂuence hair effects, but are important to the consumer). A helpfuldistinction deﬁnes hair effects as all performance attributes of the shampooevaluated after rinsing, and shampoo properties as all performance attributesnoted or evaluated prior to and during the rinse step.6.4.2 Hair Effects and Discernibility Versus Perception
For this discussion, discernibility is considered as the objective (not necessarilynumerical) ability of the users of a product to isolate and to discriminate betweeneffects on hair without being inﬂuenced by related stimuli such as fragrance, lather,viscosity, etc. Perception on the other hand is the subjective response to a hairproperty, and this response is inﬂuenced by all related stimuli including the hairproperty itself, advertising and label copy, and all related shampoo properties.The question of whether or not a hair effect is discernible to a given percentageof consumers is relevant to the understanding of the perception of a product and to
understanding why a product does or does not sell well. However, its answer willoften be in doubt. This is because it is difﬁcult for consumers or panelists to beobjective and to isolate and measure performance properties without beinginﬂuenced by other product properties. For pragmatic (ﬁnancial) reasons, insufﬁ-cient blind tests are generally conducted to determine discernibility, because the6.4 Perceptions in Cleaning Hair and Subjective Testing of Shampoos 359
bottom line is sales not objective understanding. It is for this reason that manyexecutives question the relevance of testing performance in isolation. Thus, judg-ment is involved to answer questions of discernibility and subjectivism ofteninterferes in its evaluation and interpretation.6.4.3 Different Tests to Evaluate Shampoo PerformanceSome of this author’s conclusions relevant to different types of shampoo (product)tests are described below. In general, objective discernibility of a hair effectbecomes progressively less important as one proceeds from laboratory to salestests. This is because subjective perceptions involving psychologically relatedstimuli become more important as one moves from the laboratory (where experi-mental control isolates discernibility from perception) to sales testing.6.4.3.1 Laboratory TestsCertain laboratory tests (tress combing, ﬁber friction, light scattering, sebumremoving ability, etc.) can be more sensitive than consumer’s evaluations (see
Sect. 6.3.4.3 and Chap. 9). However, the most severe constraint with laboratorytesting is that laboratory measurements are often only a portion of the relatedconsumer assessment. For example, ﬁber friction is only a small part of how thehair feels to a consumer or how easily her or his hair combs and hair combing isonly a portion of hair conditioning to consumers.6.4.3.2 Half-Head Tests with Evaluations by Trained CosmetologistsThese tests are side-by-side comparisons and can be more precise than mostassessments by consumers (who rely on memory comparisons) for discerningmost important hair effects. It can also be argued that half-head tests generallyinvolve short-term effects, and they may be misleading with regard to long-termeffects.6.4.3.3 Blind Product TestsThe standard 2-week crossover blind product test with a large panel size (N ~ 300) is
a relatively sensitive means for discerning whether or not product differences existbetween different shampoos. On the other hand, long-term effects due to buildup orproduct interactions may be either not detected or further complicated by the 2-weekcrossover design. One further difﬁculty, even in short-term evaluations, is in under-standing the meaning of the differences detected in this type of test procedure. It is360 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
very easy to take the conservative stance and to rule out a product if it loses in a blindproduct test. Yet, I often wonder how many excellent products never got to themarketplace because of an inconsequential loss in a blind product test.The overall data of a blind product test are usually more consistent and moresensitive than the majority of the individual panelists (see Table 6.14). This tablesummarizes data from a blind test in which a baby shampoo was compared with ahigh-foaming TEALS based shampoo containing the fragrance and color of thebaby shampoo. This test was actually two tests run back to back, comparing thesetwo products for four 2-week intervals. Among the 73 panelists, for all attributesother than lather and fragrance, fewer than 14 panelists were consistent in theirratings. The consistency obtained in overall preference and in all hair effectattributes was not beyond that expected by random chance. These results show
that differences do exist between these two shampoos, but only about one-third ofthis panel could repeat their lather and fragrance choices between these twoproducts. Less than 15% of this panel could distinguish between any hair effectdifferences between these two products, that is could duplicate their choice for anyhair effect.There is a signiﬁcant lather preference but not a signiﬁcant fragrance preference.Only a small percentage of the panelists were capable of duplicating their choice forhair effects; e.g., for ﬂyaway and luster 9 and 8 panelists were able to duplicate theirchoice. However, the overall test results suggest a difference for ﬂyaway and luster(p¼0.02 and 0.04 respectively).Only a small percentage of these panelists appear to be capable of discerninghair effect differences between these two products. Nevertheless, the statistics forthe overall test results suggest a difference for example in ﬂyaway and luster

(overall p ¼0.02 and 0.04 respectively), but only 9 and 8 of these panelists wereable to duplicate their choices. These results lead one to question whether large ormeaningful differences exist between hair effects of this baby shampoo and adultshampoo. In light of the consistency ratings, one questions how discerningconsumers (panelists) as individuals really are to shampoo performance attributes.Blind tests with larger groups have been run comparing a related TEALSshampoo formulation versus this same baby shampoo, where the sebum-removingcapabilities of these two products in laboratory tests were equivalent. Once again,an attempt was made to match the color and fragrance of these two products. TheTEALS product was clearly superior in various laboratory foam tests and in foamproperty evaluations in half-head testing. The panelists as a group signiﬁcantlypreferred the TEALS product for cleaning efﬁciency, foaming properties, and for
overall performance as well as for several hair effect attributes. Apparently, thesuperior foaming character of the TEALS system provided a “halo” effect thatsubconsciously reﬂected in the cleaning efﬁciency evaluation and in several of thehair effect attribute evaluations.6.4.3.4 Identiﬁed Product TestsDiscernibility is very difﬁcult to interpret from Identiﬁed Product Tests, becauseperceptions from label copy, fragrance, lather, and other stimuli often inﬂuence or
even overwhelm true performance differences. Several years ago, we tested aprotein-containing shampoo, both blind and identiﬁed, 3 months after its nationalintroduction. The blind test scores showed that in spite of color, form, and fragrancevariables, panelists could not discern between the hair effects of that proteinshampoo and the hair effects of another leading competitive brand. However,panelists exposed to concepts, label copy, and product names in an identiﬁed testprovided highly signiﬁcant wins for this same protein-containing shampoo in haireffect scores, against their favorite brands. These panelists (N ~ 300) in a project-
able identiﬁed consumer test were so taken in by the concept and label copy of theprotein-containing shampoo that they simply repeated the concept and label copy intheir performance ratings. This suggests that in some instances, in identiﬁedconsumer tests, particularly in the event of a popular concept, the true performanceattributes of shampoo products may be ignored and even overwhelmed by theimpact of the concept.6.4.3.5 Sales TestsPerformance properties in sales tests are even more subject to the inﬂuence ofpsychologically related stimuli than any other type of test. However, since a salestest is long-term, longer-term performance beneﬁts or negatives will have somebearing on the test outcome. Thus, a sales test can provide some index of longer-term performance, particularly if an effort is made to control other variables.362 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
Unfortunately, this is difﬁcult to do, and the cost of a sales test is considerablygreater than for an identiﬁed consumer test.The conclusions from the above descriptions of different tests suggest thatcleaning shampoos are more successful in the marketplace for concept and foradvertising execution than for real differences in hair effect beneﬁts. This samesituation does not exist for 2 in 1 shampoos. This conclusion suggests that the truecleaning differences provided by shampoos that are currently in the market placemay indeed be real. However, they are relatively small and subtle or the sale ofthese products would not be so inﬂuenced by psychologically related stimuli andadvertising. On the other hand, the current differences between conditioningoffered by conditioning shampoos are relatively large. When subtle hair effectdifferences are complemented by quality advertising execution and other psycho-
logical stimuli (sensory effects) an opportunity for a marketplace success exists.Thus, when larger hair effect differences are created an even greater opportunityexists in the marketplace particularly when the hair effect differences arecomplemented by good advertising execution. When larger hair effect differencesare provided, then the need for psychological reinforcement or sensory effects is notas great as in the former situation when only subtle hair effect differences betweencompeting products are provided.6.5 Shampoo Foam or LatherThe foaming potential of shampoos does not directly inﬂuence the physical behav-ior of hair ﬁbers. However, as indicated in the previous section, shampoo foam caninﬂuence the consumer’s perception of hair characteristics including cleaning.Therefore, a brief introduction into this important shampoo property is providedin this section.A useful work leading to the present understanding of shampoo lather has been
described by Neu [ 54] and by Hart and colleagues [ 55,56]. Neu pointed out that thetraditional Ross-Miles [ 57] shampoo lather evaluation using an active concentra-tion of about 0.1–0.2% is unrealistic for simulation of shampoos. He suggestedlather testing at an order of magnitude greater in active surfactant concentration.Neu used a kitchen food mixer to generate shampoo lather in the laboratory. Thehigh shear rates of a food blender produce lather from surfactants that is moresimilar to that obtained on hair under actual shampooing conditions than providedby cylinder shake test methods such as in Ross-Miles.Hart and DeGeorge [ 55] used a Waring blender similar to Neu to generateshampoo lather and measured drainage rates of the lather to provide an index oflather viscosity. Hart and DeGeorge [ 55] distinguished between foam and lather for
shampoo evaluation. These authors pointed out that “foam” is a broad generic termconsisting of “any mass of gas bubbles in a liquid ﬁlm matrix,” whereas lather is aspecial type of foam formed during shampooing and other processes and “consistsof small bubbles that are densely packed,” thus resisting ﬂow. Hart’s drainage test6.5 Shampoo Foam or Lather 363
has been shown by Domingo Campos and Druguet Tantina [ 58] to produce resultsthat relate to actual in-use salon testing.Some useful conclusions from Hart’s work are as follows: A synthetic sebumload generally lowers lather quality. This is consistent with the well-knownobservation that the second shampoo application lathers better than the ﬁrst sham-poo application because less sebaceous soil is encountered in the second applica-tion. Hart also demonstrated that traditionally known “foam booster” additives suchas lauramid DEA or cocamido propyl betaine should more correctly be called lathermodiﬁers (amides do modify lather feel and tend to make a thicker, creamierlather). However, these additives generally do not increase the amount of lather;they tend to suppress shampoo lather.Foams or lathers are formed when air is introduced beneath a liquid surface and
it expands to enclose the air with a ﬁlm of liquid. The ﬁlm must be elastic toproduce a foam or lather and it must retard the loss of air from mechanical shockand from soils. Materials that provide low surface tensions provide greater foamvolumes and higher foam stability. Longer chain length materials also provide morefoam stability. Polymers and other additives improve foam and lather stability byincreasing intermolecular cohesive forces within the ﬁlm. Fatty alkanolamidesand betaines improve foam stabilization by inc reasing the ﬁlm elasticity. Alkanolamidespack between anionic surfactant molecules forming an aggregate ﬁlm and thusreduce the anionic surfactant head group repulsion. This effect allows a largermore cohesive aggregate ﬁlm to form around the air, giving rise to improved latherproperties.Hart and Neu provided a useful beginning to a better understanding of shampoo
lather, of lather testing, and of the effects of additives on shampoo lather. However,Hart’s lather drainage rates are only one of the important components of shampoolather that is relevant to the consumer’s perception. Lather feel and the rate of lathergeneration are two other important components of shampoo lather. As of thiswriting, methods for these important lather components have not been describedin the scientiﬁc literature.6.6 Sorption or Binding of Ionic Ingredients to Hair
The sorption of shampoos and conditioners to hair is essentially a reaction at or nearthe hair ﬁber surface. Therefore, the approach adopted in this section is to presentthe latest information on the nature of the hair ﬁber surface and to provide asummary of the latest hypothesis on the adsorption of ingredients (surfactants andhair conditioners) to hair. Then, a synopsis is provided of the interactions of ionicingredients of shampoos, conditioners, and ionic dyes with hair. Since ionic dyesare sometimes used in sorption studies as model systems for surfactant molecules,some material on the sorption of ionic dyes has been included in this Sect. 6.6.1 .364 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
6.6.1 Binding to the Hair Fiber SurfaceThe virgin hair ﬁber surface is covered with a thin (about 1–3 nm) covalently boundlipid layer of 18-MEA that is attached by thioester linkages to a proteinaceous cellmembrane called epicuticle [ 33]. Jones and Rivett [ 59] described that Sims andXPS “indicate the surface of virgin wool ﬁbers is almost exclusively hydrocarbon”.Swift [ 60] provided evidence that the proteinaceous membrane beneath the18-MEA is about 13 nm thick [ 60] (see Fig. 6.4). In Fig. 6.4, the epicuticle isdescribed as two layers of protein consisting of KAP-5 and KAP-10 proteins [ 61]and it is bonded to the A-layer on its interior and to 18-MEA on its exterior.XPS estimates by Ward et al. [ 62] suggest that 18-MEA is 1.0 /C60.5 nm thickand molecular modeling shows it to be 1.08 nm [ 63]. However Ward’s estimate was
made on hair containing virtually no free lipid in the surface of the ﬁbers and themodeling was with no free lipid in the 18-MEA layer. Evidence from XPS,described in Chap. 2in the section entitled Surface Lipids of Human Hair , suggeststhat free lipids are bound within the 18-MEA layer. But, when free lipids areremoved by shampooing the chains of 18-MEA fold back on themselves assuggested by Zahn et al. [ 64] decreasing the thickness of the surface lipid layer,see Chap. 1in the section entitled , Thickness of the Cuticle Beta Layers for anexplanation of the thickness of the Beta layers which also applies to the surfacelipid layer.As hair is exposed to repeated washing, drying and rubbing actions and tosunlight, changes occur at and in these surface layers removing some free lipidsby shampoos and removing 18-MEA by photochemical attack on thioester.Fig. 6.4 Schematic illustrating the hair ﬁber surface with 18-MEA and free lipid on the external
layer with epicuticle proteins on the second and third layers6.6 Sorption or Binding of Ionic Ingredients to Hair 365
Furthermore, disulﬁde and other bonds are oxidized by sunlight and small fracturesare formed between layers of the surface from bending, stretching and abrasiveactions. These actions remove some 18-MEA and proteins exposing new proteinmaterial which is gradually oxidized forming sulfur acids, such as sulfonate andwith a decrease in the covalently bound and free lipids the virgin hair surface isconverted from a hydrophobic entity with little surface charge to a hydrophilic,polar and negatively charged surface. The more exposure of the hair to chemicaland abrasive actions, e.g., the further from the root ends the more hydrophilic,more polar and more negatively charged the surface becomes. See Chap. 4in theSummary of chemical changes to hair by permanent waving and Chap. 5in theSummary of bleaching hair proteins and the Summary of sunlight oxidation of hairproteins sections.6.6.2 Overview of the Binding of Shampoos and Conditionersto Hair
to HairThe major ingredient in most shampoos is anionic surfactant. Although othersurfactants (amphoteric or nonionic), thickening agents, lather modiﬁers, condi-tioning agents, colors, and fragrance—are also normally present. Most shampoosare formulated near neutrality and are based on the anionic surfactant salts of laurylsulfate or laureth sulfate (most commonly up to 3 moles of ethoxylation), seeSect. 6.2.3.1.Creme rinses, on the other hand, are basically compositions containing cationicsurfactant in combination with long-chain fatty alcohol or other lipid components.For additional details on product compositions, see Sect. 6.2.5.3 and consultreferences [ 65], Flick’s formulations [ 66], product ingredient labels, and thebooks by Hunting [ 4,5].The attachment of ingredients to hair ﬁbers is fundamental to the action of
conditioning agents. The amount of sorption or uptake of an ingredient by hairfrom an aqueous solution is governed by its attraction or binding interactions to thekeratin, versus its hydrophilicity or binding interactions to the aqueous phase, andthe rate of diffusion of the ingredient into the hair.For conditioning ingredients in shampoos and hair conditioners, Robbins et al.[67] suggested that adsorption is more critical than absorption because the condi-tioning ingredients are relatively large species and low temperatures are employedin contrast to wool dyeing where diffusion is critical. Furthermore, they proposed ahypothesis considering adsorption to hair in terms of a continuum between a chargedriven adsorption process and a hydrophobically driven process see Fig. 6.5.A n
example of what is essentially a purely charge driven process is the adsorption of awater-soluble cationic surfactant like dodecyltrimonium chloride from an aqueoussolution onto hair above the isoelectric point of hair. This adsorption process is366 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
driven by the attraction of the positively charged quaternary ammonium ion to thenegatively charged hair ﬁber surface.At the other end of the spectrum, is the adsorption of a water insolubledimethicone onto hair from an anionic shampoo medium. This adsorption is drivenby the fact that wet hair comes into contact with a medium where insoluble siliconeor another hydrophobic species is suspended in the aqueous phase. The additionalwater from the wet hair and from rinsing perturbs the system, and adsorption occursprimarily because of entropy; that is to keep the silicone suspended requiresadditional molecular organization that can only be overcome by putting additional
energy into the system. Thus, the silicone comes out of suspension and some of itattaches to the water insoluble hair. Although the primary driving force for thishydrophobic adsorption process is entropy or the decrease in the organized orienta-tion of molecules in the system, hydrophobic binding to the hair ﬁber surface is alsoinvolved.This mechanism was presented as a continuum rather than as just two extremelydifferent processes. The continuum exists because as we change the structures ofthe adsorbing species, or the hair or the solvent medium, we can see the mechanism
moving toward a more charge driven or a more hydrophobically driven process. Forexample, in current hair conditioners, as we change the quaternary ammoniumspecies from a short chain to a longer chain species, e.g., from cetyl to stearyl or tobihenyl, or as we move from monoalkyl quats to dialkyl quats, these structuralchanges cause the charge driven process to take on more hydrophobic character. Onthe other hand, if we take a water insoluble dimethicone and add polarity by addingamino groups, we decrease the amount of adsorption. However the adsorption thattakes place, takes on some charge driven character if the aminosilicone is in anonionic or a cationic surfactant medium as opposed to an anionic medium whereincomplexes of low solubility are formed.The binding interactions to keratin are inﬂuenced by the charge of the ingredient,
its molecular size, and the isoelectric point of hair determined by its oxidation state(condition) and the amount of free lipid in the surface, the pH of the surroundingmedium, other salts or components in the formulation, and ingredients that areattached to the ﬁber surface. The attraction to the aqueous phase is governedprimarily by the hydrophilic including the charge character or the hydrophobicFig. 6.5 Schematic illustrating the hypothesis [ 67] of a continuum between a charge driven and ahydrophobically driven mechanism for adsorption of conditioning agents to keratin surfaces6.6 Sorption or Binding of Ionic Ingredients to Hair 367
nature of the adsorbing ingredients. This property is determined by the ratio of non-polar to polar substituent groups. If we are considering absorption, then we mustconsider diffusion rates that are governed primarily by molecular size, condition ofthe hair, pH and reaction temperature.Since the isoelectric point of lightly damaged hair (the most common type) is solow, approximately 3.67 [ 68], its surface bears a net negative charge near neutralpH, where most shampoos are formulated. Although anionic surfactants bind to thishair surface (probably by their hydrophobic tails), the number of adsorption sites iscomparatively small, relative to sites for cationic ingredients. Lauryl and laurethsulfate salts and salts of oleﬁn sulfonate are also moderately hydrophilic. Theyappear to rinse well (but not completely) from hair, and therefore serve as goodcleaning agents.More anionic surfactant does bind to hair with decreasing pH, suggesting that
low-pH shampoo formulations (below the isoelectric point) will leave more anionicsurfactant behind after shampooing than neutral pH shampoos.The diffusion of anionic surfactants into hair is also very slow, and it takes daysfor an average-size surfactant to completely penetrate cosmetically unaltered hair.Although some penetration of surfactant can and does occur, the major interactionsof the surfactants of shampoos and creme rinses occur at or near the ﬁber surface;that is near the ﬁrst few microns or more likely the ﬁrst few nanometers of the hairsurface.One objective of high cleaning shampoos is to minimize sorption and/or deposi-tion of its ingredients. On the other hand, the effects caused by conditioningshampoos and creme rinses are primarily due to the adsorption of ingredients ator near the ﬁber surface. Soaps and surfactants, lipids, cationic ingredients, andeven polymers or polymer association complexes (see Chap. 8) have been used as
conditioning ingredients in shampoos and/or conditioning products. Soaps deposittheir hydrophobic salts on the hair or bind by metal bridging. Cationic surfactantsand polymers attach substantively to hair by ionic bonds enhanced by Van derWaals attractive forces. The substantivity of most polymer association complexes isprobably due to their hydrophobic nature, enhanced by Van der Waals forces and byentropy and possibly ionic bonds. Creme rinses are analogous to conditioningshampoos in causing hair effects chieﬂy by the adsorption of ingredients to hair.The primary active ingredient of most cre `me rinses is a cationic surfactant such asstearalkonium chloride or cetrimonium chloride.CH3 CH3Stearyl-N-CH2-C6H5+C l–CH3-N-(CH2)15-CH3+C l–CH3 CH3Cetrimonium chloride Stearalkonium chlorideMore cationic than anionic surfactant binds to the hair surface above its isoelec-
tric point and cationic surfactants are difﬁcult to remove by rinsing. As a result,cationic surfactants are said to be substantive to hair. Similar to anionic surfactants,368 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
diffusion of cationic surfactants into hair is slow. The more important interactionsoccur at or near the ﬁber surface (ﬁrst few microns and more likely the ﬁrst fewnanometers of the ﬁber periphery), thus accounting for the low surface friction andthe ability of creme rinse conditioners to make hair comb easier (see Hair FiberFriction in Chap. 9). Most modern creme rinses contain a high concentration of afatty alcohol such as cetyl-stearyl alcohol or a similar fatty material in addition to acationic surfactant. Dye binding studies show that these alcohols bind to hair alongwith the cationic ingredient (absorption maximum shifts), resulting in easiercombing and more effective conditioning than by the cationic surfactant alone.The hair surface of unaltered or bleached hair is negatively charged at neutralpH. Thus, the positive end of the cationic surfactant has a greater afﬁnity for the hairthan for the hydrophobic alcohol, especially in bleached hair. Therefore, the
cationic surfactant most likely serves as a bridge to bind the hydrophobic alcoholto the charged hair surface. A related bridging can be used to bind other hydropho-bic ingredients such as dimethicones to bleached hair or to undamaged tip ends(more polar hair surfaces). The skillful use of bridging agents and formula stabili-zation are the keys to improved shampoo technology in the future, see the sectionon silicone polymers in Chap. 8.The condition of the hair also affects the uptake and the diffusion of creme rinseand shampoo ingredients. A rule of thumb is that diffusion is faster into altered ordamaged hair than into unaltered hair. Bleaching (oxidation; see Chap. 5) also
lowers both the isoelectric and the isoionic points of hair, thereby attracting morecationic surfactant to the hair. Thus, the use of bridging agents is even moreimportant to the adsorption to bleached hair than to chemically unaltered hair.Although diffusion occurs more readily into cosmetically altered hair, the moreimportant hair effects are produced by conditioner and conditioning shampooingredients that bind at or near the ﬁber surface. Only in the case of severelydamaged tip ends might internal binding be more important, and even here thedistinction may be essentially semantic.6.6.3 Transcellular and Intercellular DiffusionTheoretically two pathways exist for diffusion into human hair [ 69] (see Fig. 6.6):
(1) transcellular diffusion, and (2) intercellular diffusion. The transcellular routeinvolves diffusion across cuticle cells through both high and low cross-linkedproteins. On the other hand, intercellular diffusion involves penetration betweencuticle cells and through the endocuticle and the cell membrane complex proteinstructures that are low in cystine content (low cross-link density regions). Gummer[70] and others separated intercellular diffusion into diffusion involving entrythrough either the cell membrane complex of the cuticle versus entry via theendocuticle and other non-keratinous regions of the ﬁber and then diffusionthroughout the cortex via both the intercellular cement of the individual cortical6.6 Sorption or Binding of Ionic Ingredients to Hair 369
cells. The schematic of Fig. 6.7illustrates the interconnecting pathways for inter-cellular diffusion through the non-keratin regions of hair.More than seven decades ago, transcellular diffusion was the generally acceptedroute because of the much greater amount of surface area available for this type ofpenetration. However today, intercellular diffusion or diffusion through the non-keratin regions of the intercellular cement and the endocuticle, see Fig. 6.7hasbecome widely recognized as a route for entry of molecules (especially large onessuch as surfactants or even species as small as sulﬁte near neutral pH).Hall [ 71] as far back as 1937 ﬁrst proposed intercellular diffusion between thescales of wool. Such diffusion has been demonstrated by Leeder et al. [ 72] for metalcomplex dyes. Leeder demonstrated that a large cationic dye (rhodamine B,479 Da); triphenyl pyrazine, a neutral molecule (311 Da); and the high molecular
weight anionic oligomeric Synthappret BAP ( >3,000 Da) all penetrate hair throughthe intercellular route.Both diffusion routes probably can occur under the right circumstances consid-ering the right sized molecule, the right solvent system and the degree of damage tothe hair. The intercellular route is probably preferred in many instances particularlyFig. 6.6 Schematic illustrating transcellular versus intercellular diffusion. Note: the differenthistological regions are not drawn to scale370 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
for large molecules because the low-sulfur, non-keratin proteins are more easilyswollen than the highly cross-linked regions (see Chap. 1). However this distinctiondoes not exclude some penetration via the transcellular route. For small molecules,transcellular diffusion under certain conditions might be the preferred route, but notthe exclusive route, especially if the highly crosslinked exocuticle is damaged orcross links are broken by reducing or oxidizing treatments. The preferred viewtoday is essentially that hair is viewed as consisting of a number of domains ofdiffering chemistry and accessibility, rather than as uninterrupted pathways fromthe hair surface to the core of the ﬁber.For large metal complex dyes ( >650 Da), Leeder et al. [ 72] demonstrated that
intercellular diffusion of these materials occurs into wool ﬁber. Certain alcoholssuch as butanols, are considered non-swelling solvents and have been shown byJurdana and Leaver [ 73] not to penetrate into the cortex of wool, but to penetratereadily into the cortex of human hair via the intercellular regions.For many dyeing processes and the penetration of large organic molecules intoanimal hairs, initially the surfactant, the dye or organic material penetrates primar-ily but not exclusively into the ﬁbers through the cell membrane complex and theendocuticle and intermacroﬁbrillar regions. Then during the later stages of reaction,more of these molecules migrate into the more highly cross-linked exocuticle andA-layer of the cuticle cells and the matrix of the cortex.Cosmetics companies have promoted the concept of penetration as positive. To
this end, it can be shown that penetration of large molecules into the cortex occurswhen ﬁbers are split or cracked, see Figs. 6.8,6.9and6.10. Figure 6.8depicts a splithair in cross section surrounded by non split hairs. All ﬁbers were treated with acationic conditioner followed by staining with Red 80 dye prior to cross-sectioning.Fig. 6.7 Schematic illustrating the non-keratinous route for diffusion into hair6.6 Sorption or Binding of Ionic Ingredients to Hair 371
Note the large amount of stain at the split. Figure 6.9depicts a split hair ﬁber treatedwith cationic conditioner and not stained. Contrast this to Fig. 6.10 depicting a splithair ﬁber treated with cationic conditioner and stained. Note the staining occurs onall surfaces even the interior surfaces of the split.On the one hand, penetration may be beneﬁcial if the penetrant is an adhesive ora plasticizing material. However, penetration into the intercellular regions of hair,Fig. 6.8 Penetration of acationic surfactant into a splithair.

between the scales, could also degrade the non-keratin components [ 34,35] andeven cause scale lifting, a form of hair damage, see Fig. 6.11. This phenomenon willbe described in more detail later in this chapter.6.7 Sorption Theory6.7.1 Equilibria and Kinetics of Ionic Surfactant and DyeInteractions with Keratin FibersThere are two thermodynamic quantities of pragmatic signiﬁcance that characterizehair-surfactant interactions: the chemical potential ( m), and the heat of reaction (H).Fig. 6.11 Lifted scales frompenetration and depositionunderneath the scales.The treatment was alternatingtreatments of speciﬁcconditioner and shampooingredients6.7 Sorption Theory 373
6.7.2 The Chemical Potential (Afﬁnity)The chemical potential describes the tendency of solute, surfactant, or dye to movefrom solution to the ﬁber. It is analogous to a partition coefﬁcient. Gibbs suggestedthe use of this parameter in place of the free energy for systems where the freeenergy has the disadvantage of depending on the amount of the system [ 74].In actual practice, the change in the standard chemical potential ( Dm/C14)i sevaluated as the measure of the tendency of the solute to move from the solutionto the ﬁber that is the “relative afﬁnity” of the substance for the ﬁber relative to thesolution phase. This parameter is generally called the afﬁnity and is usuallyexpressed as ion afﬁnities instead of as molecular afﬁnities (see Table 6.15). Oneexpression that describes the standard chemical potential, if the ion forms idealsolutions, is:/C0Dm/C14¼RT ln DðÞfDðÞs/C14where R ¼gas constant (1.987 cal/degree mole), T ¼absolute temperature
(O/C14C¼273.16/C14K), (D) f¼concentration of ion in the ﬁber, and (D) s¼concen-tration of ion in solution. This equation s uggests that the afﬁnity of an ingredientfor hair in an aqueous system is governed by the ratio of its binding attractions tothe ﬁber and its hydrophilicity (the bindi ng attractions to the aqueous phase).Perhaps the most commonly used expressi on for determining th is parameter is theone that determines the afﬁnities of free dye acids. When the ﬁber is halfsaturated with acid (about 0.4 mmoles acid per gram for wool or hair), thefollowing expression applies:/C0Dm/C14¼4:6 RT pH midpointTherefore, anion afﬁnities may be calculated from the pH of the midpoint of thetitration curve for keratin ﬁbers and acids (see Table 6.15).

comprehensive treatment of this subject, including appropriate expressions fordifferent experimental conditions, see Chap. 4of the book by Vickerstaff [ 74],the paper by Lemin and Vickerstaff [ 77], and the paper by Han et al. [ 78].The data of Table 6.15 show that anion afﬁnities increase with increasingmolecular weight or molecular dimensions. The same has been shown for cations.Ion afﬁnities are generally independent of pH, and largely consist of the sum of thebond strength of the ionic attachment and Van der Waals attractive forces, whichcan be very powerful in large molecules (see Chap. 8). Furthermore, as Van derWaals attractions increase, the hydrophobicity of the surfactant increases, furtherincreasing the afﬁnity of the molecule for keratin in an aqueous system.6.7.3 Heat of Reaction
6.7.3 Heat of ReactionThe heat of reaction of a surfactant or dye with a ﬁber is the other thermodynamicproperty that has practical signiﬁcance. It describes the effect of temperature onequilibrium that is whether more or less of an ingredient combines with the ﬁbers atequilibrium as the temperature changes. For cosmetics, the heat of reaction is notnearly as important as the chemical potential, since the change in the standard heatof reaction ( DH/C14) with temperature over the narrow range of temperatures used inpersonal care products is comparatively small. The simplest procedure to determineDH/C14involves adsorbing a quantity of surfactant onto hair and then determiningthe amount of surfactant that is removed at different temperatures. A plot of thelogarithm of the concentration of desorbed surfactant (in solution) at equilibriumversus 1/temperature provides a straight line with slope of DH/C14[79]. Other
/C14[79]. Othermethods for determining this parameter have been described by Vickerstaff [ 80]and others.6.7.4 Oxidative Theories of DyeingTwo primary models have been presented to account for the uptake of electrolyte bykeratin ﬁbers [ 80–83]. Both models consider hair as an ion exchange resin withpositive and negative groups. The Gilbert-Rideal theory assumes that all ions areadsorbed by attachment to speciﬁc sites in the keratin—namely, the ionized car-boxyl and amino groups. On the other hand, the Donnan membrane theory assumesthe existence of an imaginary membrane between two phases, the solution and theﬁber. The existence of a Donnan potential between the two phases then determinesthe partitioning of the ions between the ﬁber and the surrounding solution.Both models appear to quantitatively explain the phenomenon of dyeing keratin
ﬁbers with ionic dyes, although, there has been considerable controversy betweensupporters of each theory [ 80,84,85]. Oloffson [ 86,87] in a critical analysis ofthese two theories concludes that the Gilbert-Rideal theory provides the better ﬁt toexperimental data.6.7 Sorption Theory 375
The objective here is to acquaint the reader with these two theories, to providereference material if more information is desired [ 80–83] and to point out that mostof the subsequent discussion considers interactions with speciﬁc sites in the ﬁber.6.7.5 Kinetics of Ionic Reactions with Keratin FibersSummary of Reaction Steps:Reactions of hair ﬁbers with solute in solution may be considered as a multi-stepprocess involving:1. Diffusion through solution;2. Adsorption or interaction at the ﬁber surface;3. Diffusion or transport into the ﬁbers; and4. Reaction at internal sites in the ﬁbers.Whenever diffusion through solution is rate determining, reactant concentrationsare generally low (about 0.1% or less), the rate is dependent on agitation, and thereaction is usually characterized by low activation energies (3–5 kcal/degree mole).Adsorption at the “exposed” ﬁber surface is generally rapid for ionic ingredients,
and the surface becomes ﬁlled (with respect to solute) during the ﬁrst few minutesof reaction. Diffusion into the ﬁbers is generally the rate-determining step for mosthair ﬁber reactions and is usually characterized by higher activation energies(10–30 kcal/degree mole).Ionic reactions are generally rapid and therefore not rate-determining. However,reactions that involve breaking and formation of covalent bonds are sometimesslower than diffusion into the ﬁbers and therefore can be rate-determining. Oneexample is the reduction of the disulﬁde bond by mercaptans at acidic pH.The amount of an ingredient that penetrates into the ﬁbers and the extent ofpenetration are governed by the following factors:Reaction temperatureMolecular sizeCross-link density of the ﬁbersFiber swellingReaction timeThe rate of diffusion or penetration generally increases with increasing temper-
ature and ﬁber swelling, whereas it decreases with increasing cross-link density andmolecular size of the penetrating species. Obviously, the extent of penetrationincreases with time.Liquid water at room temperature can penetrate across the entire ﬁber in lessthan 15 min, and in less than 5 min at 92/C14F[88], whereas more than 6 h is requiredfor single ﬁbers to equilibrate in a humid atmosphere, and even longer for a ﬁberassembly. Dyes like methylene blue (molecular weight ~320) and orange II(molecular weight ~350) generally require over an hour to penetrate through all376 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
the cuticle layers to the cortex. Similar penetration times would be expected fortypical anionic and cationic surfactants used in shampoos and hair conditioners.6.7.6 Diffusion Coefﬁcients and Diffusion into Keratin FibersSee Sect. 6.6.3 . Williams and Cady [ 89] suggested that diffusion processes may beconsidered as three types: free or molecular diffusion; forced diffusion; andobstructed diffusion. Free or molecular diffusion applies to the transport of matterby random thermal motion. Forced diffusion involves transport by forces other thanrandom molecular motion, for example, pressure gradients within a ﬂuid or electri-cal or magnetic ﬁelds.Diffusion coefﬁcients involving only free diffusion are called true or intrinsic
diffusion coefﬁcients; processes involving both free and forced diffusion are calledmutual diffusion processes. Experimentally, one cannot usually evaluate free dif-fusion in kinetic studies on keratin ﬁbers. Therefore, the usual practice is to applyequations derived from Fick’s laws for free diffusion to data involving mutualdiffusion. This practice provides apparent or approximate diffusion coefﬁcients,instead of intrinsic diffusion coefﬁcients, and compromises the fundamental signif-icance or interpretations of these processes involving molecular motion such as theactivation energies or entropies of activation.In the remaining part of this book, no attempt is made to distinguish between freeand mutual diffusion: the term “diffusion” is used loosely. For more comprehensivetreatment of intrinsic and mutual diffusion, see the books by Crank [ 90] andAlexander et al. [ 91] and the review by Williams and Cody [ 89].6.7.6.1 Fick’s Laws of Diffusion
6.7.6.1 Fick’s Laws of DiffusionFick’s ﬁrst law for unidirectional diffusion states that J, the ﬂux (ﬂow), is propor-tional to the gradient of concentration (dc/dx) [ 92].J¼/C0Dd cd x=ðÞThis equation states that the ﬂow of a substance through a surface perpendicularto its direction of movement is directly proportional to the rate that its concentrationchanges with distance, (dc/dx), the concentration gradient. The proportionalityconstant D is the diffusion coefﬁcient and has the dimensions of area per unittime usually expressed as cm2/s.Fick’s second law for unidirectional diffusion may be derived from his ﬁrst law[93], and it provides the fundamental differential equation for diffusion of anisotropic medium (similar properties in all directions):6.7 Sorption Theory 377
dCdt¼Dd2CdX2Most kinetic studies of diffusion into keratin ﬁbers employ equations derivedfrom this form of Fick’s law and provide approximate diffusion coefﬁcients,assumed to be constant throughout the diffusion reaction. However, Crank [ 94]has provided equations for evaluating diffusion data under a wide variety ofcircumstances, including a variable diffusion coefﬁcient described later in thischapter.6.7.6.2 Experimental Approaches for Diffusion StudyThe simplest experimental approach for ﬁber diffusion study involves periodicanalysis of the decreasing concentration of solute in solution surrounding the ﬁbers(a limited volume of solution). A second approach provides a constant concentra-tion of solute, “inﬁnite bath,” and requires direct analysis of solute in the ﬁbers.Crank and Hill and others have developed diffusion equations for both experimen-tal situations and some of these are described below.6.7.6.3 Diffusion into a Cylinder from a Solution of Limited Volume
Crank [ 95] described several equations for diffusion into a cylinder with changingsolute concentration and a constant diffusion coefﬁcient (D). One of these equationsdescribes diffusion from a stirred solution of limited volume into a cylinder ofinﬁnite length (see below). where Qt¼amount of solute sorbed in time (t), Q 1¼maximum sorption capacity of solute by hair, and r ¼ﬁber radius.QtQ1¼22ﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃppDtr2/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C1212:::::If a plot of Q t/Q1versus the square root of time is linear, then the latter terms ofthis equation (not depicted) may be neglected, and the expression above applies.The approximate diffusion coefﬁcient may then be calculated from the slope ofthe plot with knowledge of the ﬁber radius. Weigmann [ 96] determinedthat this equation describes the reaction of dithiothreitol with wool ﬁber. A similarexpression has been derived by Hill for diffusion into a semi-inﬁnite solid, as shownbelow [ 97].Q
below [ 97].QtQ1=¼2ApDtP=Hill deﬁned a semi-inﬁnite solid as a tissue of irregular shape where no exactmathematical treatment is possible. Alexander and Hudson demonstrated that thisexpression applies to the diffusion of orange II dye into wool fabric [ 98]. A plot of378 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
Qt/Q1versus the square root of time should be linear with a slope of 2A √D/∏.The A term represents the total surface area of the ﬁbers used in the experiment.The variation of ﬁber surface area with diameter is described in Chap. 9.6.7.6.4 Diffusion into a Cylinder from an “Inﬁnite Bath”Vickerstaff [ 80] noted that equations describing diffusion into an inﬁnite cylinder(e.g., hair) or into a plane slab (e.g., skin) from a constant solute concentration(inﬁnite bath), assuming a constant diffusion coefﬁcient, are of the followinggeneral form:QtQ1¼1/C0Ae/C0BK/C0Ce/C0FK/C0Ge/C0HK::::A, B, C, F, G and H are known constants; K ¼Dt/r2for the case of the inﬁnitecylinder; and r equals the ﬁber radius [ 99]. In this instance, to determine thediffusion coefﬁcient, simply carry out a sorption experiment to a ﬁxed time (t) ata given temperature and agitation rate, and determine the amount of surfactant ordye sorbed by the ﬁbers (Qt). The value of Q t/Q1is calculated, and from the
appropriate graph (Fig. 6.12) the corresponding value of K ¼Dt/r2is determined.Since t, r, and K are all known, D may be calculated from D ¼Kr2/t. Obviously,Fig. 6.12 Diffusion into a cylinder from an inﬁnite bath. A plot from data by Vickerstaff. Forlower proportions of penetration (See the data and plots by Vickerstaff [ 99])6.7 Sorption Theory 379
replication of the experiment and determination of an average value for D providesa more reliable estimate. Davis and Taylor [ 100] used this procedure for thedetermination of diffusion coefﬁcients for orange II dye into nylon ﬁber, andHolmes [ 101] used a modiﬁcation of this procedure for evaluating diffusioncoefﬁcients for diffusion of dyes into human hair.6.7.6.5 The Case of a Variable Diffusion CoefﬁcientThe diffusion equations described in the previous section have been derived fromFick’s second law for unidirectional diffusion with the assumption that the diffusioncoefﬁcient is constant throughout the reaction. Crank [ 94] also derived equationsfor evaluating diffusion data for systems with a variable diffusion coefﬁcient thatcan be used to test one’s data.King [ 102,103] found that the transport of either water or alcohol throughkeratin ﬁbers is examples of reactions with a variable diffusion coefﬁcient. Forthe wool-water vapor system [ 102]a t2 5
/C14C, the diffusion coefﬁcient is approxi-mately 10/C09cm2/s as the ﬁber approaches dryness. However, at high regains, it is ofthe order of 10/C07cm2/s. Theoretically, the diffusion coefﬁcient for this systemcould approach the limiting value of 2.27 /C210/C05cm2/s, the diffusion coefﬁcientfor water in water [ 104]. The variable diffusion coefﬁcient in this case is caused bychanges in internal ﬁber structure, during the reaction that involves increasing waterbinding with increasing regain and portions of the ﬁbers becoming more “waterlike” with increasing regains.In general, the penetration of solvents (that promote swelling) into polymersmay be described as processes with a variable diffusion coefﬁcient. For morecomprehensive treatment of this subject, see the books by Alexander et al. [ 105]and Crank [ 93–95].6.7.6.6 The Inﬂuence of Temperature on the Diffusion intoKeratin FibersThe activation energy (EACT) describes the effects of temperature on reaction rates.
For example, the rate of a reaction with a higher E ACTwill respond more readily totemperature changes than one with a lower E ACT. The activation energy can alsohelp to distinguish between diffusion through solution and diffusion through theﬁbers, for example, an EACTof 3–5 kcal/degree mole generally indicates thatdiffusion through solution is rate-limiting, whereas an E ACT of 10–30 kcal/degree mole generally indicates that diffusion through the ﬁbers is rate-limiting.The E ACTis an important parameter in the collision theory of reaction rates.It approximates the energy of activation in the transition state theory of reactionrates [ 106]. As indicated, diffusion reactions for keratin ﬁbers generally involvemutual diffusion coefﬁcients, because they involve transport components other thantemperature. The theoretical interpretations in terms of molecular motions that380 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
follow assume no complications from electrical gradients and other factors offorced and obstructed diffusion that may be involved in these interactions andtherefore the following discussion should be interpreted with caution.According to the collision theory of reaction rates, the effect of temperature onthe rate of a chemical reaction is deﬁned by the Arrhenius equation:K¼Ae/C0EACT RT=where K ¼the speciﬁc reaction rate, A ¼the pre-exponential function (entropyrelated term), R ¼the gas constant (1.987 cal/degree mole), and T ¼the absolutetemperature (0/C14C¼273.16/C14K).The following two equations have been derived from the Arrhenius equation andare convenient for determining the E ACTexperimentally.log K ¼/C0EACT2:303 RTþlog AEACT¼RT2T1T2/C0T12:303 logK2K1The ﬁrst equation shows that the E ACTmay be determined by plotting thelogarithm of reaction rates against 1/T and multiplying the slope by /C02.303 R.
The second equation shows that the E ACTmay be evaluated by determining therates of reaction at two different temperatures and calculating this parameter fromthe corresponding expression above.The EACTfor diffusion of water into wool ﬁber decreases with increasing watercontent, from 7.5 Kcal/degree mole at lower regains to about 4.8 kcal/degree moleat 16% water content [ 102]. The E ACTat higher regains is essentially the same as forthe diffusion of simple solute molecules (sulfonate dyes) in water [ 107]. Thissuggests a two-phase system at higher regains, with water molecules diffusingthrough the aqueous phase within the ﬁbers [ 102].Activation energies for diffusion of the simple dye orange II into both humanhair and wool ﬁber have been reported. Gilbert [ 108] has shown that the rate ofdiffusion of orange II into keratin ﬁbers obeys the Arrhenius equation between0 and 80/C14C. He also reported activation energies of 28 and 23 kcal/degree mole for
diffusion of orange II into human hair and wool ﬁber, respectively. Robbinsdetermined similar activation energies (at low pH) for the diffusion of this samedyestuff into human hair and merino wool (29 and 24 kcal/degree mole, respec-tively). The higher activation energy for diffusion into human hair is probablyrelated to its higher cross-link density.In addition, Robbins and Scott [ 109] found that the EACTfor diffusion of orangeII into merino wool is pH dependent, decreasing from 24 to 11 kcal/degree molewith increasing pH from 1 to 7. Robbins and Fernee [ 110], while studying theswelling of stratum corneum by anionic surfactant as a function of pH, suggestedthat ionic bonding dominates the reaction between hair and anionic surfactant at pH 1,6.7 Sorption Theory 381
whereas hydrophobic bonding between surfactant and hair is more important nearneutral pH. Therefore, if this reaction between ionic surfactants or dyes, and hair ispredominately ionic in character at acidic pH, then the reaction near neutral pHinvolves a greater amount of hydrophobic character and the activation energyshould show a corresponding change, as found.The temperature-independent term of the Arrhenius equation (A, or the pre-exponential function) is generally considered to be analogous to the entropy ofactivation of transition state theory [ 92]. Robbins found that this parameter variesfrom 104to 10/C01cm2/s for the diffusion of orange II into merino wool at pH 1 andpH 6.7 respectively. Hudson [ 111] reported a value of 10/C02for this parameter atunspeciﬁed pH. Assuming the analogy of the pre-exponential function and theentropy of activation hold for this mutual diffusion process; then the diffusion of
anionic dye or surfactant into keratin ﬁbers requires entropy of activation thatincreases with decreasing pH. This effect suggests that there is less precise orienta-tion in the activated state at low pH than at neutral pH for the diffusion of anionicdye or surfactant into keratins. Thus, the reaction of anionic surfactant with keratinthat is dominated by hydrophobic bonding (near neutral pH) requires a higherdegree of molecular orientation than the ionic reaction at acidic pH. This assump-tion is entirely reasonable for a hydrophobically driven process compared with acharge driven process.6.7.6.7 Molecular Size and the Concept of Pore SizeSpeakman [ 112,113] theorized that keratin ﬁbers consist of a solid containing holesor pores. Although the cell membrane complex is not actually holes, with someimagination, one can visualize this region of entry into the ﬁbers as not too far
removed from Speakman’s proposal. This concept suggests that the rate of diffu-sion into a ﬁber containing holes depends on the effective molecular radius of thediffusing species and on the size and frequency of holes in the solid. Apparently thesize of the holes will depend on the swelling medium and reaction conditionsemployed.Assuming this theory to be valid, Holmes [ 101] investigated the size of theseholes in human hair via a dye diffusion study in 0.1 N hydrochloric acid, andsuggested the holes are approximately 15 A ˚in diameter. Wilmsmann [ 114], on theother hand, attempted to determine the relationship between molecular size ofcationic dyes and their penetration into human hair by microscopic observation ofﬁber cross-sections that were previously dyed. Although his reaction conditionswere limited (30 min at 36/C14C in strong alkali), Wilmsmann observed that none of
the larger species of triphenyl methane dyes penetrated into the cortex, whereas thesmaller aromatic diamines did. He concluded that there is a hindrance to thepenetration of larger molecules. The largest diamine that Wilmsmann examined,4-amino diphenylamine has a corresponding molecular diameter of 6–8 A ˚which heconcluded is near the critical molecular diameter for penetration.382 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
The apparent discrepancy between the conclusions of Holmes and Wilmsmannprobably stems from Wilmsmann’s use of a qualitative analysis for short reactiontimes and Holmes use of a quantitative analysis for longer reaction times. Also,different hair and different experimental conditions were involved. However,Wilmsmann’s results do provide a feel for the reaction times and size requirementsfor the penetration of cationic ingredients through the cuticle. In addition, Holmesdata suggests that any ingredient that is approximately spherical or larger in alldimensions than 15 A ˚may experience a slow rate of penetration into hair at low pH.6.7.6.8 Cross-Link Density and Diffusion RateTable 6.16 describes the inﬂuence of cross-link density in different keratin ﬁbers on
diffusion rate. These data show that the rate of diffusion into keratin ﬁbersdecreases with increasing cystine content and therefore with increasing cross-linkdensity. One may conclude that reactions that decrease the cross-link density of hair(e.g., bleaching) will lead to hair that is more rapidly penetrated, and its penetrabil-ity will increase with increased bleaching. Decreasing cross-link density obviouslyincreases the rate of transcellular diffusion.6.8 The Binding of Ionic Groups to HairThe interactions of ionic ingredients such as acids, alkalis, and neutral salts withkeratin ﬁbers are of major importance to shampoos, creme rinses, ionicconditioners, and the group of hair dyes referred to as rinses. In this section, theseinteractions are described as:Hydrogen ion interactions;Hydroxide ion interactions; andInteractions of salts near neutrality with keratin ﬁbers.This section considers the hypothesis that ionic interactions with hair may be
partly represented (at low or high pH) as hydrogen ion or hydroxide ion interactionsTable 6.16 Cross-link density and diffusion ratesType of keratin ﬁber % Cystine calculatedfrom % sulfurRelative diffusion [ 115] coefﬁcientat 60/C14C using orange II dyeHuman hair 14.0 1.080’s merino wool 11.3 1.96’s mohair 9.2 3.456’s down wool 8.8 5.0aCalculated from % sulfur, assuming all sulfur exists as cystinyl residues, and a residue weight of178 Da6.8 The Binding of Ionic Groups to Hair 383
with hair, even though most of us are concerned with the combination of surfactantsor dyes with hair. This approach becomes more palatable when one considers thatfor every hydrogen ion or hydroxide ion that interacts with hair, an accompanyinganion or cation must also interact to maintain electrical neutrality. The counterionthat combines with the ﬁbers is determined by its afﬁnity for the hair and itsconcentration relative to competing counterions. Hydrogen ion interactions aremost important when only simple inorganic cations (e.g., sodium or potassium)are present. These ions have a low afﬁnity for hair relative to hydrogen ion andtherefore compete most effectively for sites on hair at higher pH values which is atlow hydrogen ion concentrations.The acid or hydrogen ion combinations are described in this manner: Thecombination of simple acids (hydrochloric and ethyl sulfuric) with hair; the inﬂu-
ence of anions on the combination of hydrogen ions with hair; and the combinationof low molecular weight organic acids with hair. Hydroxide ion interactions areessentially a mirror image of the hydrogen ion interactions and are described inthree analogous sections. However, interactions of salts near neutrality aregoverned by mechanisms of interaction near pH 7 that are somewhat differentfrom those of low and high pH.6.8.1 Hydrogen Ion Interactions with Keratin Fibers6.8.1.1 The Maximum Acid-Combining CapacityThe maximum acid-combining capacity of keratin ﬁbers, from reaction withsimple acids such as hydrochloric, phosphoric, or ethyl sulfuric acids, is approxi-mately 0.75 mmole/g for unaltered human hair and about 0.82 mmole/g for woolﬁber [ 116–120]. This value approximates the number of dibasic amino acidresidues in the ﬁbers [ 117] that is the combined amounts of arginine, lysine, andhistidine (see Table 6.17). The primary sites for interaction with acid (protons) are
probably the carboxylate groups of aspartic and glutamic acids (ionized byTable 6.17 Data on the acid combining capacity of unaltered hair and woolaFrom 0.1 N HCl Orange II combinedfrom formic acidOrange II combinedfrom 0.1 N HClArginine þlysine þhistidineHuman hair 0.77 0.67–0.77 [ 119]b0.81 [ 118]0.82 [ 113]0.87–0.91 [ 121]Wool ﬁber 0.8–0.9 [ 122,123] 0.81 [ 119] 0.82–0.85 [ 124] 0.88 [ 118]0.83 [ 117] 0.96aData expressed as mmole/g dry hairbBecause of competing hydrolysis, etc., reliable values for equilibrium could not be obtained384 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
interaction with the dibasic amino acid residues) and the dibasic amino acid groupsthemselves.This acid–base reaction involves protonation of a basic site on/in the ﬁberforming a positive charge on the ﬁber that attracts a negative ion to it. Steinhardtet al. [ 116] determined that the uptake of chloride ion by wool corresponds to theuptake of hydrogen ions during reaction with hydrochloric acid. Robbins has shownthe same effect to be true for human hair.Maclaren [ 117] took advantage of this counterion effect and developed a test for theacid-combining capacity of keratin ﬁbers by measuring the uptake of the anion oforange II dye (p-hydroxy-1-naphthyl azobenzenesulfonic acid) from formic acidsolution. Robbins et al. [ 119] used this test to study the variation in the acid-combiningcapacity of hair among individuals. In that study different persons who had treated
their hair with different cosmetic treatments and have exposed their hair to differentenvironmental conditions were examined.6.8.1.2 Variation in the Acid-Combining Capacity of Unaltered HairHair samples were collected from 20 female Caucasians ages 10–30 who had neverbleached, dyed, or permanent-waved their hair. These hair samples were analyzedby Maclaren’s method for the acid combining capacity. The average uptake was0.70 mmole/g. Analysis of variance indicated signiﬁcant differences among thesehair samples beyond the alpha ¼0.01 level.6.8.1.3 Variation in the Acid Combining Capacity of Altered HairBleaching decreases the acid-combining capacity of both human hair [ 119,121]and wool ﬁber [ 124]. Analysis of hair samples bleached to different extents showsthat the acid-combining capacity decreases with increased bleaching [ 119](see Table 6.18). Amino acid analysis of these same hair samples shows no change
in the basic amino acid residues. Therefore, the decrease in acid combination mustbe due to the formation of cysteic acid in the ﬁbers. Cysteic acid forms a strongTable 6.18 Acid-combining capacity of bleached hairSample description Acid combining capacityaCysteic acidmmole/g hair mmole/g hairControl (unbleached) 0.67 0.031 bleach 0.60 –2 bleaches 0.52 –3 bleaches 0.48 –4 bleaches 0.43 –Frosted hair 0.30 0.66aDetermined by the method of Maclaren [ 117]6.8 The Binding of Ionic Groups to Hair 385
ionic bond with the basic amino acid residues and in that manner inhibits theirinteraction with weaker acids, such as formic acid, thus decreasing the uptake oforange II dye.Since the exocuticle and its A layer (see Chaps. 1and2) are highly cross-linkedwith cystine [ 125] and are near the ﬁber surface, one would expect a large increasein cysteic acid in the cuticle and, in all probability a decrease in the isoelectric pointof hair. Thus a decrease in acid dye combination and an increase in the combinationof cationic substances at or near the ﬁber surface occurs with increased bleaching oroxidative weathering.Sagal [ 121] suggested that the acid-combining capacity of hair increases withpermanent waving. Robbins [ 119] could not ﬁnd a change in the acid-combiningcapacity of human hair waved under “normal” conditions on live heads. Both of
these studies involved determinations on whole ﬁber. A “surface” analysis methodmight be more sensitive to such a difference, if it actually exists.Modiﬁcation to the number of acidic and basic groups have been made by Ladenand Finkelstein [ 126], who added Bunte acid groups to hair, and by Robbins andAnzuino [ 127], who added polydimethylaminoethyl methacrylate groups to hair byin situ polymerization.Robbins [ 128] demonstrated that the acid-combining capacity of human hairdecreases with weathering, although only to a small extent. This study involved a
comparison of root and tip ends of ﬁve samples of long hair (longer than 18 in.) thatwas visually lighter in the tip ends than the root ends. The acid-combining capacityvaried from approximately 3% to 13% less in the tip ends. The most severelyaffected sample was hydrolyzed and analyzed for amino acids and found to containsigniﬁcantly less lysine and histidine and a larger amount of cysteic acid in thehydrolyzates of the tip ends (see Table 6.19). This result is presumably fromphotochemical degradation.Most of the subject matter in the following section on reaction conditions and thecombination of hydrogen ions with hair has been studied thoroughly for wool ﬁberand conﬁrmed in a few critical experiments with human hair.Table 6.19 Acid combining capacity of root and tip ends of human hairSample description % difference (tip minus root)A /C09.9B /C02.9C /C012.9D /C06.0E /C02.9Average ¼/C07.0%mmole/g hairRoot ends Tip endsTotal basic amino acidsa0.75 0.69

6.8.1.4 Reaction TemperatureSteinhardt et al. [ 122] studied the effect of temperature on the reaction of wool ﬁberwith hydrochloric acid from 0/C14Ct o5 0/C14C and found only small differences in thetitration curve over the pH range where acid combines with wool. Heats ofdissociation, from their titration data, are only 2,500 calories at 0–25/C14C, in goodagreement with those for the back titration of carboxyl groups of simple acids andof soluble proteins.6.8.1.5 pH and the Isoionic and Isoelectric PointsThe pH at which a protein or particle has an equivalent number of total positive andnegative charges as determined by proton exchange is the isoionic point. The pH atwhich a protein or a particle does not migrate in an electric ﬁeld is called theisoelectric point. The isoionic point is a whole ﬁber property of hair and is reﬂectedin the equilibrium acid–base properties of the total ﬁber; the isoelectric point isrelated to the acid–base properties of the ﬁber surface.
The isoionic point of human hair may be evaluated from titration data in thepresence of salt (see Fig. 6.13) or buffers. Allowing thoroughly rinsed hair toequilibrate in deionized water and determining the pH of the resultant solutionmay also approximate the isoionic point. The isoionic point of wool ﬁber wasdetermined by Steinhardt and Harris to be at pH 6.4 [ 116]. The isoionic point ofFig. 6.13 The inﬂuence of salt on the combination of simple acids and base with keratin ﬁbers(From data by Steinhardt, Fugitt and Harris [ 122])6.8 The Binding of Ionic Groups to Hair 387
human hair is close to that of wool ﬁber (generally near pH 6.0) and it varies amonghair of different individuals. Freytag [ 129] found isoionic points from pH 5.6 to 6.2by following the pH changes of hair in buffer solutions. An isoionic point of pH 5.8plus or minus 1.0 was found for unaltered hair from nine different individuals, in astudy by Robbins.Wilkerson [ 68] found the isoelectric point of a single hair sample to be pH 3.67by measuring the electrophoretic mobility of hair particles in buffer solutions.Parreira [ 130] found the isoelectric point of hair to vary from 2.45 to 3.17, whileHarris and associates found the isoelectric point of wool ﬁber to vary between pH3.4 and 4.5 [ 131,132].Capablanca and Watt [ 37] examined wool ﬁber that had been washed withdetergent and extracted with various solvents using a streaming potential method
to estimate the effect of free lipid on the isoelectric point of wool ﬁber. Thesescientists found an appreciable effect of free lipid on the isoelectric point. Thesurfactant washed wool (containing the most free lipid) provided an isoelectricpoint of 3.3 while the most effective lipid solvent extracted hair provided anisoelectric point of 4.5. These data show that the true isoelectric point of the surfacehair proteins is close to 4.5 and that free lipid which contains fatty acids is animportant and essential component of the surface of animal hairs. So, the more freelipid that is present in these surface layers, the lower the isoelectric point of thekeratin ﬁbers. Therefore, free lipid is important to the isoelectric point of hair and tothe adsorption of surfactants or all ingredients onto human hair and the longerinterval between shampoos the more free lipid in these layers and the lower theisoelectric point.
Similar isoelectric points for hair and wool ﬁber are to be expected, sincechemical compositions of the cuticle (see Chap. 2) are similar and because bothﬁbers show similar dye staining characteristics. Cuticle from both ﬁbers stains morereadily with cationic dyes than with anionic dyes [ 96], whereas the cortex stainsreadily to anionic dyes [ 133]. Since bleaching increases the ratio of acidic to basicamino acids [ 134], the isoionic point should decrease with increasing oxidation.One might also anticipate a similar decrease in the isoelectric point of hair withbleaching, since the epicuticle and A layer of the cuticle cells is rich in cystine.For longer-term interactions, if the pH of the surrounding solution is below theisoionic point of hair, the hair will pick up acid, and above its isoionic point, it willattract hydroxide ions more readily. For short-term and surface interactions, theisoelectric point is more important than the isoionic point. The isoionic point
becomes more important to whole-ﬁber treatments such as perms and bleachesand to longer time reactions.In the absence of added salt, over the pH region of 4–9, there is negligiblecombination of simple acids or alkalis like hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxidewith wool or hair [ 116]. This phenomenon is not observed with soluble proteins andseems strange, since unbuffered solutions (near neutral pH) in the presence of hairthat is free of acid or alkali drift toward the isoionic point of hair. The explanation isthat in the presence of small solution-to-hair ratios (100 to 1 or less), the consump-tion of relatively small amounts of alkali or acid by the hair will provide a388 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
signiﬁcant pH drift in the solution. In addition, in most cases, salts are present in thesolution leading to greater interaction.6.8.1.6 The Inﬂuence of Anions on the Combination of Hydrogen Ionswith HairTable 6.15 illustrates anion afﬁnities of several acids by Steinhardt et al. [ 75] andshows that simple anions like chloride and ethyl sulfate have low afﬁnities for hair.On the other hand, surfactant anions, such as dodecyl sulfate or dodecyl sulfonate,and dye anions (Orange II) have relatively high afﬁnities. In fact, the anion afﬁnitiesof Table 6.15 show a correlation (r ¼0.94 and r2¼0.90) with molecular weight,
2¼0.90) with molecular weight,suggesting that 90% of the variance can be explained by molecular weight. Sincemost of these anions differ primarily by increasing size of either aliphatic oraromatic substituents, this type of afﬁnity may be associated with Van der Waalsattractive forces and entropy. Therefore, the decreasing hydrophilic nature andincreasing keratinophilic nature of these organic acids with molecular size causethe acid to partition from the aqueous phase to the hair phase.6.8.1.7 Anions of Low AfﬁnityThe effect of increasing chloride ion concentration in hydrochloric acid solution isto produce a greater uptake of acid by the ﬁbers at any given pH below the isoionicpoint. Steinhardt et al. [ 116] demonstrated this effect for wool ﬁber and Robbinsdemonstrated it for human hair (see Table 6.20 and Fig. 6.13).When one considers that essentially equivalent quantities of hydrogen and
chloride ions combine with the ﬁbers, it is apparent that the extent to which eitherone of these ions is taken up by the ﬁbers will inﬂuence the other. The hydrogen ionhas a greater inﬂuence on the combination of chloride ion with the ﬁbers thanchloride has on hydrogen, because hydrogen ion has a greater afﬁnity for hair(see Table 6.20). However, since chloride ion does have some afﬁnity for hair,increasing its concentration in solution does increase the combination of chloride—and ultimately hydrogen ions with hair or wool ﬁber.Table 6.20 Inﬂuence of salt on the combination of acid with keratin ﬁbers [ 116]pH Wool ﬁberaHuman haira25/C14C2 5/C14C2 5/C14C2 5/C14C(No salt) (Ionic strength 0.2) (No salt) (Ionic strength 0.2)1.0 0.78 0.83 – –2.0 0.44 0.73 – –3.0 0.15 0.51 0.29 0.464.0 0.03 0.29 – –aData are expressed in mmole/g dry keratin and are interpolations from graphs from abovereferences.

6.8.1.8 Anions of High AfﬁnityA greater amount of protons or cations combines with hair or wool ﬁber, at acid pH,in the presence of anions of high afﬁnity for hair [ 108,113,135]. In fact, the extentof combination at low pH (pH 2.5 or lower) can be in excess of the maximumcombining capacity. This high afﬁnity suggests that interaction between groupsother than dibasic amino acid groups occurs with anions of high afﬁnity. Interactionof the hydrophobic portions of the ﬁbers with the hydrophobic group of thesurfactant is involved, and protonation of amide groups has been suggested.6.8.1.9 Competition of Cations of Low Afﬁnity with Hydrogen IonsIn neutral dyeing or surfactant-hair interactions, competition of cations with hydro-
gen ions must play a role. When the concentration of hydrogen ions is low andcations of low afﬁnity are present, the adsorption of anion is inﬂuenced bythe concentration and afﬁnity of cations for hair. If the cation afﬁnity is highenough so that it is adsorbed, a counterion must accompany it to maintain electricalneutrality. In the presence of low-afﬁnity cations, for example, sodium or potas-sium—hydrogen ions can be taken up until quite high pH values are reached [ 136].However, competition between hydrogen ions and other cations will occur.6.8.1.10 Competition of Cations of High AfﬁnityLong-chain quaternary ammonium compounds have a high afﬁnity for human hair,and they compete quite effectively with hydrogen ions for sites on hair at acid pH inmany creme rinse formulations. Furthermore, they are difﬁcult to completelyremove from hair with anionic surfactants.6.8.1.11 Low Molecular Weight Organic Acids
6.8.1.11 Low Molecular Weight Organic AcidsThe data of Table 6.21 suggest that the interactions of low-molecular-weightcarboxylic acids with hair involve more than simply the back titration of thecarboxylate groups. Many of these acids are relatively weak such as acetic,propionic, and butyric. Therefore, relatively high concentrations of these acidsare required to achieve hydrogen ion concentrations approaching 0.1 M, theconcentration of hydrochloric acid required for its maximum combining capacity.However, these acids at hydrogen ion concentrations well below 0.1 N produceextensive swelling, suggesting that the undissociated acid itself combines with theﬁbers [ 138].390 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
In the case of pure formic acid, extreme swelling results. However, the attractionfor positive sites on the ﬁbers must be greater for the anion of orange II dye than forformate ion, for Maclaren’s acid combining test [ 117] to be valid. For additionaldiscussion concerning this type of interaction, see Barnett’s thesis [ 137] and articlesby Speakman and Stott [ 123,139].6.8.2 Hydroxide Ion Interactions with Keratin Fibers6.8.2.1 Maximum Alkali-Combining CapacityThe maximum alkali-combining capacity of keratin ﬁbers from reaction withsimple alkalis such as potassium hydroxide has been reported at 0.44 mmole/gfor unaltered human hair [ 121] (no Correction for decomposition) and at0.40 mmole/g for wool ﬁber [ 116]. This reaction involves the back-titration of theconjugate acids of amino and guanidino groups of the ﬁbers, forming negative sitesthat attract cations.6.8.2.2 Variation in the Alkali-Combining Capacity
Hair is more sensitive to alkaline hydrolysis than to acid hydrolysis, making thisdetermination more difﬁcult and complicated. Sagal [ 121] demonstrated a higheruptake of alkali in bleached hair and in permanent-waved hair than in cosmeticallyunaltered hair. This effect could be due to a larger number of acidic sites; however,it is likely also due to an increased susceptibility to hydrolysis for damaged hair.Table 6.21 The interaction of carboxylic acids with human hairaAcid used pH % Concentration % Swelling (24 h)Water 7.0 100.00 32Hydrochloric 1.0 0.36 34Formic 1.1 25.0 47Formic 0.4 50.0 62Formic – 98.0 110Acetic 1.15 50.0 47Propionic 2.6 5.0 33Propionic 1.4 75.0 54Butyric 2.6 5.0 34Butyric 1.65 75.0 46Monochloroacetic 1.1 50.0 47Triﬂuoroacetic 1.9 0.5 34Triﬂuoroacetic – 25.0 50Triﬂuoroacetic – 75.0 110aData from Barnett [ 137]6.8 The Binding of Ionic Groups to Hair 391
6.8.2.3 Inﬂuence of Cations on the Combination of Hydroxide Ionswith Keratin FibersQuantitative cation afﬁnities have not been determined for human hair; however,Steinhardt and Zeiser [ 138] determined these for a series of quaternary ammoniumhalides. Their results were similar to those with anions, demonstrating increasingafﬁnity for wool fober with increasing molecular size.Organic ions of small size (below 150 Da) differ very little in afﬁnity and aresimilar to inorganic alkali metal cations, but above 150 Da, the afﬁnity of organiccations increases rapidly. The high afﬁnity of hexadecyltrimonium (cetrimonium)and larger cations is due to ionic bonding plus Van der Waals attractive forcesthat with increasing size increases the hydrophobic nature of the molecule. Scott,Robbins and Barnhurst [ 140] demonstrated a similar phenomenon for human hairby comparing the sorption behavior of hexadecyl- and dodecyltrimonium bromides.
These scientists found that under similar conditions of adsorption and desorption,greater amounts of the larger hexadecyltrimonium bromide combined with hair,attesting to its greater afﬁnity.Cations of low afﬁnity, at high concentrations, increase the interaction ofhydroxide ion with hair ﬁbers. Steinhardt and Zeiser [ 138] described this phenom-enon as an effect of salt on the base-binding behavior of wool. However, cations ofhigh afﬁnity produce an even greater effect in increasing the interaction of hydrox-ide ion with hairs [ 138].6.8.2.4 Low Molecular Weight Organic BasesSimilar to the interactions of low-molecular-weight carboxylic acids with hair, theinteractions of low-molecular-weight organic bases involve more than simply theback titration of conjugate acids with hair. Barnett [ 137] described the interaction ofmono-, di-, and triethanol amines at 25% concentration and higher with human hair.
The reactions of these species with hair involve extensive swelling and ultimatelylead to decomposition and disintegration of the hair.6.8.2.5 Interactions of Salts near Neutrality with Keratin FibersThe interactions of surfactants and ionic dyes with keratin ﬁbers, near neutralpH (5–8), have not been studied as thoroughly as acid and basic dyeing. However,Vickerstaff [ 141] suggested that the mechanism for neutral dyeing is analogous tothe action of surface-active agents at an air/water interface, where they orient withtheir hydrophobic tail extending into the air and the hydrophilic group in the water.Another analogy is the electrophoresis of proteins in sodium dodecyl sulfate, wherethe hydrophobic portion of the surfactant binds to the protein and the charged groupprojects toward the solvent or gel.392 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
Therefore, a mechanism for neutral interactions of surfactants with keratin ﬁbersdepicts the surfactant attaching to the ﬁber by its hydrophobic tail and the hydro-philic group that is the sulfonate group projecting toward the solution [ 142].Robbins and Fernee [ 110] (see the discussion earlier in this chapter) providedevidence for a change in mechanism for the binding of surfactants to keratin asthe pH of the system changes from acid to neutral.Peters [ 136] proposed a “leading ion mechanism” for interactions near neutral-ity. For this mechanism, the ﬁber surface bears a net negative charge because of itslow isoelectric point (pH 3.7). Positively charged ions are attracted to the nega-tively charged surface, thus helping to overcome the electrical barrier for anions.This view elevates the importance of the counterion (cations in particular) in neutraldyeing or surfactant binding to hair near neutral pH. The effect of salt addition on
dye uptake is consistent with this mechanism, since the addition of electrolyte nearneutral pH increases the amount of dye [ 143] or surfactant [ 144] that combines withhair ﬁbers. Since anion and cation afﬁnities are independent of pH [ 77], surfactantsand dyes with high afﬁnities bind readily to hair ﬁbers even near neutrality.As mentioned before, a convenient rule of thumb is that anion or cation afﬁnitiesincrease with increasing molecular size of the organic moiety.Most surfactant interactions with hair are above the critical micelle concentra-tion (cmc), and aggregation introduces complexities to the above mechanisms.Sorption of sodium lauryl sulfate continues to increase above the cmc [ 145].
Therefore, higher concentrations of aggregate near the ﬁber surface may be capableof providing higher concentrations of monomer for diffusion into the ﬁber, becauseit is most likely monomer rather than aggregate that diffuses into the ﬁber. Interest-ingly, nonionic surfactant has been shown to decrease the sorption of sodium laurylsulfate, probably by decreasing the cmc and thereby the concentration of monomeravailable at the surface. Ethoxylation to sodium lauryl sulfate decreases the sorp-tion too, although it is not clear at this time whether this action is simply an effect ondiffusion rate or on the anion afﬁnity or both of these parameters.6.9 Damage to Hair from Shampoos, Grooming,and Weathering6.9.1 Hair DamageHair damage is the chemical and or physical breakdown or removal of structuralcomponents or parts of hair that either weaken it or make it more vulnerable to
chemical or mechanical breakdown. Such damage occurs in shampooing andeveryday grooming actions. Sunlight, pool water, and cosmetic products such aspermanent waves, bleaches, straighteners, and some hair dyes chemically alter hair.These effects increase hairs propensity to further chemical and mechanical break-down as shown by Swift and Bews [ 146] by an increased sensitivity to cuticle6.9 Damage to Hair from Shampoos, Grooming, and Weathering 393
abrasion/erosion and ﬁber splitting. To simulate or monitor hair damage, I concluderubbing actions and impact loading in hair snags are more relevant to actual in-usedamage and breakage of hairs than tensile testing with its abnormally low extensionrate and because hair ﬁbers will generally pull out under tensile loading rather thanbreak, see Chap. 9for details.Shampoos can damage hair by abrasion/erosion and deformation during theshampoo process itself when hairs are rubbed against each other, or when deformedby bending, torsion and stretching while lathering, or while combing or towel dryingor even when blow drying. Shampoos can also slowly dissolve or remove structurallipids and proteinaceous material from hair. Every time a person shampoos orconditions their hair, they either comb or brush it. Therefore, combing and brushingof hair and the resultant damage from these actions should be considered a part of the
shampoo and hair-conditioning processes. This deﬁnition allows us to consider thefact that some shampoos prevent and reduce damage during these actions.Okumura [ 147] suggested that a large amount of cuticle damage occurs in thelathering step during the actual shampooing of hair when ﬁbers are rubbed againsteach other in the presence of detergents. Kelly and Robinson [ 148] concluded thatshampooing and towel drying of hair also damages hair. However, these scientistssuggested that combing and brushing damages hair more than the lathering step ofshampooing, and further that brushing is more damaging than combing. They havealso shown that cuticle loss is greater from wet combing than from dry combing.But in their analysis they did not consider whether some parts of the ﬁber are morevulnerable than other parts in wet versus dry combing or brushing such as rootsections versus mid-sections versus tips.6.9.2 Damage Involving Cuticle Fragmentationand Scale Lifting
and Scale LiftingShampooing and grooming actions cause the cuticle to be more susceptible tofurther abrasion/erosion, to adhesion failure either in the cell membrane complexor inside cuticle cells and to the lifting of scales and other types of hair damagedescribed in this section. These actions also lead to increased diffusion of chemicalsinto hair and to additional damage by penetrating chemicals or products.Shampooing, combing and brushing and exposure to sunlight over time inducechanges in hair that can be detected at the morphological level. These effects may beviewed as aging of hair (not the person) or of weathering damage. Chemicalweathering effects include damage to hair by environmental factors such as sunlight,air pollutants, wind, sea water, or even chlorine in pool water. Several types of the
following different actions produce rubbing of hairs against hairs or other objectsthat result in hair damage: combing and brushing, shampooing (during both thelathering and drying steps including towel drying or blow drying of hair), rubbinghairs during styling, such as curling, braiding and tying or clamping hairs togetherfrequently in the same spot in a bun or a knot, and rubbing hairs against other hairs394 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
while turning one’s head during sleeping or lying down. All of these rubbing actionsexcept the very last one are a part of the hair grooming process.The process of cuticle chipping that results from rubbing objects such as groomingdevices and especially rubbing hairs against other hair ﬁbers is a major factor in hairdamage (Fig. 6.14); also see the discussion in Chap. 1on the different stages of cuticlewear over time. As indicated earlier, hair damage can be produced by either stretchingor bending, by rubbing hairs, by hairs impacting against other hairs, by chemicalaction or even by penetration between the scales (intercellular route, see Fig. 6.6). Forexample, the lifting of scales can be produced by stretching (Fig. 6.15), by bending(Fig. 9.30) or by penetration of ingredients between the scales (Fig. 6.16).Figures 6.17 and6.18 illustrate that scale lifting occurs from stretching andbending actions during normal combing and brushing of hair. Removal of large
sections or chunks of a single scale results from rubbing actions particularly afterscales have been raised (Figs. 6.19 and6.20). Scale breakage in these latter twoﬁgures was produced by the intra-ﬁber rubbing actions created by tying a hair ﬁberin a knot. This type of action, although not common on straight hair, can actuallyoccur on hair ﬁbers attached to the scalp and is more common with curly hair.Fig. 6.15 Lifted scales fromstretching at low RH (SEMprovided by the courtesy ofSigrid Ruetsch)Fig. 6.14 SEMs illustratingdamage from the chipping ofscale edges.

Shampooing or erosion can also remove lipid and even proteinaceous matterleaving the hair feeling dry and more susceptible to further damaging actions. Largesegments or sections of scales can also be abraded, torn or ripped from the hair bycombing actions, see Figs. 6.17,6.18 and6.21. The more severe abrasive damage ismost likely to occur from back rubbing (teasing hair) or from combing hair whileheat drying.The uneven removal of scale sections also occurs by continuously rubbingagainst the same area on a hair as occurs in a twisted or noncircular ﬁber with a“high spot” (high region). See the section in Chap. 9on ﬁber shapes. This type ofeffect can occur even when the rubbing forces are extremely low. For example bysliding a hair ﬁber under its own weight (only 0.58 mg) continuously (about 25times) over two other parallel hairs wear patterns are actually produced, seeFigs. 6.22 and 6.23. Combing hair can also produce a similar type of wear
(Fig. 6.24). Rubbing actions as in back-combing or teasing hair can even induceFig. 6.18 Chipping, scalelifting and tearing of largesections of cuticle byvigorous combing6.9 Damage to Hair from Shampoos, Grooming, and Weathering 397
cortical lifting and damage to the cortex (Fig. 6.25). The foregoing types of damagecan occur anywhere on the ﬁber, even near the root and mid sections of the hair andespecially near the tips.Garcia et al. [ 149] developed a mathematical model to predict cuticle wear,assuming that wear occurs primarily by cuticle chipping. These scientistsconcluded that cuticle erosion from grooming accelerates as the grooming opera-tion moves closer to the tip end of the hair. This effect partly results from the factthat scale raising and removal of larger chunks of scales and even cortical liftingand other types of damaging action become greater as the grooming action movescloser to the tip ends because the cell membrane complex and other vital structureshave been weakened more by longer exposure to chemical and physical actions nearthe tip ends. But, even more importantly, this type of tip end damage occurs because
of end wrapping during dry combing which is discussed later in this chapter but inmore detail in the section on hair breakage in Chap. 10.Fig. 6.19 Tearing orbreaking off of large sectionsof a single cuticle scale afterscale lifting398 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair

In 1982, Kelly and Robinson [ 148] described the formation of split ends by thegradual erosion of cuticle scales during shampooing, drying, brushing and combingof hair (see Sect. 6.9.3 in this chapter and on hair breakage in Chap. 10). Kambeet al. [ 150] concluded similarly, that the loss of or the gradual fragmentation ofcuticle cell layers results in split ends. Robbins and Sandu [ 151] took the method ofSwift and Bews [ 152] for the physical isolation of hair cuticle and modiﬁed it toproduce a method to quantitatively assess cuticle fragmentation or damage to thecuticle. Cuticle particles can be broken off and isolated from hair by shaking shortsections of ﬁbers (approximately 1 cm long) in water or even by wet combing oftresses (Fig. 6.26). These hair ﬁber fragments collected from wet combing orbrushing of hair ﬁbers have been proven to be fragments of hair by microscopicexamination, by infrared analysis and by amino acid analysis.

recently modiﬁed and improved the colorimetric part of this analytic procedure ofRobbins and Sandhu using the Bradford assay instead of the Lowry method.Factors that accelerate cuticle wear and fragmentation are: hair swelling,increased rubbing, increased frictional resistance and damage to the cell membranecomplex, the endocuticle or to other ﬁber components that make the surface layersmore prone to swelling and the formation of cracks or scale lifting. Takahashi et al.[154] provided evidence that cuticle wear on Asian versus Caucasian hair occurs atdifferent rates because of differences in the elasticity of the different layers insidecuticle scales. These scientists showed that the scales of Asian hair are removedfaster by wet sonication or by bleaching the hair followed by shampooing andcombing the hair over a large number of cycles. In the latter case after 90 times forfour cycles fewer scales were found on the Asian hair relative to the Caucasian hair
3.2 versus 1.3 scales respectively. On further examination of the hair using anAtomic Force Microscopic probe to measure elasticity as a function of depth, thesescientists found a greater difference in elasticity as a function of depth for theCaucasian hair (1.41 vs. 1.26). Takahashi et al. concluded that the scales of theAsian hair are more uniform inside and therefore more resistant to fracturing.Takahashi et al. concluded that for wet cuticle fragmentation, the scales of Asianhair are removed by fracturing in the CMC (most likely in or near the central contactzone which has been shown to be hydrophilic), but Caucasian hair fractures inside thescales in the hydrophilic endocuticle. These mechanisms are consistent with thehypothesis of Robbins et al. [ 155] that wet fractures occur more readily in hydrophilicregions while dry state fractures are more prone to form in hydrophobic regions.A schematic representing a mechanism for wet and dry state cuticle fragmenta-
tion is depicted in Fig. 6.27. For wet fragmentation, the ﬁrst step involves swellingof the cuticle followed by the formation of cracks primarily in the endocuticle [ 155]or even the hydrophilic parts of the cell membrane complex [ 154]. These damagingactions result in enhanced swelling and a greater amount of hair fragmentation. Thismechanism also shows that subsequent treatments can lead to either enhancedfragmentation by either dissolving non-keratin material or through additionalcracking that produces cuticle lifting and distortion or conversely some ingredientscan even strengthen the cuticle and inhibit fragmentation, possibly through adhe-sive bonding. For additional discussion on this latter subject see Chap. 9.The fact that swelling of hair contributes to wet cuticle wear has beendemonstrated in many different ways. For example, shaking of hair ﬁber snippetsin water produces greater fragmentation than compared to shaking hair in chloro-
form or other non-swelling solvents. Similarly, for permanent waved or bleachedhair versus virgin hair, the more damaged the ﬁbers the more swelling and morefragmentation. The effects of increased rubbing have also been demonstrated in anumber of ways. The simplest of these is the fact that more fragmentation occurswith a greater number of comb or brush strokes and for dry combing greaterfragmentation occurs in tip ends versus root sections of hair.The effects of increased frictional resistance also leads to more fragmentation asdemonstrated by comparing shampoos to cream rinses or different conditioningshampoos, that usually (but not always) provides for greater fragmentation and6.9 Damage to Hair from Shampoos, Grooming, and Weathering 403
higher frictional resistance [ 156]. Weakening or cracks in the cuticle also leads tomore fragmentation. To date, at least ﬁve different types of cuticle cracks have beendemonstrated. The ﬁrst four of these are cracks in the cuticle (Fig. 6.28) while theﬁfth is through the cuticle and the cortex.Figure 6.29 illustrates the hair surface of a non-cracked cuticle taken from mid-sections of hair in relatively good condition. The crack that is parallel with the ﬁberaxis and in the plane of the cuticle layers (type 1 in Fig. 6.28) has beendemonstrated by many different groups and consists of two essential types(Figs. 6.30 and6.31). The most common of the Type I crack forms in the drystate and it occurs in the cell membrane complex between the upper Beta layer andFig. 6.28 Different types of cuticle cracks shown to form in human hair ﬁbersFig. 6.27 Schematic diagram illustrating the process of cuticle fragmentation404 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair

the Delta layer and is called Beta-Delta failure, see Fig. 6.31. This type of crack hasbeen described in detail by Feughelman and Willis [ 157].In general, if the hair is in good condition and the ﬁber is extended at a very slowrate in the wet state or at high RH [ 158,159] cracks can form in the endocuticleleaving a relatively rough appearing endocuticle on the bottom surface of the crack(Fig. 6.30). On the other hand, if the ﬁber has been damaged chemically, since oneof the main sites of chemical attack is the cell membrane complex, cracks mayappear in that region leaving a relatively smooth surface at the bottom of the crack(Fig. 6.31). Reutsch et al. [ 158,159] described details of the formation of these twocracks and some attempts to reduce or eliminate their formation. These scientistsalso discuss how the lifting of cuticle scales leads to increased cuticle removal orcuticle fragmentation.Cracks perpendicular to the ﬁber axis (type 2, Fig. 6.28) may also be produced
by stretching hair ﬁbers in water or at high humidities at more common extensionrates (including cyclic extension actions) (see Fig. 6.32). Extension of hair ﬁbers to30% in water does not produce Beta-Delta failure, but it can produce multiplecircumferential fracturing with separation of cuticle sections from the cortex, seeFig.6.32 [160,161]. However, this type of failure can occur at lower extensionsduring cyclic extension. This type of failure originates at the junction of the cuticleand the cortex and is induced from swelling pressure by the cortex at this boundarybecause the cortex swells more than the cuticle in water. This swelling pressure onthe cuticle working in conjunction with extension forces initiates a crack in thecuticle at the cuticle cortex boundary that propagates through several cuticle layers.Long term sunlight exposure can create brittleness in the cuticle which isrevealed by tensile extension after extensive sun exposure (Fig. 6.33). The crack
shown in Fig. 6.32 is from extension cycling. The sunlight exposure for the ﬁbersdepicted in Fig. 6.33 is beyond normal exposures, however, these cracks are of aFig. 6.32 Severe transverse cuticle cracks (Type 2) from extension cycling by Gamez-Garcia[160] (Reprinted with permission of the Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists)406 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
macro scale, that is several microns long. It is likely that under normal exposures,related weaknesses on a micro scale (orders of magnitude lower) are created in theﬁber by sunlight exposure and stretching and these defects ultimately lead toincreased cuticle fragmentation.Another interesting cuticle crack (type 3, Fig. 6.28) was ﬁrst demonstrated byGamez-Garcia [ 161] (Fig. 6.34). This crack occurs parallel with the ﬁber axis(Fig. 6.34, left side), but is perpendicular to the cuticle layers and is generallyassociated with heat drying hair. This type of crack tends to occur only in theuppermost exposed cuticle layer and is associated with the relief of pressure by therapid removal of water from the surface cuticle layer producing these straightsurface cracks. That these cracks result in increased cuticle fragmentation isillustrated by the electron micrograph of Fig. 6.34 (right side) showing exposed
endocuticle remaining after grooming actions have removed cuticle in the vicinityof the cracks. The exposed endocuticle suggests that crack initiation is either in theswollen endocuticle or at the endocuticle-exocuticle boundary.A fourth type of crack has been demonstrated by Gamez-Garcia [ 160] and byothers (Fig. 6.35). This crack appears as irregular ovoidal or bubble type cracks orcraters through several cuticle layers. Gamez-Garcia attributed this effect to ther-mal and extension cycling. We observed a similar but larger crack from combingwet hair while heat-drying (Fig. 6.36) which may be viewed as thermal andFig. 6.33 Transverse cracksin the cuticle (Type 2 crack)from long term uv-exposureat high RH and extension(SEM kindly provided bySigrid Ruetsch of TextileResearch Institute)6.9 Damage to Hair from Shampoos, Grooming, and Weathering 407

extension cycling. This crack is most likely related to a combination of cyclicextension actions that result from heat drying and combing hair and the relief ofpressure from the escape of water from the hair during blow drying. McMillen andJachowicz [ 162] reported signiﬁcant damage to hair from the use of curling irons;however this damage has not been characterized microscopically. The ﬁfth type ofcrack is a deep splinter type crack usually produced by teasing or back combing(Fig. 6.25). This type of crack is very deep and proceeds through all cuticle layersinto the cortex.Thus, weakening of cuticle layers by sunlight and or chemical treatments andcyclic deformations results in increased swelling or even cracks in the cuticle andultimately to increased fragmentation. These effects initially are subtle damagingactions. The cosmetic industry has come to understand these effects better today
than in prior years and we are gaining a better grasp on how to prevent or minimizethese damaging actions. For more details on this subject, see Chaps. 9and10.The mechanism presented for cuticle fragmentation (Fig. 6.27) shows that whenthe cuticle cell membrane complex or the endocuticle have been weakened orcracked the hair is more vulnerable to penetrating chemicals that can either promoteor inhibit fragmentation and to grooming forces that can exacerbate fragmentation.Much of the ensuing discussion illustrates hair fragmentation, while the latter effectis described in more detail in Chap. 9.While studying cuticle fragmentation and the buildup of surfactants on hair, wecame across another interesting phenomenon involving scale lifting. We observedthat scale lifting and scale distortion occurs on some hair ﬁbers treated withalternating treatments of speciﬁc anionic and cationic surfactants. Figure 6.37
illustrates a control hair ﬁber used in these experiments, both in the wet (top) anddry (bottom) state that does not exhibit this effect. Figure 6.38 illustrates this scalelifting phenomenon in the wet state and Fig. 6.16 depicts this effect in the dry state.This scale distortion (Fig. 6.16) was actually produced in a half-head study on a livehead. Figure 6.39produced on a subject in a half head study shows how scale liftingdulls the hair. In this experiment alternating treatments of stearalkonium chlorideand triethanol ammonium lauryl sulfate produced the scale lifting (Fig. 6.16) on themodels right side (Fig. 6.39). While the control side (model’s left) was treated withstearalkonium chloride and sodium deceth-3 sulfate where no scale lifting wasobserved.A wide range of cationic and anionic surfactants were examined in this schemeand different types of hair were used to try to gain some insight into the mechanism
of this phenomenon. For hair types, we observed that permanent waved hairproduced this effect more readily than virgin hair and that permanent waved hairtreated with oxidation dyes was even more susceptible. In addition, hair permed onthe head produced lifting more readily than hair permed in the laboratory. Further,the more stringent the permanent waving conditions, the more readily liftingoccurred. The effect could be observed on bleached hair, but not as readily as onpermed hair. These results led to the conclusion that permanent waving or reductivedamage to the cell membrane complex is important to this scale lifting effect.6.9 Damage to Hair from Shampoos, Grooming, and Weathering 409
For cationic surfactants, we observed that lifting could be produced more readilyby cationic surfactants alone such as stearalkonium chloride or cetrimonium chlo-ride than by formulations containing both cationic and speciﬁc neutral conditioningagents such as cetyl or stearyl alcohol in addition to the cationic. Furthermore, thehigher the ratio of lipid to cationic material in the conditioner formulation, thefewer tendencies for this scale lifting to occur. For anionic surfactants, dodecylalcohol sulfates were very effective for producing lifting. Changes to the alcoholsulfate molecule that increase its water solubility and decrease its penetration ratesuch as ethoxylation tended to reduce scale lifting. But, decreasing the size of thesulfate molecule to eight carbon atoms (with no ethoxylation) increased its abilityto penetrate inside the ﬁber and at the same time increased the tendency for scalelifting (Fig. 6.40). Scale lifting could not be induced by the anionic alone. The
interaction of the anionic with the cationic surfactant by alternating treatments wasnecessary to produce this scale lifting.We concluded that formation of a cationic-anionic complex inside either theendocuticle or the cell membrane complex is necessary to produce this effect. Ifthese parts of the ﬁber are damaged, for example, by permanent waving, thenpenetration is enhanced. Adsorption of the cationic species occurs inside the cellFig. 6.37 Control ﬁbers forpenetration/depositionexperiments.

membrane complex and the endocuticle. On washing with the anionic surfactant,penetration occurs and an insoluble cationic-anionic complex deposits inside thehair. After a sufﬁcient amount of this insoluble complex forms in the cuticle, itcreates a hydrophobic layer and scale lifting can occur. Scale lifting in this case iscaused by differential adsorption and release of water by the differences in themoisture binding levels of the different layers of the cuticle cell. This produces abending or lifting action similar to the effects of a thermostat from its reaction toheat and differences in thermal conductivity of its layers. Scale lifting by thismechanism leads to greater cuticle fragmentation.To study the effects of scale lifting we employed a variety of techniquesincluding light scattering. C. Reich made the observation that hair ﬁbers exhibitingscale lifting or scale distortion will show a decrease in reﬂectance at the specular
angle and an increase in the scattering of light at higher angles (Fig. 6.41).F. Schebece constructed a ﬁber holder for the goniophotometer that permittedtreatment in the holder so that before and after measurements could be made onthe same spot on the ﬁber. These same ﬁbers could then be examined microscopi-cally after light scattering measurements. Using this technique in combination withscanning electron microscopy we were able to detect scale lifting caused by thepenetration-deposition mechanism from a few shampoos and conditioners and otherFig. 6.40 Hair ﬁbers treatedin the laboratory withalternating treatments ofsodium octyl sulfate andstearalkonium chloride.

hair products in the marketplace. Several commercial products were capable ofcausing scale lifting on permed-dyed hair. A leading US hairspray (Fig. 6.42),several alcohol sulfate based shampoos when used with a few conditioners(containing a high ratio of cationic to neutral or lipid conditioning agents), and aleading 2 in 1 shampoo (Fig. 6.43) were all shown to be capable of causing scalelifting when used on hair that had been permanent waved and dyed on the scalp.These experiments demonstrated the effects of the penetrating agent forming adamaging layer most likely inside the cell membrane complex or the endocuticleand causing scale distortion and lifting as described by the mechanism in Fig. 6.27.Fig. 6.41 Schematic of light scattering curves illustrating a normal untreated hair ﬁber ( solid line )and a ﬁber with scales lifted ( dashed line )Fig. 6.42 Light micrograph of hair in water illustrating scale lifting caused by alternating

Another interesting technique for artiﬁcially generating scale lifting and splitshas been described by Kon, Nakamura and Takeuchi [ 163]. This technique involvesextraction of proteins from the ﬁber via enzyme digestion followed by freezedrying. This method has been used to study hair damage prevention by polymers.6.9.3 Fracturing Hair by Tensile ExtensionOne important paper on the fracturing of human hair by tensile extension waspublished by Henderson et al. [ 164] and two by Kamath and Weigmann [ 165,166].These scientiﬁc studies show that breaking or fracturing of hair ﬁbers under tensileextension occurs differently in the cuticle versus the cortex and fracturing of hairﬁbers occurs in different patterns. Furthermore, these fracture patterns depend onthe type of hair, the relative humidity and whether or not the ﬁber is twisted or
contains ﬂaws. The section below and the sections on elastic and tensiledeformations in Chap. 9and on hair breakage in Chap. 10provide additional detailson this subject.When the hair has not been chemically or physically damaged and it is below30% RH or above 90% RH, it tends to fracture most often in the smooth fracturepattern (Figs. 6.44 and6.45). The origin of the fracture (Fig. 6.44) is at the cuticle-cortex junction (lower portion of the photograph). The fracture then propagatesfrom this point across the ﬁber in two stages as shown by the patterns revealed onthe broken ﬁber surface. Another type of crack initiation is illustrated by Fig. 6.45.Here the origin of the fracture is in the cortex closer to the center (see the smallhole) and the fracture propagates in all directions from this point of origin.When the hair is dry and between 30% and 90% RH, and slowly extended tobreak, the step fracture is the primary fracture pattern (Figs. 6.46 and6.47). For the

ﬁber depicted in Fig. 6.46, the axial cleavage extends well beyond the step.However, for the ﬁber illustrated by Fig. 6.47 it stops at the step and movesperpendicular to the ﬁber axis to terminate. Long single step fractures like theseusually originate near the surface. When the fracture reaches a weakness alongthe axis, e.g., the cell membrane complex (weakened by free radical reactions) orthe medulla, it then travels along the axis until it reaches a weakness perpendicularto the axis to break away from the rest of the ﬁber. Many treatments that damagethe cortex cell membrane complex (sunlight, bleaches and certain heat treatments,e.g. free radical reactions) tend to increase the susceptibility of hair to multiple stepfractures rather than a single step fracture.Although ﬁbrillation (Fig. 6.48) and splitting are not the primary fracture patterns,ﬁbrillation and splitting do tend to occur to some degree with more damage or moreFig. 6.47 Step fracture (SEM

twisted or kinky ﬁbers and when the relative humidity is lower, rather than when theﬁber is wet. Thus, although ﬁber breakage by extension does produce different endeffects, with rubbing overtime from grooming actions the different fracture patternscan lead to split ends. For more details on split end formation and types see thesections on hair breakage and split ends in Chap. 10.6.9.4 Damage by Removal of Structural LipidsThe dissolution or the removal of structural lipids or proteinaceous matter fromhair, probably from the cell membrane complex or the endocuticle, by eithershampoo, by surfactant solutions or by other cosmetic treatments, has beendemonstrated by several different scientists. For example, Marshall and Ley [ 167]demonstrated the extraction of proteinaceous components from the cuticle of woolﬁber by surfactant solutions of sodium dodecyl sulfate, cetrimonium bromide and
triton X-100. Scott (private communication) showed that part of the lipidcomponents of the cell membrane complex of hair were removed by bleachingwhile Zahn et al. [ 35,168] showed that part of the lipid components of the cellmembrane complex were removed by permanent waving.Zahn et al. [ 168] determined that intercellular lipids can be extracted from hairduring repeated washing with detergents. Gould and Sneath [ 34] examined root andtip end sections of scalp hair by transmission electron microscopy and observed holesor vacancies in the thin cross-sections. These holes were more frequent and larger in
tip ends than in root ends. Gould and Sneath attributed these holes to damagingeffects by shampooing, or the breakdown and removal of components of the non-keratin portions of the hair (lipids and proteins) by shampoos leaving the intercellularregions more susceptible to rupture, cracking and fragmentation analogous to perma-nent waving and bleaching ( Ruetsch, private communication). Duvel and Wertzet al. [ 169] demonstrated that the concentrations of free polar lipids and covalentlybound fatty acids decrease from the root end to the tip ends of human hair ﬁbers. Inaddition, these scientists found a signiﬁcant reduction in the tensile properties of tipends versus root ends of hair. Duvel and Wertz et al. concluded that the progressiveloss of these structural lipids are likely related to weathering and grooming of hair andthey somehow play a role in the decrease in the tensile properties.To summarize, damage to the non-keratin regions of hair can result from chemical
treatment or stretching (cyclic extension or fatiguing actions) or bending of hair ﬁberscreating weaknesses and fractures between the scales other non-keratin regions. Thistype of damage is more likely to occur in tip sections or in weathered hair than in rootends. Furthermore, research from many different laboratories shows that the action ofdetergents can lead to or exacerbate this type of damage by chemically/physicallybreaking down and partially dissolving non-keratin matter from the hair. This type ofdamage is more likely to occur on hair where the cell membrane complex has beendamaged by oxidative treatments or weathering actions or by reduction, than onundamaged root sections of hair. Furthermore, treatment of hair containing weakened6.9 Damage to Hair from Shampoos, Grooming, and Weathering 417
a weakened cell membrane complex containing penetrated ingredients can eitheraccelerate or retard cuticle fragmentation.Thus, it is becoming increasingly clear that shampooing and rubbing actionssuch as those that occur during grooming over time actually does damage hair byabrasion/erosion/dissolution actions. In addition, stretching or bending of hairswhen a snag is encountered (cyclic extension/bending or fatiguing-like action)also produces weaknesses or cracks in the non-keratin regions of the cuticle.Similarly the rapid loss of heat as in heat drying can also produce cracks in surfacecuticle layers especially when hair is deformed during heating as in blow drying andcombing or with curling irons. These actions lead to scale lifting and produce evenfurther damage by rendering those areas more susceptible to cuticle fragmentationand to the penetration of chemicals into the hair. This latter effect occurs because
the non-keratin regions are areas of entry for penetration into the ﬁber. Furthermore,weakening of the non-keratin or cell membrane complex regions by eitherstretching, bending or by penetrating chemicals or sunlight will ultimately lead tothe degradation of the cortex in addition to the cuticle and to an even faster rate ofpenetration of damaging treatments into the hair.Thus, without question, normal cleaning and grooming practices that involvewashing hair with simple shampoos or even with soap ultimately contributes tocuticle and even to cortical damage by abrasive/erosion and cyclic bending and
extension actions and by the dissolution of components from the non-keratinregions of the ﬁber. These damaging effects are ultimately detected by consumersas dry and dull ends or as brittle hair and split ends and by an increased sensitivity oftheir hair to rubbing actions during grooming and to other damaging cosmetictreatments. In addition, Tolgyesi [ 170] has shown that sunlight and chemicalprocessing treatments such as bleaches, permanent waves, straighteners, andsome hair dyes or even chlorinated water from swimming pools can acceleratethese damaging actions to the hair by making the hair even more susceptible tochemical and physical damage.One fascinating observation is that this type of damage is detected most readily
by microscopic techniques or macro detection techniques. It seems to me that thedevelopment of methods to measure swelling of the upper cuticle layers or othersensitive means to detect cuticle damage may someday reveal this damage in amore sensitive manner than the techniques used today. For a crack to appear in thehair, considerable damage at the molecular level and higher levels must haveoccurred, leaving room for detection to a more sensitive degree than by the methodsbeing used today.The best technique to monitor hair breakage and thus hair strength is to actuallycomb the hair and measure the amount of hair broken off. Other techniques notcommonly used such as extension cycling, and rubbing ﬁbers to break are in thisauthor’s opinion more relevant to hair damage and hair breakage than tensiletesting. This is because extension cycling and rubbing actions more closely simu-late combing and brushing of hair than the very slow strain rates and the high
percentage extensions generally employed in tensile testing. For a more detaileddiscussion of this subject, see Chap. 10.418 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
6.10 Hair Breakage by Grooming ActionsHair breakage during combing and brushing is covered in detail in Chap. 10in thesection entitled, Breakage of Hair during Grooming Actions , see Refs. [ 165–177]and the references in Chap. 10on this subject.6.11 Dandruff, Scalp Flaking and Scalp CareDandruff results from a scalp malfunction and is not directly related to the chemis-try and physics of human scalp hair. However, antidandruff products must becompatible with other hair products, and they have become an increasingly impor-tant hair care category over the past several decades. Therefore, the subject ofdandruff and antidandruff active ingredients merits some mention in a book dedi-cated to the chemistry and physics of human scalp hair. Antidandruff products are
the most prevalent scalp care product, although claims beyond dandruff such asanti-seborrheic, dry scalp care and eczema treatment are made for some of these.This section attempts to provide an entry into the literature relevant to scalp careproducts.The relatively recent review by Pierard-Franchimont, Xhauﬂaire-Uheda andPierard [ 178], with a few other sources has been relied upon for updating thissection on dandruff. Dandruff (seborrhea sicca, pityriasis sicca, or sicca capitis) hasbeen deﬁned by Kligman as “chronic noninﬂammatory scaling of the scalp” [ 179],as observed clinically. This deﬁnition allows clinicians to differentiate betweendandruff and other scaly scalp diseases such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis orseborrheic dermatitis, etc. Others have demonstrated histologically that inﬂamma-tion exists in the upper dermis in dandruff [ 180]. Furthermore, it is clear that
inﬂammation is critical to the development and to the treatment of dandruff.Nevertheless, these facts do not negate or reduce the utility of Kligman’s deﬁnitionof dandruff for clinical evaluation.The stratum corneum in the dandruff scalp is thinner [ 181] than in the normalscalp. In addition, the epidermal turnover rate is increased in dandruff [ 181,182]. Ithas been suggested that this rapid transfer of cells to the scalp surface inhibitscomplete keratinization of the stratum corneum. Therefore, the developing stratumcorneum becomes less coherent, cracks develop, and ﬂakes result. Market researchshows that 80–90% of adults suffer from some form of scalp ﬂaking problem.About 40% of these have dry scalp and 30–35% have dandruff. But, Robert Waltherof New York Presbyterian Hospital estimates that only 4–5% of those with a scalpproblem go to a physician. Thus, most of these consumers either conclude that theyhave dandruff or they deny any scalp malfunction.
have dandruff or they deny any scalp malfunction.Dandruff is age-related [ 183], rarely seen before puberty, but common with theonset of puberty. It peaks in the early twenties and declines in middle and further6.11 Dandruff, Scalp Flaking and Scalp Care 419
advancing age. Dandruff appears to be seasonal, being most severe in the wintermonths (October through December) and milder in the summer [ 183]. Dandruff occursequally among males and females [ 184]. The primary cause of dandruff today isbelieved to be the Malassezia spp. Flora [ 178]. Decades ago lipophilic yeasts of thegenus Malassezia, previously known as Pityrosporum, were believed to be the primarycause of dandruff [ 185,186]. In the 1960s and 1970s this fungal relationship waswidely disputed [ 187]. However, after decades of additional research most today agreethat the primary cause is Malassezia spp. Flora. It is also accepted that some auxiliarynon-microbial causes are also operative such as various types of irritants [ 178].6.11.1 The Cause of DandruffIve [184] suggested that high levels of sweat and sebum production and the use of
alkaline soaps are “predisposing factors” for the disease spectrum of dandruff/seborrheic dermatitis. Years ago, Van Abbe and Dean [ 186] suggested that dandruffis an adaptive response to a threshold irritation. The irritation could result frommetabolic products of Malassezia, from other microﬂora, or other sources. Thisconclusion is consistent with the observation of Heilengotter and Braun-Falco [ 180]that inﬂammation can be detected histologically in dandruff. Some experts [ 184]say that mild seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis have features indistinguishablefrom dandruff. In more severe cases, psoriasis (Fig. 6.49) can be distinguished fromdandruff (Fig. 6.50). In milder cases of seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff,
distinctions made readily by clinicians or dermatologists are not easily made byuntrained consumers who generally do not go to a physician for diagnosis. In factmost consumers who exhibit the combined symptoms of scalp ﬂaking and itching,of almost any origin, call their condition dandruff.Dandruff clinicals today are generally conducted in temperate climates, in the“winter time”, during the “dandruff season”. Yet, scalp ﬂaking and itching doesoccur in tropical and subtropical climates and dandruff does exist for some even inthe summer. Most consumers who exhibit these symptoms in any climate call theircondition dandruff. The data of Table 6.22 show that the Malassezia activity ofFig. 6.49 Photographillustrating the silvery scalycondition of psoriasis420 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
several common antidandruff agents varies by 4 orders of magnitude and that coaltar, although effective against dandruff, has virtually no activity against Malasseziayeasts.Furthermore, selenium sulﬁde exhibits substantially lower activity againstMalassezia than ketoconazole, however, in 4 out of 5 clinical studies, these twoantidandruff agents were found to be equally effective against dandruff. Ketocona-zole was shown to be more effective in only 1 of the 5 studies [ 188]. Ketoconazolehas also been shown by Pierard et al. [ 189] to inhibit Malassezia growth on the scalpand the hair for longer periods of time than zinc pyrithione or selenium sulﬁde. IfMalassezia is the primary cause of dandruff and ketoconazole is orders ofFig. 6.50 The dandruffscalp; note the small dry scalydandruff ﬂakesTable 6.22 Dandruff actives and Malassezia activity (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC])Active ingredient MIC versusMalassezia% Active shown Suggestedmechanism Effective versus

magnitude more effective against this fungus, then other variables must be involvedto help explain the reason why it is not more effective than the other agents inclinical testing. Variables such as the afﬁnity of Malassezia to speciﬁc corneocytes,or the presence of certain irritants or antiirritants in formulations have been cited aspossibilities [ 178].We have been able to generate the symptoms of scalp ﬂaking and itching withmild erythema by daily treatment of panelists with a shampoo in warm weatherclinical conditions. These panelists called their condition “dandruff”. Further, wewere able to demonstrate that this condition could be improved by either the sameshampoo with climbasole (antifungal and anti-inﬂammatory agent) or by treatmentwith a shampoo containing aspirin (anti-inﬂammatory agent) versus a placeboshampoo. Aspirin exhibits virtually no microbiological activity against Malassezia.The results of this study are consistent with Van Abbe’s original hypothesis that
dandruff is an adaptive response to a threshold irritation. Our conclusion is thatdandruff, diagnosed by consumers, is an inﬂammatory disease with multiple causes(irritants). The primary cause for the production or appearance of irritants isMalassezia spp., however, consumers susceptible to harsh detergents or alkalinesoaps or to metabolic irritants produced by Malassezia respond when exposed tothese irritants and produce the symptoms of scalp itching and ﬂaking and call theircondition dandruff. The cures are to either eliminate the primary irritant cause byantifungal agents and/or to combat the symptoms with an anti-inﬂammatory agentsuch as aspirin, steroids or antidandruff agents that contain anti-inﬂammatoryproperties.As is frequently the case, if the irritant is produced by Malassezia then an anti-
fungal agent is effective. However, if the irritant is alkaline soap or a harshshampoo, as in the warm weather clinical above, elimination of the irritant andtreatment with an anti-inﬂammatory is the remedy of choice. Many commonantidandruff agents also exhibit anti-inﬂammatory behavior, for example,climbasole, zinc pyrithione and ketoconazole known as antifungal agents are alsoanti-inﬂammatories and can function to improve the scalp condition to some degreeeven when Malassezia is not the primary causative agent.Another interesting characteristic of antidandruff shampoos is their effect onsebum. For example, selenium disulﬁde in a shampoo increases sebum production[190,191] and it alters the ratio of triglycerides to free fatty acids found in sebum.Presumably, this latter effect involves reducing the microﬂora responsible forproducing lipolytic enzymes on the scalp that hydrolyze triglycerides to free fatty
acids. Zinc pyrithione appears to behave similarly and has been shown to increasehair greasiness [ 19], presumably in an analogous manner. However, ketoconazolebehaves in the opposite manner. Pierard-Franchimont et al. [ 53] conﬁrmed theincrease in sebum excretion rate for selenium sulﬁde and further demonstratedthat ketoconazole decreases sebum excretion. The effects of most antidandruffagents to increase sebum levels in hair are analogous to the effects on sebumproduction during puberty [ 192] and opposite to the effects on sebum productionin post-menopausal women [ 193], see Chap. 1for more details.422 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
6.11.2 Antidandruff Treatments and Hair Shedding (TelogenEfﬂuvium)In some cases, hair shedding and hair thinning have been associated with dandruffand seborrheic dermatitis. Pierard-Franchimont et al. [ 194] conducted a studyamong 150 men selected to have abnormal shedding of hair related to androgeneticalopecia associated with dandruff. This panel was separated into three differentgroups and treated with shampoos containing either 1% ketoconazone, 1%piroctone olamine or 1% zinc pyrithione. Each group was instructed to shampoo2–3 times a week for 6 months. Hair shedding during shampooing, hair density onthe vertex, anagen percentages, hair shaft diameters, itching (pruritus) and dandruff
were evaluated in all three groups. The results showed that hair shedding decreasedfrom all three treatments. The anagen percentage also increased for all threetreatments, but the hair shaft diameter increased only for the ketoconazole andpiroctone olamine treatments. Hair shaft diameter did not increase for the zincpyrithione treatment. A primary conclusion was that telogen efﬂuvium or abnormalshedding of hair associated with dandruff was controlled by all three antidandruffshampoos.6.11.3 Antidandruff Ingredients and the Evaluationof DandruffThe OTC monograph of 1983 recommended three classes of potential antidandruffingredients [ 183]:Category I: Active ingredients considered safe and effective for use for dandruff,seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis.Category II: Ingredients not recognized as safe and effective or misbranded.Category III: More data are required.Actually, at this time only two categories are recognized: Category I, as deﬁned
above, and Category II. All other ingredients are not recognized as safe and/oreffective in this more recent classiﬁcation.Six ingredients are currently recognized as safe and effective for use againstdandruff in the United States, and these are listed in Table 6.23. The OTCrecommends each ingredient at speciﬁc concentrations for speciﬁed purposes(products and applications). Other ingredients either reported or shown to beeffective against dandruff and described either in the OTC monograph, thepublished literature, or the patent literature include alkyl isoquinolinium bromide,allantoin, benzethonium chloride, magnesium omadine, climbazole (1-Imidazopyl-1-(p-chlorophenoxy)-3,3-dimethyl butan-2-one), and octopirox (1-hydroxy-4-methyl-6-(2,4,4 trimethyl pentyl))-2 (1H) pyridine ethanolamine. These latteringredients have not been described in category I by the OTC monograph, however,6.11 Dandruff, Scalp Flaking and Scalp Care 423
they are highly effective against dandruff and climbasole is widely used outside theUnited States.Several methods have been described to evaluate dandruff, such as brushing offthe hair and/or the scalp with various devices and weighing the scruf [ 182,195].However, the most popular approach involves partitioning the scalp into severalareas, rating each area for dandruff severity, and analyzing the combined datastatistically [ 196]. The scalp partitioning method using appropriate statisticalprocedures provides a powerful tool to evaluate dandruff severity and the efﬁcacyof antidandruff products.6.11.4 Effect of Medium (Delivery) on Antidandruff EfﬁcacyA study by Georgalas [ 197] demonstrated that Octopirox at 0.2% in 10.5% sodiumlaureth sulfate plus 3% sodium lauroyl lactylate was more effective than the same
active ingredient at 0.2% in 10.5% sodium laureth sulfate (with no lactylate) andjust as effective as octopirox at 0.5% in 10.5% sodium laureth sulfate (with nolactylate). This effect was explained by an enhanced delivery of the activeantidandruff agent to the hair and the scalp in the mixed surfactant system. Theauthors suggested that acyl lactylates have demonstrated spontaneous formation ofvesicles and solubilization of the active ingredient.6.11.5 Effect of Residence Time on Antidandruff EfﬁcacyPierard-Franchimont et al. [ 198] determined that a 5 min residence time improvesantidandruff efﬁcacy for both 1% ketoconazole and 1% piroctone olaminecontaining shampoos. Both shampoos showed improvements in scaliness andyeast colonization. However the increased treatment time provided more improve-ment to the piroctone oleamine treatment than for the ketoconazole containingshampoo.Table 6.23 Active ingredients for dandruffIngredient Concentration (%) Use

6.12 Toxicity, Regulation, Product Safety and Skin Irritation6.12.1 Regulation and Safety Issues (USA)Several toxicity, irritation and sensitization phenomena will be summarized in thissection with special reference to hair care products that contain surface activeagents. Skin irritation by surfactants will be covered in some depth providing afew fundamental principles and useful relationships of skin irritation to surfactantmolecular structure to provide guidance for formulating milder hair care products.But ﬁrst, a few important regulatory statutes will be summarized and referenced forfurther follow up as needed.The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 provided deﬁnitions for cosmeticsand drugs and prohibited interstate commerce for cosmetics that are adultered ormisbranded. By deﬁnition, adultered means that the product, contains a poisonousor deleterious substance, a non-permitted color additive or ﬁlthy, putrid or
decomposed substance or it was manufactured or held under non-sanitaryconditions. Misbranded means it contains false labeling, does not contain therequired labeling or it is not truthfully packaged.By this act, cosmetics are “those articles (or their ingredients) that are applied tothe human body for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering theappearance without affecting the body’s structure or function.” On the other hand,“those articles promoted as cosmetics, but also intended to treat or prevent diseaseor to affect the structure or functions of the human body are drugs as well ascosmetics and must comply with the requirements for both drugs and cosmetics.”By these deﬁnitions, an antidandruff shampoo is an over the counter (OTC) drugand cosmetic while a cleaning or conditioning shampoo is a cosmetic. Soap bars areexempt, that is, are not restricted by regulations of either cosmetics or drugs.
The Federal Hazardous Substances Acts (FHSA) of 1940 and of 1960 deﬁnesﬁve areas of acute toxicity/irritation that are of primary importance for the devel-opment and sale of consumer products: acute oral toxicity, dermal toxicity, primarydermal irritation, eye irritation, and acute inhalation toxicity. The FHSA actdescribes recommended test conditions in detail for these toxicity/irritation phe-nomena. Some knowledge of the potential for sensitization and phototoxicity arealso relevant. It is also necessary to provide long term safety assurance related topotential carcinogenicity and mutagenicity.Carcinogens react with nuclear material to alter the feedback mechanism thatnormally limits cell replication. Carcinogenicity and long term safety are not theobjective of this section. Other sources should be consulted to properly cover thesesubjects. In the mid-1960s the FDA set up an expert panel to review OTC drug
ingredients. This group initially proposed three categories from the perspective ofsafety and efﬁcacy. The three categories are: Category I (safe and effective),Category II: (not safe or effective) and Category III (more data is necessary for adecision). In the 1980s group III was eliminated. Over the years, OTC panels havemet to classify several types of ingredients in these categories to provide safety and6.12 Toxicity, Regulation, Product Safety and Skin Irritation 425
efﬁcacy guidance for OTC products. In the section on dandruff products, results ofthe OTC panel on antidandruff ingredients are described.The Toxic Substances Control Act of 1977 (TSCA), written October 11, 1976but became effective January 1, 1977 and was enacted to control new ingredients. Itstated that any ingredient sold, manufactured, imported or processed for use in aconsumer product must be on the TSCA inventory. This process required, ﬁling apre manufacturing notiﬁcation (PMN) with the Environmental and ProtectionAgency (EPA). The PMN must contain safety data to demonstrate the ingredientto be safe within reasonable doubt. The EPA must reply within 90 days to list theingredient or recommend additional testing [ 199]. EINICS is the European equiva-lent to TSCA and it controls the registration of new ingredients sold in consumerproducts in Europe. Many other countries have their own equivalent to TSCA toregulate the use of new ingredients sold in consumer products.
One principle that has become increasingly relevant to all of these phenomena isthe existence of a threshold effect. The threshold effect means that below a speciﬁcconcentration, for each ingredient and each phenomenon, there will be no irritation,sensitization or toxicity. This principle is especially important to products whenimpurities, fragrance components and preservatives are being questioned, that is,where exceedingly low levels of ingredients are involved. The reason is that manysensitizers are capable of causing reaction at or below 0.5% concentration (but notat part per million levels) while potential carcinogens can be active at even lowerconcentrations.The existence of a threshold effect in sensitization and long term toxicity was
open to question only a few decades ago. However for sensitization and skinirritation a threshold effect is clearly accepted today. Decades ago, the DelaneyClause in the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 to the Federal Food, Drug andCosmetic Act called for “absolute safety”, that is, the elimination of color additivescontaining a carcinogenic “constituent”. However, in the 1980s the FDA tookaction that allowed for approval of color additives containing a carcinogenic“constituent”, if it could be shown that the additive was safe under conditions ofuse. This FDA action provides indirect recognition of a threshold effect in carcino-genicity and in long term toxicity.6.12.2 Eye IrritationFor testing new ingredients or new products, separate and distinctly different testsare used to assess potential eye and skin irritation. That’s because these twophenomena are different mechanistically. Nevertheless, as a ﬁrst approximation,
most materials that are irritating to skin are also irritating to eyes and vice versa.The Draize rabbit eye irritation test has been used for decades as an animalmodel to predict eye irritation in humans. However, since the rabbit eye does nottear, and of course the human eye does, this model is imperfect for predictingirritation to human eyes. Obviously, the rabbit eye test cannot be used to evaluate426 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
“no more tears” shampoo claims. A large number of laboratory models have beenexamined over the past decade to provide a predictive tool to be used either in placeof or to minimize the use of animals for eye testing. Among these models, the HET-CAM test and the CAM-VA assay by Spielmann et al. [ 200] show promise.As indicated above, those materials that are skin irritants are oftentimes eyeirritants too, although there is not a perfect correlation between the two tests. Thedata of Table 6.24 show that adding up to 12 ethylene oxide units to an alcoholsulfate detergent as sodium laureth-12 sulfate produce virtually no skin irritation.However, adding only 1–3 ethylene oxide units creates sodium laureth-(1–3) sulfatea surfactant that is more irritating to eyes, but further increasing the number ofethoxy groups beyond 3–12 decreases both eye and skin irritation.6.12.3 Skin Irritation
6.12.3 Skin IrritationThe irritation of human skin can be considered as a four step process. The potentialirritant must ﬁrst adsorb to the stratum corneum, the outer protective “non-living”barrier membrane, see the schematic of Fig. 6.51. The next step involves diffusionthrough the non-living stratum corneum. The substance can disrupt the stratumcorneum and/or desorb into the living tissue where it can react to cause thesymptoms of irritation.When an irritating ingredient reacts in the living tissue (the epidermis), hista-mine, a natural vasodilator is released. Histamine increases the blood ﬂow (ﬂuid)into the irritated site. Fibinogen, a clotting protein causes a “walling off” in thetissue to prevent the spread of the toxin or irritant. These defensive reactions help toaccount for the clinical symptoms of redness and swelling that are frequentlyTable 6.24 Effect of ethoxylation on skin and eye irritation by anionic surfactantsSurfactant (no.

associated with irritation. Dryness and scaling or ﬂaking of skin result primarilyfrom reactions in the stratum corneum itself, although reaction in the living layersimmediately beneath the stratum corneum can also lead to ﬂaking of skin byincreasing the turnover time, analogous to ﬂaking of the scalp associated withdandruff.The types of tests used to assess skin irritation potential of ingredients orproducts are many and are varied. Tests on animals of different species are usedto assess safety and are usually blunt tools. Rabbits, guinea pigs and humans arefrequently used species. Human in-vivo tests of products or solutions of ingredientsapplied under patches or in plastic or glass chambers have been used. Arm or handimmersion or repeat applications to sensitive areas, such as the inside of theforearms or the cheeks are also common test sites.Many in-vitro models have also been developed to assess skin irritation. Many of
these involve the swelling of human or animal skin by Robbins and Fernee [ 110],the swelling of a collagen ﬁlm by Blake-Haskins et al. [ 201], water vapor loss byVan der Volk [ 202] and squamometry by Paye and Cartiaux [ 203]. All of thesemethods have shown some degree of correlation to skin irritation on humans andanimals. The results from many of these tests have been considered in the nextsection to provide some “rules of thumb” to describe and compare the relationshipsof skin irritation potential for various surfactants.A mathematical model will also be presented to allow prediction of the relativeirritation potential of mixtures of surfactants, that is, of products such as shampoosand light duty liquid detergents.6.12.4 Principles for the Relative Skin Irritation by SurfactantsThe following ﬁve “rules of thumb” for skin irritation by surfactants are followedwith only a few exceptions. These rules can facilitate in developing surfactantproducts that are mild to skin.

1. For each type of surfactant, there is generally a maximum in skin irritation thatusually occurs at a chain length of 12 carbon atoms on the hydrophobic part ofthe surfactant molecule.2. Adding or increasing the number of ethylene oxide units in a surfactant usuallymakes it milder to skin.3. There is a good correlation between increasing the molecular weight of ananionic surfactant and mildness to skin. This rule probably applies to allsurfactants at the peak irritation structure of 12 carbon atoms, but not below.4. Molecular association between different surfactants makes the ingredients (sys-tem) milder to skin, for example, adding cationic or amphoteric surfactants toanionic surfactants decreases the irritation by the anionic.5. It is possible to describe the relative irritation potential for mixtures ofsurfactants (products) by a mathematical model involving linear combinationsof irritation constants for each surfactant multiplied by its concentration.
The remaining part of this section on skin irritation is concerned with describingthese ﬁve principles of surfactant mildness in more detail.6.12.5 Support for the Principles of Surfactant Skin Irritation6.12.5.1 Anionic SurfactantsFrom a synthesis of the results in the literature describing in-vitro and in-vivo skinirritation, for most anionic surfactants regardless of the hydrophilic group, there isgenerally a maximum in skin irritation at a hydrophobic chain length of 12–14carbon atoms. For example, consider alkyl sulfates. For the swelling of humanepidermal membrane by Robbins and Fernee [ 110] and for irritation of human skinby Kligman [ 204], there is a maximum at 12 carbon atoms, see Fig. 6.52. For alkylbenzene sulfonates and for alpha oleﬁn sulfonates, Imokawa et al. [ 205] haveshown a maximum in the generation of skin roughness at 12 carbon atoms andfor sodium salts of fatty acids, Matthies [ 206] has described a maximum in skinirritation at 12 carbon atoms.
irritation at 12 carbon atoms.Alkyl ether sulfates of dodecyl sulfate show a decrease in skin irritation and skinswelling [ 204] with increasing ethoxy numbers from 1 to between 9 and 12 units ofethylene oxide where the irritation is negligible, see Table 6.24.6.12.5.2 Nonionic SurfactantsAlthough nonionic surfactants are generally less irritating to skin than analogousanionic and cationic surfactants, neat solutions or high concentrations of someethoxylates can produce severe irritation, see the data of Table 6.25. These datashow that the effect of increasing ethylene oxide units produces less irritation,6.12 Toxicity, Regulation, Product Safety and Skin Irritation 429
similar to that of increasing the chain length of anionic surfactants. A maximum inirritation at 12 carbon atoms is not shown by these data, probably because of thelimited chain length variation in the nonionics tested.With nonionics containing only a few ethylene oxide groups, another concern isthat some of these such as laureth-3 can anesthetize eyes. This effect poses aproblem in a shampoo type product formulated with irritating surfactants; however,fortunately these surfactants are not normally used in shampoos.6.12.5.3 Amphoterics and CationicsSolutions or dispersions of amphoteric and cationic type surfactants were tested at
10% concentration on humans along with several other types of surfactants bywashing two times daily on the antecubital spaces of test subjects and then rinsing.Each day the subjects’ skin was scored for irritation and afterwards the surfactantswere separated into four groups based on their relative irritation rankings. The mostirritating group included cocamine oxide and coco-betaine which were in the sameTable 6.25 Skin irritation inrabbits by nonionicsurfactants [ 207]Surfactant Irritation scoreaC9-11-2.5 EO Extreme (7.75)C12-15-7 EO SevereC14-15-7 EO SevereC14-15-11 EO ModerateC14-15-13 EO Moderate (3.59)aTwenty-four hours on rabbits backs occluded patch 100% con-centration.

group as sodium lauryl sulfate. On the other hand, cocamidopropylamine oxide wasin the second most irritating group as was sodium cocoamphoacetate. A cationicpolymer (polyquaternium-7) and steartrimonium chloride were in the least irritatinggroup.The results of these tests show decreasing irritation with increasing molecularweight and are consistent with a maximum in irritation at 12 carbon atoms for thehydrophobe, since the coco hydrophobe is 50% C 12. Amphoteric surfactants aregenerally perceived to be mild to skin, because they function as anti-irritants in thepresence of anionics. However, the above data for amphoteric structures alone inthe absence of anionics shows that these surfactants can be irritating to skin.The anti-irritant effect produced by amphoteric surfactants is caused by molec-ular association. The irritating species in a surfactant system is the surfactant
monomer, not larger associated species such as aggregates. One of the effects ofamphoterics and amine oxides in the presence of anionics is to associate with theanionic resulting in a lower monomer concentration. Furthermore, the associatedspecies is larger and less irritating than surfactant monomer. Interestingly, today weview amphoteric surfactants as mild and as anti-irritants because they are generallyused in the presence of large amounts of anionic surfactants. If we formulateddifferently with an excess of amphoteric, then we would view anionics such assodium lauryl sulfate as anti-irritants and amphoterics as the irritating species.We usually associate anti-irritation with amphoteric surfactants; however, since
other types of surfactants, such as glucamide or alkyl poly glucoside (APG),perform this function and these are structurally not amphoterics or cationics,I would suggest that we call this type of surfactant a “pseudo-amphoteric” surfac-tant. Furthermore, I would propose that we promote the concept of classifyingsurfactants on the basis of their function rather than their structure. More on thissubject will be presented in the following sections.Most of the cationic surfactants that are used as conditioners in hair careproducts are high molecular weight species similar to steartrimonium chloride orpolyquaternium-7 and are used at low concentrations generally below the thresholdfor irritation.6.12.5.4 Molecular Weight (Size) and Skin IrritationDuring the course of our studies on skin irritation by surfactants, we made the
observation that there appeared to be a correlation in skin swelling with molecularweight of surfactants. The plot of Fig. 6.53 summarizes our data on skin swellingand molecular weight for 27 different anionic surfactants. These data show asigniﬁcant inverse relationship between surfactant molecular weight and skinswelling. The index of determination for this quadratic model is 0.7 suggestingthat 70% of the variation in skin swelling is explained by the variation in molecularweight. Since four surfactants tested here had hydrophobic chain lengths belowC12, an even greater molecular weight inﬂuence exists above that lower limit.6.12 Toxicity, Regulation, Product Safety and Skin Irritation 431
Although we have not tested this effect for other types of surfactants, it is clearthat molecular weight (as a rough approximation to molecular size) does explain alarge part of skin swelling and since skin swelling correlates with skin irritation bysurfactants; molecular weight must explain a large part of skin irritation. This isbecause the larger the size of the molecule, the slower its penetration across thestratum corneum into the living tissue and thus the less irritation produced. About30% of the variance is due to other factors, such as molecular shape and thehydrophilic functional group.6.12.5.5 Mathematical Model to Predict Skin IrritationThe relationship observed for the swelling of stratum corneum and skin irritationand the existence of a large amount of data on skin swelling provided encourage-ment to explore the possibility of a mathematical model to predict skin irritation ofmixed surfactant systems or products based on skin swelling data.
The ﬁrst step was to develop irritation constants for a large number of individualsurfactants. Crosswise swelling data conducted with rectangular pieces of humanstratum corneum on individual surfactants after soaking the skin in 1% samplesolutions at 40/C14C for 1,6 and 24 h were employed. Average swelling ratios werenormalized to a scale of 1.263 for sodium lauryl sulfate and 1.00 for water formingthe original scale. Normalization was necessary to compensate for variationbetween different skin samples used, for the large number of surfactants employed.At ﬁrst, normalized swelling values were only assumed to reﬂect irritation indices,however, later swelling values were shown to correlate with skin irritation rankingsFig. 6.53 Skin irritation and molecular weight of anionic surfactants. Note the decrease inirritation with increasing molecular weight (size)432 6 Interactions of Shampoo and Conditioner Ingredients with Hair
from in-vivo testing on humans by Spearmans Rank Correlation method, seeTable 6.26.Additional irritation indices were determined for anionic and neutral surfactantsuntil data from more than 20 different surfactants had been collected. For cationicand amphoteric surfactants, negative irritation indices were initially assigned avalue of /C010 (see Table 6.27). Later, charge density was used to more accuratelyestimate irritation indices of counter irritants assuming stoichiometric interactionbetween anionic and cationic or amphoteric detergents. With additional testing, afew surfactants such as APG, Monamate CPA-40 and Glucamide were found tointeract with anionic surfactants producing a mildness response and appropriateirritation indices had to be estimated for these, “pseudo-amphoteric” detergents.Although, several in-vitro methods have been used quite extensively to predict
irritation by products and individual surfactants, it is known that magnesium ioncan produce false mildness readings by many of these methods. Thus, the advantageof the calculation procedure that can be used to provide a more realistic predictionwhen ﬂaws of other methods provide false readings such as for pH extremes and theuse of divalent ions, at high concentrations, in the presence of anionic surfactants.To calculate relative irritation for products, simply take the sum of the irritationindex of each surfactant multiplied by its concentration (weight concentration) inthe product. Then multiply this sum by a normalization factor to place it on a scalebetween two known extremes in irritation for that product type. An example forshampoos is provided in Table 6.28 to illustrate this approach.The data of Table 6.28 show a signiﬁcant relationship between in-vivo irritationand calculated irritation scores. To calculate the irritation, all components at

concentrations of 1% or less are deleted unless they are cationics or amphoterics.Similar calculations have been shown to be feasible for light duty liquid dishdetergents and for bar products.The assumption of complete inhibition of irritation of anionics by amphotericsand cationics is obviously not valid, but for the most part this assumption does notprovide serious errors in calculation. Recently, we found that several neutralmolecules such as APG and glucamide possess anti-irritant properties (althoughnot to the same extent as amphoterics) and it is highly likely that other non-amphoterics behave similarly. To reﬁne these calculations further, more appropri-ate irritation indices for all anti-irritants should be determined empirically.6.12.6 Sensitization and PhototoxicitySensitization involves allergic reactions of the immune system. Sensitization is a
three step process with an initial exposure followed by an induction period thatinvolves the development of antibodies or lymphocytes in response to an antigen.Table 6.28 Calculation of potential irritation by shampoosaShampoo typeaCalculated irritation Calculated rank Actual irritation rankbI baby type 0.28 5 5II. 2 in 1 A 2.22 1 1III 0.86 4 4IV. 2 in 1 B 1.16 3 3V 1.72 2 2Shampoo I14% PEG-20 sorbitan laurate5% sodium trideceth-3 sulfate5% lauroamphoglycinate0.75% glycerineColors, preservative and fragranceShampoo II21% ammonium lauryl sulfate4% cocamideDEA2% 20–40 alcohols2% dimethiconeColors, preservative and fragranceShampoo III10% ammonium lauryl sulfate3% cocamide DEA2% cocamidopropylbetaineColors, preservative and fragranceShampoo IV14% ammonium laureth-2 sulfate4% sodium lauryl sulfate4% cocamidopropylbetaine2% cocamide MEA colors, preservative and fragranceShampoo V12% ammonium lauryl sulfate6% sodium laureth-2 sulfate2.5% dimethicone2% cocamideMEA

The induction period usually does not produce symptoms. The third step is calledthe challenge or elicitation reaction which occurs on subsequent treatments orexposures. Clinically, elicitation occurs about 2 weeks (10 days to 3 weeks) afterinduction. At this stage, an inﬂammatory response usually occurs, but if the“walling off” process is not effective, more severe symptoms result.In hair products, some ingredients known to be capable of producing sensitizationreactions are a few fragrance ingredients, formaldehyde and parabens (preservatives),and some hair dye components, such as p-phenylenediamine as shown by Marzulliand Maibach [ 207]. As indicated [ 208], the phenomenon of sensitization is concen-tration dependent so sensitizing materials can be used safely below a threshold level.For example, formaldehyde can be used at 0.1% or less in most products or even up to0.2% in a rinse-off product without producing or with minimal allergic response.
Even though p-phenylenediamine showed sensitization among 8% of panelists bypatch testing, in actual use in the presence of oxidizing agent and coupling agents, itsconcentration depletes very rapidly. Therefore, in actual hair dye use, in a short timeit is below its threshold value, thus accounting for the low incidence of allergicresponses among consumers of permanent hair dye products.Quenching described by Opdyke [ 209] is an interesting phenomenon of sensiti-zation. Quenching occurs when a known sensitizing agent is rendered non-sensitizing in the presence of other ingredients. Because of our current inabilityto predict quenching, testing of fully formulated products is preferred over testingof ingredients alone.Phototoxicity occurs when a combination of an ingredient plus light is necessary
to produce a toxic reaction. One example is photoirritation by Bergamot oil. Thisreaction is sometimes erroneously called photosensitization, however, it is actually aphotoirritation reaction caused by 5-methoxypsoralen in the fragrance oil and light.Harber and Baer [ 210] determined that some tetracyclines, sulfa drugs, some coal tarcomponents and the psoralens of fragrance oils are among the phototoxic ingredientscommonly used today. Bergamot oil is derived from the rind of the orange-like fruitof citrus bergamia cultivated in the south-western part of Italy. In the 1970s it was acommon component of fragrance formulations found in shampoos, lotions, creams,soaps and ﬁne fragrances as identiﬁed by Marzulli and Maibach [ 211].The mechanism of psoralen phototoxicity has been studied extensively.5-methoxy psoralen which is only 0.33% of Bergamot oil is believed by Grangeet al. [ 212] to be the principal phototoxic component of the oil. 5-Methoxy psoralen
absorbs ultraviolet light above 310 m mand is elevated to an excited state (freeradical). The psoralen radicals link to pyrimidine bases of DNA causing the releaseof histamine and the subsequent reactions of inﬂammation (burning and blistering).In extreme cases, further complications are possible. 5-Methoxy psoralen is largelyremoved from Bergamot oil by distillation; nevertheless, the oil’s use has declinedsubstantially.Other cosmetic ingredients, cited in the literature for phototoxic reactions, are6-methyl coumarin (formerly used as a fragrance component of sun protection andfacial products) and halogenated salicylanilides (previously used in antibacterialproducts such as deodorant soap bars) [ 211].6.12 Toxicity, Regulation, Product Safety and Skin Irritation 435
6.12.7 Safety Considerations for Shampoo and ConditionerProductsShampoos and conditioners when used for their intended purpose and in the mannerdescribed on the package label are among the safest consumer products sold today.Cautionary eye warning labels appear on most medicated products and on somecosmetic brands, attesting to the fact that eye irritation can occur if some productsaccidentally drain or spill into the eyes. Warnings against internal consumption alsoappear on many shampoo labels and on a few creme rinses or hair conditioners.Nevertheless, many conditioners contain no cautionary warnings, because they aremild and of such low toxicity.Bergfeld [ 213] reviewed the most frequent adverse effects of hair products from
patients at the Cleveland Clinic Dermatology Department over a 10-year period,and found relatively few adverse effects from shampoos. The majority of adverseeffects are due to sensitization rather than to irritation or hair breakage. Further-more, Bergfeld attributes these few adverse effects either to preservatives ormedicated ingredients of these products rather than to the active ingredients.Ishihara [ 214], in 1970, surveyed ﬁve large hospitals in Japan for contactdermatitis from hair products. Only 0.2% of cases of the total number of out-patients at all dermatologic clinics were admitted for adverse reactions to anyhair preparations. Only 0.008% of these adverse reactions were due to shampoos,and these few cases involved contact dermatitis. From these results, Ishiharaconcluded that most cases of contact dermatitis from shampoos and conditionersare not serious enough to be treated in a hospital.References1.

Chapter 7Dyeing Human HairAbstract The different types of dyes described for human hair include, permanentor oxidation dyes, semipermanent dyes, temporary dyes or color rinses and othertypes of dyes either proposed for or used on human hair. The mechanism ofoxidative dyeing of human hair is presented in detail describing a large numberof different dye precursors and couplers and how they combine to form differentdye species. Hydrogen peroxide and the new peroxymonocarbonate oxidativesystems are presented. Different matrix compounds used in hair dyeing are also
included. Regulatory activities related to oxidation hair dyes, described in thischapter, focus on the European community which has been the most active inthe regulation of oxidation dye ingredients and provides periodic updates on theCOLIPA website for safe and banned hair dye substances. Because of the increasein the aging population and the global sale of hair dye products to the grayingpopulation, a review of the initiation of hair graying including the age at whichgraying begins for different populations, the incidence of graying versus age in5 year increments for different populations and graying among different geo-racialgroups are also presented.7.1 Introduction
groups are also presented.7.1 IntroductionBecause of the increase in the aging population and the resultant graying of hair forall peoples of the world, the global sale of hair dye products has been increasing at afaster rate than many other hair care products. Therefore, a review of the incidenceof hair graying, graying versus age and graying among different geo-racial groups ispresented at the end of this chapter. Other areas of new research for this editiondescribed in this chapter include a means to minimize hydroxyl radical in oxidativehair dyeing, a new oxidative system and photoprotection of hair proteins. Fading ofartiﬁcial hair colors and effects of photoﬁlters on fading, regulatory methods, hairshine effects and dyeing, and a novel method for producing permanent dyed hairusing dye-metal ion complexes have also been included.C.R. Robbins, Chemical and Physical Behavior of Human Hair ,DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-25611-0_7, #Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012445
There are three ways to modify the color of hair: it may be made lighter bybleaching (see Chap. 5); artiﬁcial colors may be added to the hair; or a combinationof both of these methods may be employed. Adding color is the subject of thischapter. Hair coloring has been carried out for more than 2,000 years [ 1,2] usingvarious vegetable, mineral, and animal substances as coloring agents. Most of thedyes considered for human hair may be described as oxidation dyes, ionic dyes,metallic dyes, natural based hair colors, or reactive dyes.The classiﬁcation used for discussion in this chapter consists of four groups:Permanent or oxidation dyesSemipermanent dyesTemporary dyes or color rinsesOther dyesOxidation dyes are often referred to as permanent hair dyes and are the most
important of the commercial hair dyes. Permanent hair dyes generally consist ofp-diamines and p-aminophenols that are oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to activeintermediates [ 3]. These active intermediates then react inside the hair with colorcouplers to provide shampoo-resistant dyes.Semipermanent products consist of nitroaromatic amines or aromatic aminonitroanthroquinone dyes [ 4,5] that diffuse into and bind to the hair but do notbind ﬁrmly. Since these dyes are not ﬁrmly bound, they diffuse out of the hair withwater and shampooing and can be nearly completely removed after a few (4–6)shampoos. Temporary dyes or color rinses are acid dyes [ 6–8] similar to those usedin wool dyeing. However, because color rinses are used at room temperature, thedyes do not diffuse into the hair or bind ﬁrmly and they may be removed by a singleshampooing.Other dyes developed and described in the literature for hair include basic dyes
[9], metallic dyes, reactive dyes, vegetable dyes [ 2], and natural-based hair colorsdiscussed in the last part of this chapter. Wool dyeing is very different from hairdyeing because of the high temperatures involved in the former. In fact, lowtemperature dyeing in wool is 80–85/C14C. Solvent assist dyeing permits wool tobe dyed at 60–70/C14still too high a temperature for dyeing human hair. Prototypesystems have been developed based on chemistry related to that of naturalmelanin pigment formation [ 10]. These developmental systems may one daybecome commercial.Most hair dyeing processes are diffusion-controlled reactions and thereforeprovide a “ring dyeing” effect, see Figs. 7.1and7.2. The ring dyeing in Fig. 7.1was produced after 18 h reaction with methylene blue at high pH, a relativelycomplete dyeing process. Most commercial dyeing of hair provides a ring dyeingeffect, but to a lesser extent, more like that of Fig. 7.2produced by cetrimonium
chloride for 1 h at pH 9 and stained with Rubine dye.For forensic or commercial evaluations, light microscopy can determine whetheror not hair of unknown history has been dyed with a permanent hair dye or hasrecently been dyed with a semipermanent dye. Human scalp hair does not generallycontain pigment in the cuticle. Therefore, a light microscopic evaluation of ﬁber446 7 Dyeing Human Hair
cross-sections or even an optical section can reveal whether or not the hair inquestion has been treated with a commercial hair dye by determining if there isdye in the cuticle. The basic physical chemistry of the interactions of ionic dyeswith hair is related to that of ionic surfactants and is described in Chap. 6, includingdeﬁnitions for diffusion coefﬁcients, ion afﬁnities and experimental procedures todetermine these parameters of physical chemistry.7.2 Oxidation Dyes or Permanent Hair Dyes7.2.1 Compositions and Dyeing ConditionsOxidation hair dyes consist of dye precursors that form active intermediates, dyecouplers that condense with the active intermediates, an oxidizing agent (hydrogenFig. 7.1 Ring dyeing effect.Fibers treated with methyleneblue (18 h at pH 9).

peroxide), and matrix compounds consisting of surfactants, preservatives, andadditives for pH adjustment and ingredients for conditioning. These reactions areusually carried out at alkaline pH, generally from 8 to 10 [ 2,11–14]. By adjustingthe proportions of oxidant, precursors, and couplers, the hair may be made lighter ordarker in one process. Oxidation dye precursors are derivatives of aniline (seeTable 7.1). Precursors are difunctional ortho- or para-diamines or aminophenolsthat are capable of oxidizing to diiminium (IX) or quinoniminium (X) ions,proposed by Corbett [ 3] as the active intermediates of this process.NNH HHNNH HH ONH H+++Diiminium ion of p-phenylenediamine (IX)Quinoniminium ion ofp-aminophenol (X)Table 7.1 Some oxidationdye precursors448 7 Dyeing Human Hair
This paper [ 3] by Corbett is an excellent review of the chemistry of oxidativedyeing. Oxidation dye couplers are electron-rich aromatic species. They are com-monly substituted resorcinols or meta-phenylenediamines, usually containing avacant position para to the amine or phenolic group (see Table 7.2). Oxidationdye precursors, when oxidized in the absence of couplers, form colored compounds,usually gray or brown-black shades. On the other hand, couplers themselves usuallyproduce little or no color, but in the presence of precursors and oxidizing agent, theymodify the color formed by the precursor. The ingredients above are described in[2,14–19] and on product ingredient labels.Most oxidation dye formulations contain two or three or more ingredients thatact as either dye precursors or couplers. Therefore, several reactions are involved,and multiple dye products are formed for each hair color formulation. As indicated
before, hydrogen peroxide is usually the oxidizing agent of choice for oxidative hairdyeing. However, peracids [ 3], and autoxidation [ 19] or air oxidation of the highlyelectron-rich dye precursors or oxidation with a mixture of ammonium carbonatewith hydrogen peroxide and glycine [ 20] have also been used. This latter system isbelieved to function by the formation of peroxymonocarbonate and offers someadvantages [ 20].Table 7.2 Some oxidationdye couplersaThese and other couplers are described in References 2and or14–19and on product labels7.2 Oxidation Dyes or Permanent Hair Dyes 449
OH2O2  + -O-C-OH -O-C-OOH   +    H2OperoxymonocarbonateOOxidation by hydrogen peroxide in oxidation dyes is generally performed at apH of 10 /C60.2. This pH involves the hydroperoxide anion as the primary activeoxidizing species. However, Marsh et al. [ 21] have shown that when redox metalssuch as copper or iron are present in the hair or the water supply, free radicalreactions can also occur involving the very active and destructive hydroxyl radical.These same scientists also demonstrated that some of the oxidative damage by thehydroxyl free radical can be reduced by including certain chelants in the oxidativesystem [ 21]. For a more comprehensive discussion of the effects of oxidationreactions on hair see Chap. 5.Another advantage offered by the peroxymonocarbonate system is that similar
hair lightening to that of hydrogen peroxide at pH 10 can be achieved by signiﬁ-cantly lower pH’s because of peroxymonocarbonate’s lower pKa (3.8 and 10.3[22]) versus 11.75 for hydrogen peroxide [ 23]. The higher pH required for hydrogenperoxide is because the active species in its reactions is likely the hydroperoxideanion which is only 50% of the peroxide at its PKa, whereas the monoanionicperoxymonocarbonate species is active and it is essentially fully ionized at pH 8 andhigher. Furthermore the peroxymonocarbonate system has been shown to providemaximum lightening between pH 9 and 9.5 and it decreases with further increasingpH. This effect is most likely due to the formation of the dianion (pKa 10.3) whichis a less effective oxidizing agent for hair pigments.Even though hydrogen peroxide or peroxymonocarbonate are the oxidizingagents of choice for oxidative dyeing, peracids [ 3], and autoxidation [ 19] or air
oxidation of highly electron-rich dye precursors have also been used. The nature ofthe autoxidation process must be analogous to the self-condensation reactionsdescribed for dye precursors in the next section. Internal cyclization of the dinuclearindo dye will also occur frequently [ 19]. A few trisubstituted benzene derivativesand analogous naphthalenes [ 19,24] and quinolines have also been described alongwith some of the dye products for autoxidative dyeing, but this is clearly not apreferred process.Modern oxidation dyes sometimes contain coloring agents in addition to dyeprecursors and couplers; for example, direct dyes like disperse blue 1 and nitro-phenylenediamines are sometimes included.One might predict that these ingredients could enter into oxidation dye reactions,
but because the strong electron-withdrawing nitro or anthraquinone groups arepresent, these groups should decrease the rates of oxidation and coupling of thesespecies below that of oxidation dye reactants. Thus, these dyes probably functionprimarily as direct color modiﬁers.450 7 Dyeing Human Hair

This active intermediate then condenses withan electron-rich dye coupler, forming a dinuclear product that is oxidized to an indodye. This reaction may stop at the dinuclear dye stage, or additional condensation-
oxidation reactions may occur, forming trinuclear or even polynuclear dyes andpigments [ 3,25]. More detailed mechanisms describing the formation of these andother indo dye products are presented in the next section.Because most oxidation dye products co ntain 5–7 or more ingredients capableof acting as either dye couplers or precur sors, mixtures of di-, tri-, and poly-nuclear indo dyes are formed in these reactions. In addition, it is conceivablethat nucleophilic groups in hair might even add to the indo dyes, covalentlybonding dye molecules to the hair. Pen etration of the dye precursors and thecouplers can occur, but penetration must be limited to the outer regions of the hair,since the condensation rea ctions that occur are relatively fast compared withdiffusion, and the larger condensation pr oducts (at least in the hair) are resistantto shampooing.7.2 Oxidation Dyes or Permanent Hair Dyes 451
7.2.3 Mechanisms for Oxidation Dye Reactions7.2.3.1 The Active Intermediates in Oxidation Dye ReactionsThe diimine (XXII) has been described as a vital intermediate in oxidative hairdyeing [ 26]. Subsequently, Corbett [ 3] described the protonated diimine (IX) as thereactive species that actually attacks dye coupling agents, ultimately forming indodyes.NNHHNNHHHNNHHHH+Diimine of (I) Diiminium ion of (XXII)(IX) (XXII)Certainly diiminium ions are more electrophilic and are therefore more capableof serving as the active species in these reactions than diimines. As such, diiminiumions are described as the active intermediates in the mechanisms considered in theTable 7.3 Scheme and examples of indo dyes formed in oxidative hair dyeingPolynuclear indo dye from (I)and resorcinol  (XX) [25]Dinuclear indo dye from (I) and4-Substituted m-phenylenediamines (XIX)Trinuclear dye from (I) and resorcinol (XXI) [26]O HONRNDi, Tri, & Polynuclear Indo Dyes (Below)

subsequent discussions. By analogy, quinoniminium ions, such as (X), would be theactive intermediates formed from ortho- and para-aminophenols. If one assumesthat diimines are formed by two one-electron transfer reactions [ 27,28] with theloss of two protons, and that the entire sequence occurs stepwise, then a diiminiumion is formed before diimine.Although diimines may form in these interactions, they are not necessaryintermediates for forming the di-, tri-, and polynuclear indo dyes that havebeen shown to form. For example, compound (XXIII), an N,N-dialkyl-substitutedp-phenylenediamine, has been used in several commercial hair dyes in the past.This species should be capable of forming a diiminium ion (XXIV), although itcannot form a corresponding diimine. One might speculate that (XXIII) functionsonly as a dye coupler; however, related N,N-dialkyl p-phenylenediamines have
been used with common dye couplers (in the absence of unsubstitued p-phenylene-diamines). This ﬁnding suggests that this type of species does act as a dye precursorin oxidative hair dyeing [ 8,29,30].NH2NOHHONNHOHHOOxidation(XXIII) (XXIV)+NH2NH2 NH2NH HNNHH HNNHH HNNHH. .++(I) Wurster Salt   (XXV) -e-H+-H+Diimine+Diiminium ion (IX)7.2 Oxidation Dyes or Permanent Hair Dyes 453
Mechanisms may also be written involving Wurster salts (XXV) to providethe di-, tri-, and polynuclear indo dyes for these reactions. Lee and Adams [ 31]generated the Wurster salt of p-phenylenediamine by electrochemical oxidationin buffered media. Above pH 6, the radical stability decreases rapidly, indicatingthe low stability of these species under hair-dyeing conditions. Therefore, thediiminium ion is more likely the active intermediate in actual hair dyeing.For the following discussion, a ﬁve-step reaction mechanism explains the for-mation of di-, tri-, and polynuclear indo dyes that have been isolated from oxidationdye reactions.Step 1: Formation of the diiminium ion from the dye precursor.Step 2: The diiminium ion attacks a coupler (generally para to an amino orphenolic group), forming a dinuclear species.H2NH2NNHOR H_ +Dinuclear Speciesm-Aminophenolate ionStep 3: Oxidation of the dinuclear species to a dinuclear indo dye then occurs.

This diimine can then condense withp-phenylenediamine to form Bandrowski’s base (XXVI) a brown-black indo dye.A great deal of discussion and work concerning the actual chemical structure454 7 Dyeing Human Hair
[33–35] and importance of Bandrowski’s base to oxidative dyeing has taken place[33,34]. Altman and Rieger [ 33] and Dolinsky et al. [ 34] independently providedevidence that the structure shown (XXVI) represents the correct tautomer, incontrast to the structure proposed earlier by Bandrowski [ 35]. Altman and Riegeralso suggested that Bandrowski’s base is probably the end product of an undesirableside reaction in hair dyeing but is not the main colorant of hair dyed withp-phenylenediamine. Corbett [ 3] conﬁrmed this conclusion by showing thatmodern dye couplers are several orders of magnitude more reactive to diiminiumion than is p-phenylenediamine. These facts preclude the formation of signiﬁcantquantities of Bandrowski’s base in modern oxidation dyes.NNHHNNNH2NH2NH2H2NDiimine (XXII) Bandrowski's Base (XXVI)The formation of Bandrowski’s base may be described by a mechanism consis-tent with the general scheme described in the previous section.
7.2.3.3 Polyindophenols from Resorcinol and P-PhenylenediamineResorcinol is one of the components of many oxidation dyes, and as such isprobably the most commonly used oxidation dye coupler. Brody and Burns [ 25]have shown that p-phenylenediamine, in the absence of hair and phenols, isoxidized to Bandrowski’s base. However, when resorcinol is present, polyindo-phenols (XX) are formed, and the formation of Bandrowski’s base is effectivelyprevented [ 25]. These brown polymeric polyindophenol pigments have beenidentiﬁed by elemental analysis, acetyl values, and hydrolysis to p-phenylenediamine.Low-molecular-weight di- and trinuclear species were not detected by Brody andBurns. However, Shah et al. [ 36] isolated a green pigment from hair dyed withmixtures of p-phenylenediamine and resorcinol and identiﬁed this pigment as thetrinuclear indophenol (XXI).Trinuclear green pi gment from p-phen ylenediamine & resorcinol (XXI)O NH2 NH2NHHON7.2 Oxidation Dyes or Permanent Hair Dyes 455
The following scheme describes the formation of the trinuclear green pigmentand polyindophenols from (I) and resorcinol and is consistent with the generalmechanism described earlier. This scheme suggests that the diiminium ion (IX) isthe active species, and its formation has already been described. In Step 2, thiselectrophilic species attacks a resorcinol anion, para to the phenolic group, forming(XXVII), which is oxidized to indophenol in Step 3.NH2NH2NH2NH2H2N H2NH2NNHHOHOHOOHNHOOH ONNONH HHStep 1Oxidation+Step 2Resorcinol anionBrownPolymericPolyindophenolsIndophenol [O]Step 3[O]IndophenolStep 4[PPD] Indophenol[O]Trinuclear green pigment (XXI)[O]Indophenol[O]Step 5(XXVII)In Step 4, p-phenylenediamine adds to the indophenol in a 1,4 manner [ 28,37],
producing the trinuclear species (XXVIII), which is then oxidized to the trinucleargreen pigment (XXI). Several routes exist for formation of polymeric indophenols.All of these routes are analogous to steps 4 and 5. Repetition of these steps results inthe formation of higher polymers. Because most oxidation dyes contain bothp-phenylenediamine and resorcinol, the formation of these tri- and polynuclearpigments is important to the oxidative dyeing of human hair.7.2.3.4 Indamines from M-PhenylenediaminesIn addition to resorcinol, 4-methoxy m-phenylenediamine has been an importantdye coupler, and is representative of the class of m-phenylenediamine couplingagents.456 7 Dyeing Human Hair

Mechanistically, the formation of2-aminoindamines is related to the formation of indophenols and ﬁts the generalscheme described earlier.When the R group of structure (XXX) is methoxy, it represents the structuralformula for the 2-aminoindamine of p-phenylenediamine and 4-methoxym-phenylenediamine, which is a relatively stable dye. Other, less frequentlyused m-phenylenediamines form unstable blue dyes that cyclize internally at highhumidities, forming red 2,8-diaminophenazines [ 3].The parent compound m-phenylenediamine reacts with (I) to produce a trimer(XXXI) analogous to the trinuclear green pigment that has been isolated fromresorcinol and p-phenylenediamine [ 3].NNNH2 H2N H2N NHH

If the Rsubstituent of (XXXII) is (almost anything but hydrogen), the reaction generallystops at the dimer stage. However, if R is hydrogen, it adds another molecule of (I)at the 4 position and is oxidized to a trimeric indo dye [ 3], analogous to the trimericpigment of (I) and resorcinol; see structure (XXI).

Hydroquinones probably form dinuclear dyes analogous to (XXXVIII) andthen stop at this stage, whereas the parent compound (unsubstituted hydroquinone)probably forms analogous dinuclear species and even trinuclear dyes (XXXIX)analogous to Bandrowski’s base.7.3 Matrix CompoundsMatrix compounds in hair dyeing consist of surfactants, emulsiﬁers, preservatives,conditioning agents and additives for pH control/adjustment. They are essentiallynon-color additives that are functional in hair dyes, see Table 7.4. Vincent et al. [ 39]described a procedure for the extraction of matrix compounds from oxidation hairdyes to allow for the clean chromatographic separation of hair dye compoundsfor analysis. These same three scientists [ 40] have provided a reference methodto allow for the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of hair dye forming agents. Thismethod was developed to be used for the European regulatory enforcement of thesetypes of products.7.4 The Formulation of Permanent Hair Dyes
7.4 The Formulation of Permanent Hair DyesPermanent hair dyes should be formulated with two different compositions or parts.The ﬁrst composition is a precursor-coupler base containing surfactants (to helpdissolve the precursors and couplers, to assist in spreading the dye evenly over thehair, and to help thicken the product so it does not run down the face during use),alkalinity (to facilitate the oxidation reaction), a low concentration of a reducingagent (to inhibit oxidation of the precursors by air), the precursors and couplers, andwater. The second composition is an oxidizing base containing oxidizing agent,stabilizer (for the peroxide), and sometimes surfactant (for thickening during use),see Table 7.5.To formulate the foregoing hair precursor-coupler bases, add the sulfonate andneodol to water with stirring at room temperature. Add the sodium sulﬁte (reducingagent-stabilizer) and then the dye precursors and couplers, stirring until theyTable 7.4 Some matrix

dissolve completely. Then, add the alkalinity, followed by the amide, whereuponthe product will thicken. The oxidizer base is detailed in Table 7.6. In some cases,the dye precursors and couplers should be dissolved in the amide and then the otheringredients added as above.To formulate the oxidizer base, dissolve the sulfonate in water with stirring atroom temperature. Add the phosphoric acid to the peroxide separately. Lastly, addthis mixture slowly to the detergent in water with stirring.7.5 Usage InstructionsUse of this type of product consists of three steps: the allergy test, the strand test,and application to the hair on the head.7.5.1 The Allergy Test

If anyitching, redness, burning, or any other allergic symptom is noticed, do not use theproduct. However, if there is no allergic reaction, apply the product.Table 7.5 Precursor-coupler baseaIngredient Percent of ingredient for desired hair colorDark brown Light brown Red BlackDodecyl benzene Sulfonate 14 14 14 14Cocodiethanolamide 9 9 9 9Neodol 91-2.5 6 6 6 6Ammonium Hydroxide 666 6Sodium sulﬁte 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3p-Phenylenediamine 0.4 – – 0.4o-Aminophenol 0.3 0.4 – 0.2p-Aminophenol – 0.4 0.4 –4-Methyl-5-aminophenol – – 0.4 –m-Aminophenol – – – 0.2Water 64 63.9 63.9 63.9aThe colors listed can be achieved when starting with naturally light blonde hair.

The European community has been the most active region with respect to theregulation of oxidation dye ingredients. In the late 1980s more than 150 oxidationdye couplers and precursors combined were listed for use in the European CosmeticDirective. As of this writing, a proposal by COLIPA (Comite de Liaison Europeende Industrie de la Parfumarie de Produits Cosmetiques et de Toilette) contains only25 of these, see Table 7.7and more than half of these ingredients require furthertesting to actually remain on this list permanently.COLIPA has a website ( www.colipa.eu/hair-dyes.html ) that is worth followingfor anyone in the hair dye industry. On this website at the bottom of the page is alink to hair dyes that contains several important objectives and lists for thoseconcerned with hair dyes. There is an Assessment Strategy for Hair Dyes Safety ,and a List of 44 positively assessed hair dye substances by the SCCP (updated:
January 2009), a List of provisionally allowed substances (62) (Updated: November2006). a List of 117 hair dye substances with an updated safety ﬁle (Updated:November 2006), a List of 135 banned hair dye substances (Updated: September2007), a List of 49 hair dye substances proposed for ban (Updated: September2007), and Guidance Document to the Commission Directive 2007/54/EC of 29August 2007 (ban of 85 hair dyes).One concern however is the lack of solidarity that exists in Europe concerningregulatory matters. For example, 1-nitro-p-phenylenediamine is banned in Italy, butit is listed by COLIPA as safe, see Table 7.7. Another example of the independenceof many European countries in regulatory matters is one that created confusion
in the surfactant arena just a few years ago. For example, there were labelingrequirements for LAS (linear alkyl benzene sulfonate) in Scandinavia, but not forthe remainder of Europe. These labeling requirements created problems for mar-keting Pan-European products containing surfactants. Hopefully such emotionaland independent decision making will not prevail in hair dyes too. The status of the462 7 Dyeing Human Hair
regulatory process for hair dyes in Europe is worth following especially for anycompany concerned with the global marketing of hair dyes.7.7 Synopsis of Oxidation Dyeing of Human HairOxidative dyeing consists of treating hair with an oxidizing system and dyeprecursors and couplers. Up to this time, the primary oxidizing agent is hydrogenperoxide with alkalinity (ammonia or ethanolamine) and the dye precursors andcouplers. The pH of these systems is about 10 /C60.2. The oxidizing system hastwo functions: One is to decolorize the hair pigments and thus lighten the hair inpreparation for the colors. Second, the oxidizing system oxidizes the dye precursorsto diiminium ion active ingredients as described in the previous sections. Bleachingof the hair pigments is critical to the coloring process especially for lighter orblonde shades. But, bleaching can produce damage to the hair proteins and lipidssee Chap. 5.
The literature on the interactions of oxidation dyes shows that dye precursorsand dye couplers are both involved. Dye precursors are oxidized to active interme-diates, probably diiminium or quinoniminium species. These active intermediatesreact with resorcinol to form polyindophenols, trinuclear and polynuclear dyes,with m-diamines to form indamines, with m-aminophenols to form indamines; andwith naphthol and hydroquinone to form indophenols. Bandrowski’s base is atrinuclear species, the product of a side reaction that does not occur to a signiﬁcantextent in oxidative dyeing.Table 7.7 Oxidation dye ingredients proposed for the future positive hair dye list by COLIPAA.

These products do not use hydrogen peroxide todevelop the hair color [ 5]. For this type of product, preformed hair dyes arerequired. Table 7.8depicts chemical structures of some dyes currently used insemipermanent hair dye products. To achieve the desired shade, each productcontains a combination of up to as many as 18 hair dyes [ 41,42] similar to those
described in Table 7.8. Other ingredients in these products are matrix compounds,such as, solvents (primarily water and glycols or glycol derivatives), surfactant(s),amide, fragrance and acid or alkali for pH adjustment.Semipermanent hair dyes are generally applied to freshly shampooed hair andallowed to remain on the hair for approximately 20 min. The hair is then rinsed withwater. Often a “conditioner,” is packaged with the product. After application of thedye and rinsing the conditioner is added and the hair rinsed again and driedgenerally without shampooing.7.8.1 Formulation of Semipermanent Hair DyesTo formulate the dye products described in Table 7.9, ﬁrst dissolve the sulfate inwater, and then add the sulfonate, the neodol and the amide while stirring. Add thedyes and stir until they are completely dissolved. Alternatively, the dyes may bedissolved in the amide and/or the neodol and then added to the anionic surfactantsin water.464 7 Dyeing Human Hair

7.8.2 Usage Instructions for Semipermanent Hair DyesThere are three basic steps to the usage instructions for this type of product: ﬁrst, theallergy test; second, the strand test (both are described under the formulation ofpermanent hair dyes); and third, the actual application of the product to the hair. Toapply a semipermanent hair dye, ﬁrst shampoo the hair, rinse, and towel dry.Thoroughly saturate the hair with the product, using plastic gloves, being carefulto minimize contact of the dye solution with the scalp. Allow the product to reactwith the hair for about 30 min or the time indicated by the strand test. After rinsing,a cre`me rinse/conditioner may be added to the hair, which is then lathered andrinsed. On the other hand, the hair may be rinsed thoroughly with water, but notshampooed. It is then set and styled as usual.In summary, semipermanent hair dyes are products that last through four to six
shampoos. They are mixtures of preformed dyes generally with 10–18 dyes mixedto achieve the desired shade. These dyes are generally mononuclear, dinuclear,or trinuclear species and are usually aromatic amines, amino nitrobenzenes, oranthraquinone derivatives. These dyes generally diffuse into hair and are retainedby weak polar and Van der Waals attractive forces. Therefore, the afﬁnity of thedyestuff generally increases with increasing molecular size. Peroxide is not used todevelop the color. Therefore, no “major” chemical changes occur to the ﬁbersduring this type of dyeing.7.8.3 Color Fading and Light Fastness of Permanent andSemipermanent Dyes7.8.3.1 Semipermanent Dyes and Rinse-OutThe hair dyes of Table 7.8generally consist of neutral aromatic amine, nitroaromatic amine, or anthraquinone derivatives. They are all highly polar ingredientsand can be classiﬁed as mono-, di-, or trinuclear (ring) dyes. Wong [ 43] studied the
kinetics of dye removal from hair for this type of hair dye. He concluded that underall conditions the larger, trinuclear dyes rinse more slowly from hair than thesmaller, mononuclear dyes.For both bleached and unbleached hair, Wong [ 43] showed that dye rinse-out forsmall dye molecules (corresponding to the mononuclear species) of semipermanenthair dyes is diffusion controlled with relatively weak dye-to-hair interactions.Han et al. [ 44] conﬁrmed this ﬁnding in a study of the diffusion of HC Red 3(Table 7.8) into and out of hair. For a discussion of techniques to determinediffusion coefﬁcients, see Chap. 6. These workers found essentially no hysteresisin the adsorption vs. desorption kinetics, suggesting weak binding betweenthis mononuclear dye and hair. Han et al. [ 44] indicated that HC Red 3 has apKaof 3.7. Therefore, this dye is not positively charged under hair-dyeing466 7 Dyeing Human Hair
conditions, but is neutral. Thus charge-charge interactions are not involved in thebinding of this dye to hair. This factor helps to explain the weak binding foundbetween this dye and hair.Wong [ 43] also found that the larger trinuclear dyes, analogous to those ofTable 7.8, have a higher afﬁnity for hair than the simple mononuclear dyesundoubtedly arising from a larger number of polar and Van der Waals bindingsites between dye and hair.The principles of this study by Wong are being utilized today in semiperma-nent hair dye products in the following manner. It is well known that diffusioninto hair and removal of dye are faster in weathered tip ends than in the root ends[5]. Thus, blends of dyes are used not only to obtain the right blend at root and tip,but to provide a more even wash fastness in both root and tip ends. For example,blends of single ring dyes diffuse more re adily into and are retained more readily
in root ends, whereas blends of dinuclear and trinuclear dyes are retained morereadily in tip ends [ 45]. Thus the proper blending of mononuclear and dinuclearwith trinuclear dyes will provide a more even wash fastness to both root and tipregions of hair.Han et al. [ 44] further found that the diffusion coefﬁcient of the mononuclear HCRed 3 increased with pH, with dye concentration (1.0–5.0 g/l), and with increasingtemperature (25–60/C14C). When the dye bath solvent was changed from water to 50
volume percent aqueous ethanol dye uptake decreased. However, the diffusioncoefﬁcients remained similar in magnitude. The pH effect can be explained byincreased swelling of the hair. The dye concentration and temperature effects areconsistent with expectation for a diffusion-controlled interaction. The solvent effectoccurs because the dye is more soluble in the ethanol-water system than in wateralone, thereby increasing the afﬁnity of dye for the solvent phase relative to thekeratin, causing more of the dye to partition into the aqueous-ethanol phase and lessinto the hair.Blankenburg and Philippen [ 46], using a scanning photometer microscope,studied the reaction of this same dye with hair. These scientists demonstratedmaximum absorption of dye near the ﬁber exterior. Whereas at longer dyeingtimes the dyestuff concentration in the center of the ﬁber increased. In all cases,ring dyeing was observed; see Figs. 7.1and7.2. These results are consistent with a
diffusion-controlled process.Wong [ 43] found that for the smaller mononuclear dyes, bleaching increased therate of dye rinse-out. However, for the larger dyes, the rinse-out rate decreased witha small amount of bleaching, and went through a minimum until the rinse-out ratebegan to increase with bleaching. Wong suggested that with a small amount ofbleaching the larger dyes are able to reach more hindered positions in the hairsubstrate. Therefore, with a small amount of bleaching the dyes bind more ﬁrmlyand are more difﬁcult to remove with rinsing. However, with additional bleaching,the hair becomes more penetrable, and the rinse-out rate of the larger dyes increasesbut never approaches the rinse-out rates for smaller dyes.7.8 Semipermanent Hair Dyes 467
7.8.3.2 Dye Color and Light Stability of Semipermanent DyesCorbett [ 45] related dye color and light stability of some semipermanent hair dyesto dye structure. With regard to light-fastness, Corbett demonstrated that formonosubstituted nitrobenzene dyes, the ortho-substituted dyes are the most stableto light and the para-substituted the least light-stable. For nitrobenzene dyescontaining two electron-donating substituents, those with 2,5 substitution are themost light stable, while those with 2,4 and 3,4 substitution are less stable to light.7.8.3.3 The Mechanism of Fading of Highly Colored Indo DyesAlthough this phenomenon has not been studied at length, Corbett [ 3] proposedthat fading of indo dyes most likely involves the addition of aromatic moities todinuclear indo dyes, together with hydrolytic degradation to p-diamines andhydroxybenzoquinones that further degrade.7.8.3.4 Fading of Permanent Hair Dyes by Shampoos and Light
Red or auburn hair dyes have been shown to fade more than other shades. Pyrazolederivatives such as 1-hydroxyethyl-4,5-diamino pyrazole sulfate produce the mostvivid red colors although non-pyrazole red dyes are generally based on 4-amino-2-hydroxy toluene or 2-methyl-1-napthol as red couplers [ 47]. Furthermore, colorfading has been shown to be greatest by UVB and least by IR. For example, thecolor fading order is: UVB >UVA>Visible >IR [44]. However, these relativefading effects in actual practice have been found to be very different from thisranking because of the differences in the relative intensities of the various portionsof natural sunlight in different parts of the world. As a result, the contributions ofUVB and UVA depends on radiation time (63% at 16 h and 27% at 48 h), and thegreatest effect is from visible light [ 48]. Therefore blocking UV light can produce asigniﬁcant decrease in color fading but will not completely suppress color loss.
Locke and Jachowicz [ 49] demonstrated that greater fading or color loss isproduced by a combination of shampooing and light radiation versus light radiationalone. Furthermore, these scientists concluded that color fading is related to thetype of hair used. For example, the greatest fading occurs with natural white orbleached hair compared with brown hair. Furthermore, they calculated that use of aUVB photoﬁlter such as octyl methoxy cinnamate on hair at a level as high as30 mg/gm hair will absorb less than 25% of the total UV radiation, but UVAabsorbers will absorb about 40% of UV at the same high concentration.468 7 Dyeing Human Hair
7.8.4 Analysis of Semipermanent Hair DyesSeveral scientiﬁc studies have been concerned with the application of high-performance liquid chromatography for analysis of direct dyes in semipermanenthair coloring products primarily for quality control purposes [ 42,50]. This techniquehas been used successfully for the complete separation of 18 dyes in a standardmixture. It has also been applied to the separation and analysis of these dyes in eightcommercial hair coloring products.7.9 Temporary Hair Dyes or Color RinsesThe objective of temporary hair dyes is to provide color to the hair; color that iscapable of being shampooed out of the hair with a single shampooing. Table 7.10depicts structures for a few hair-coloring ingredients used in today’s hair rinses.A large number of hair color ingredients previously used in color rinses aredescribed in the article by Wall on hair dyes [ 51]. Each color rinse product consistsTable 7.10 Some haircolor ingredients usedin color rinse products
color ingredients usedin color rinse products7.9 Temporary Hair Dyes or Color Rinses 469
of a mixture of color additives, either among those described in Table 7.10 orsimilar FD&C or D&C colors. Generally two to ﬁve color ingredients are mixed toachieve the desired shade [ 51], because a single ingredient generally will notprovide the desired color to the hair. Two dyes are sometimes used to providetints for gray hair; four to ﬁve dyes are generally mixed to achieve reds, browns, orblack.These products are usually applied to freshly shampooed hair and combedthrough. An alternative is to spray the product onto the hair and comb it into thehair to achieve even distribution of the dyes. The hair is then set and dried withoutrinsing to minimize penetration of dyes into the ﬁbers. The dyes used in color rinsesare generally larger molecular species than those used in semipermanent hair dyeproducts. Color rinse dyes are generally anionic or acid dyes, see Table 7.10, and
are similar to those used in wool dyeing. These dye ingredients are selected toprovide maximum water solubility and minimum penetration so they can beshampooed out of the hair. Wool dyeing is very different from hair dyeing primarilybecause of the temperatures employed. In fact, low temperature dyeing in wool is80–85/C14C. Solvent assist dyeing permits dyeing wool at 60–70/C14C, which is still toohigh for human hair. For a more complete discussion of the dyeing of wool ﬁber, seethe book Wool Dyeing edited by D.M. Lewis [ 52].Some other dyes used in this type of product are direct black 51, direct red 80,acid black 2, D&C yellow No. 10, and other FD&C and D&C dyes.7.9.1 Formulation of Color Rinses
7.9.1 Formulation of Color RinsesTemporary hair dye products frequently contain thickeners, a surfactant, sometimesa hair-setting polymer, and a buffer or acid such as tartaric, acetic, or citric toprovide an acidic medium for application of the dyes to the hair. To make the hairrinses described in Table 7.11, ﬁrst hydrate the hydroxyethylcellulose (0.7 g) with49 g of water by stirring. Next, add the neodol and the nonoxynol. Then add theremaining water followed by the buffer. Next, slowly dissolve the dyes in theproduct with stirring. Finally, add the cetrimonium chloride and stir until it iscompletely dissolved.7.9.2 Usage of Color RinsesFirst shampoo the hair with a good cleaning shampoo. Rinse the hair thoroughlyand towel dry. Thoroughly saturate the hair with the product, using plastic gloves ifdesired, being careful to minimize contact with the scalp. Dry the hair and style asdesired.470 7 Dyeing Human Hair
7.10 Other Dyes for Hair7.10.1 Metallic DyesSalts of several metals including lead, silver, bismuth, cobalt, copper, iron, andmercury have been used in the past for dyeing hair [ 53]. Among these metallic dyes,lead dyes are the only ones in commercial use today. Lead dyes contain lead acetateand sulfur and react with hair to darken it slowly, presumably forming lead-sulfurcomplexes in the cuticle layers. The listing of lead acetate as a hair color additivein cosmetics in described in this Federal Register listing [ 54]. These products arepopular among men because of the slow gradual buildup of color (Table 7.12).However, shades are limited for lead dyes, and the dye can react if treated sub-sequently with bleaches, permanent waves, and even with certain other hair dyes[16] (Table 7.12).7.10.2 Formulation of a Lead Acetate-Sulfur Hair DyeDissolve the lead acetate in water with stirring. Disperse the sulfur in propylene
glycol and add this dispersion to the lead acetate in water while stirring vigorously.Continue to stir while adding the fragrance and preservative that is previouslydissolved in alcohol and the surfactant.Another form of metallic dye is called premetalized dyes. These compoundsare metal complexes of anionic dyes with chromium, cobalt, or some other metal,Table 7.11 Prototype hair rinse formulationsaIngredients Percent of ingredients for desired hair colorBrown Red WhiteNonoxynol-9 1.0 1.0 1.0Hydroxyethylcellulose(HHR) 0.7 0.7 0.7Cetrimonium chloride 0.6 0.6 0.6Neodol 91-2.5 0.5 0.5 0.5Citric acid trihydrate 0.5 – 0.5Trisodium phosphate – 0.3 –Direct black 51 0.5 0.01 –Acid violet 43 0.04 0.03 –Direct red 80 0.03 0.05 –Acid orange 24 0.04 0.02 –External D&C violet 2 – – 0.03D&C red 33 – – 0.01FD&C yellow 6 – – 0.005D&C yellow 10 – – 0.005Water 96.54 96.79 96.657.10 Other Dyes for Hair 471
generally in a ratio of 1:2 (metal:dye); see structure (XXXX) [ 55–57]. Some tradenames are Irgalan, Cibalan, Lanasyn, Carbolan, and Isolan. Premetalized dyes havebeen patented and described for use with hair [ 58,59]. Premetalized dyes are oftenclassiﬁed as acid dyes rather than as metallic dyes, even though from substantivityand bonding considerations they are probably more like metallic dyes. The use ofpremetalized dye in the presence of an alcohol (benzyl or amyl) is called solventassist dyeing [ 56]. Solvent assist dyeing is an interesting technique that produces alarger uptake of dye relative to a pure aqueous solvent and has been described inpatents on human hair.ONNOSO3MSO3MONNOCr(XXXX)7.10.3 Novel Permanent Dye Using a Dye-Metal Ion ComplexOchiai et al. [ 60] reported that permanent dyes can be developed in hair usingdye-metal ion complexes. These scientists used aluminum chloride as the metal ion
which was allowed to penetrate into the hair so that the aluminum ion couldcomplex with the acid dyes in the hair. Benzyl alcohol and ethanol were employedas penetration enhancers to provide for deeper penetration of the dyes. The advan-tage to this type of system, if it is effective, is that it would appear to provide colorpermanence to the hair without oxidative damage.Table 7.12 Lead acetate-sulfur hair dyeIngredient PercentageSulfur (ﬁnely divided) 1.0Lead acetate 1.0Nonoxynol-9 0.8Denatonium benzoate 0.5Fragrance 0.2Propylene glycol 20.0Ethanol 3.0Water 73.5472 7 Dyeing Human Hair
7.10.4 Vegetable DyesNatural organic substances from plants are the earliest known hair dyes. But, of themany substances of this type that have been tried over the years, only henna andcamomile are currently used to a signiﬁcant commercial extent [ 2]. The activecoloring material of henna (Lawsone) is 2-hydroxy-1, 4 naphthaquinone. Thestructure of this active dye ingredient was established by Tommasi [ 59] andCox [ 61].OOHO2-Hydroxy-1, 4-naphthaquinone (henna)This substance is the principal dyeing agent of the shrub henna, known asEgyptian privet. Henna has been used for dyeing hair and staining nails sinceancient times in Egypt [ 1]. This dye is found in the leaves of the plant and is
usually extracted with aqueous sodium bicarbonate. Henna produces yellow toreddish shades in proteins and is normally applied in acidic media. The nonionized(acid) form of henna is yellow while the ionized form is reddish-orange. Althoughthe more deeply colored form of henna is available at higher concentrations atalkaline pH, henna dyes hair better at acidic pH. Amro et al. [ 62] proposed thatprotonated groups on the hair ﬁber complex with lawsone anions. Therefore, acidicpH is optimal to create a higher concentration of protonated sites on the hair toattach to the ionized lawsone in solution. When the ionized form of lawsone isremoved from solution, additional lawsone ionizes to maintain equilibrium and thusto dye hair the reddish shade characteristic of henna dyed hair.The active coloring substance from camomile ﬂowers is a polyhydroxy ﬂavone,40,5,7-trihydroxy ﬂavone [ 2]. This substance is also found in parsley; and itscommon name is apiginin [ 63].O OHO OHOH
common name is apiginin [ 63].O OHO OHOH4',5,7-Trihydroxy flavone (camomile)Other polyhydroxy ﬂavones exist in plants [ 59]. These ﬂavones are usuallycombined as glucosides or rhamnosides and are generally yellow. These materialshave been used for dyeing cloth and hair. For dyeing cloth, these dyes are usually7.10 Other Dyes for Hair 473
mordanted with chromium, tin, or iron salts. This mordanting process changes thecolor as well as the binding character of the dye.These two dyestuffs, henna and camomile, are chemically related by the alpha-,beta-unsaturated grouping. This group is capable of undergoing 1,4 additionreactions with free amino or other nucleophilic groups of the side chain residuesof hair proteins. The review by Wall [ 2] describes vegetable dyes in greater detail,including their history, sources, active ingredients, and even dyeing conditions.7.10.5 Natural-Based Oxidative Hair ColoringNatural hair dyeing processes have been described in the literature based on 3,4dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) [ 10]. Natural pheomelanin type dyes begin with theoxidation of DOPA to dopaquinone which then reacts with cysteine, a nucleophileto ultimately form the natural red hair pigments. Brown et al. [ 10] found that by
beginning with the oxidation of DOPA and incorporating sulfur-containing nucleo-philes in the process, a wide range of shades can be produced on hair that areacceptable for hair dyeing. Oxidants such as atmospheric oxygen work, althoughthe combination of hydrogen peroxide and iodide ions appears to be more effective[64–66].An intense black eumelanin type pigment is produced by reacting DOPA withcontrolled amounts of potassium ferricyanide. 8-Hydroxy-1,4-dihydroben-zothiazine or thio substituted catechols which are simple analogs of intermediatesof the melanic pathways when oxidized with different at speciﬁc pH conditionsprovide different colors similar to those of permanent hair dyes [ 10]. Sometimeswhen these catechol or benzothiazine intermediates are oxidized in the presence ofoxidation dye nucleophiles they provide permanent hair dye colors. These systemsare still developmental and have not been commercialized, but do appear to offerpromise for the future.
promise for the future.7.10.6 Fiber Reactive DyesA ﬁber-reactive dye binds to the hair or wool through covalent bonds. Thesereactions generally involve either nucleophilic displacement by amino, guanidino,hydroxyl, or sulfhydryl groups of the keratin on a dyestuff containing either a labilehalogen or sulfate grouping. In addition, nucleophilic addition onto a dyestuffcontaining an activated oleﬁnic linkage can also be used for permanent binding.Fiber reactive dyes have not been used commercially for dyeing human hair.Nevertheless, these dyes offer a novel approach to permanent dyeing. A fewexamples of this type of dye are described in Table 7.13. Fiber-reactive dyeswill react with unreduced keratin. However, prior reduction provides additional474 7 Dyeing Human Hair
mercaptan groups for reaction with the dye and therefore enhances dyeing.For additional information, see the articles by Brown [ 13], Stead [ 55], and byShansky [ 67] and the references therein.7.11 Photoprotection of Hair by Hair DyesPande et al. [ 68] demonstrated that hair dyes (both oxidation and semi-permanent)grant a photoprotective effect to hair proteins providing a signiﬁcant decrease incortical damage as shown by tensile testing. This reduction in damage is greater thedarker the dyes used. The fact that this effect can be seen in the tensile propertiesproves that this photo-protection effect of hair dyes extends down into the corticalproteins.7.12 Hair Dyeing and Luster
proteins.7.12 Hair Dyeing and LusterHair shine is basically a ratio of specular to diffuse light scattering. Dark hairusually appears shinier than lighter hair. This is because part of the light is reﬂectedat the ﬁber surface, and part enters the ﬁber. The light entering the ﬁber is scatteredby reﬂecting off irregularities of the interior. When the light reemerges from theﬁber interior, the diffuse component is increased decreasing hair shine. If the ﬁber iscolored or dyed, some of this diffuse component is absorbed before reemerging,Table 7.13 Some examplesof ﬁber-reactive dyes used inwool dyeingNNNClClNHRNN ClClClNHRNNOH HNCHCH2SO2SO3Na SO3NaDichlorotriazine type Trichloroprimidine typeAn Activated Olefin Type7.12 Hair Dyeing and Luster 475
reducing it. In this manner hair that has been dyed makes the ﬁbers shinier [ 69]. Seethe section on hair luster or shine in Chap. 10for additional details on hair shine.Keis et al. [ 69] studied the effect of natural hair pigmentation on hair luster(shine) using a goniophotometer. This study conﬁrmed that increasing hair colorreduces light scattering and increases luster. These same scientists also examineddyed hair and found a similar but more complicated picture. Dye composition,concentration and penetration depth must be taken into consideration to account forthe results. In addition, the luster of hair of different colors is perceived differentlyby the human eye adding further complications. However, Lefaudeux et al. [ 70]described a method for hair luster based on polarization imaging that they suggest isconsistent for different hair colors.7.13 Safety Considerations for Hair DyesCorbett has reviewed the general toxicology of hair dyes [ 5,71]. Mutagenicity-
carcinogenicity of hair dyes has been reviewed by Kirkland [ 72]. Bergfeld [ 73],Ishihara [ 74], and Bourgeois-Spinasse [ 75] reported clinical observations ofadverse reactions with hair dyes. See also the section entitled, Regulation ofoxidation hair dye intermediates earlier in this chapter .This discussion consistsof a synopsis of these toxicological reviews and reports.As described earlier in the section on regulation of oxidation dyes, the Europeancommunity has been the most active region in the world with respect to thesafety and regulation of oxidation dye ingredients. COLIPA (Comite de LiaisonEuropeen de Industrie de la Parfumarie de Produits Cosmetiques et de Toilette) is avery active group in Europe that is dealing with the regulation and safety testing
requirements for permanent hair dye ingredients. Anyone concerned withmanufacturing and marketing hair dyes should be aware and keep aware of thewritings and conclusions of this group (see the discussion on COLIPA earlier in thischapter for details).The primary toxicological concerns of hair dyes, primarily oxidation hair dyes, arewith contact dermatitis and long-term “potential” systemic effects [ 5]. Of allhair products, the most sensitizing are the paradiamine oxidation dyes [ 75]. Further-more, the most sensitizing ingredients of these products are p-phenylenediamine,p-toluenediamine sulfate, and o-chloro-p-phenylenediamine, although other relatedaromatic amines have been shown to provide some sensitizing potential [ 74].Since p-phenylenediamine is the major component of oxidation hair dyes andoxidation dyes are the most widely used of all hair dyes, p-phenylenediamine is thesensitizer of prime concern. Corbett [ 5] pointed out that while p-phenylenediamine
is a strong allergin, the incidence of allergic reactions by oxidation dyes is of lowfrequency and the reaction when observed is generally mild. Corbett suggests thatthis low incidence of sensitization is due to the rapid reaction and decreasingconcentration of this reactive ingredient during actual hair dyeing [ 5].476 7 Dyeing Human Hair
The sensitization symptoms from oxidation dyes are a discrete dermatitis at theperiphery of the scalp and on the edges of the ears. Itching scalp, and occasionaleruptions occur on the face, especially around the eyelids [ 74]. Eruptions on thetrunk and limbs are rare [ 74].Usually symptoms appear several hours after the dyeing process has begun.Treatment of this allergic reaction consists of oxidation of residual paradiaminewith peroxide in saline solution. This treatment should be followed by applicationof corticoid creams or lotions [ 75]. Allergic reaction to hair color rinses is rare [ 67];however, a few incidents of allergic reaction to semipermanent hair dyes have beenreported [ 71].Misra et al. [ 76] provided data to suggest that the skin toxicity ofp-phenylenediamine might relate to its interaction with lipophilic biomoleculesand the subsequent biotransformation products. Gagliardi et al. [ 77] examined the
alleged claim that exposure to vapors of p-phenylenediamine in hair dressing salonsmight cause lung allergies. Their results and conclusions suggest that this is not thecase. They conclude that it is unreasonable to consider that hairdressers are at risk top-phenylenediamine-induced asthma.Long-term toxicological risk from semipermanent hair dyes is low [ 5,71].However, 2-nitro-p-phenylenediamine and 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine currentlyused in Europe in semipermanent hair dyes, but not in the U.S; have been testedextensively for potential carcinogenicity. This latter dye was shown to be non-carcinogenic in animal feeding studies. But, the former diamine caused adenomasin rats, but only at the highest feeding level. At moderate and low feeding levels,this dye did not produce adenomas [ 71].Several hair dye ingredients, primarily permanent hair dye components, havebeen tested for potential carcinogenicity [ 5,72]. The impetus for this testing
arose from the ﬁnding several years ago that some aromatic diamines provide apositive reaction as mutagens [ 5,71] in the Ames bacterial screening assay againstthe bacterium Salmonella typhimurium [ 76].Corbett summarized the details of the mutagenicity screening of oxidation dyecomponents. He concluded that the Ames test for aromatic diamines does notcorrelate as well with results of carcinogenicity in animal feeding studies, as forother chemical types [ 5]. Both Corbett [ 5] and Kirkland [ 72] summarized the resultsof several common hair dye ingredients in in-vitro mutation tests, in dominantlethal animal testing, and in epidemiological studies. One of these testing programsconsisted of a CTFA study involving more than 35 oxidation dye components and
34 textile dyes used in temporary hair color products. From this work and otherstudies, the FDA determined (in October l979) that all hair dye products containing2,4-diamino anisole must bear a cancer-warning label [ 77–79]. Industry respondedby removing this ingredient from oxidation hair dyes.Corbett concluded that “all animal studies completed to date have shown hairdyes to be safe for their intended use.” Kirkland [ 72] concluded that “epidemiologi-cal and human monitoring studies have not detected any such risk (carcinogenicity)in exposed human populations.” However, Kirkland suggested that more controlledepidemiological studies and more extensive monitoring of exposed populations arein order.7.13 Safety Considerations for Hair Dyes 477
7.14 Gray Hair and Graying of Human HairGray hair is described in this Chapter on hair dyeing because the gray hair audienceis one of the largest groups that dye their hair. It is unfortunate that so little is knownabout the physical and chemical properties and distinctions between gray hair andhighly pigmented hair ﬁbers. For a discussion on the current status of this subjectsee the section entitled, Hair Pigment Structure and Chemical Oxidation ,i nChap. 5.Nevertheless, data on the incidence of graying versus age and some of thebackground and speculation on possible causes of graying in this Chapter shouldbe useful to those involved in research and development of hair dyes. This section
begins with a discussion on the formation of gray hair followed by the incidence ofgray hair by sex, age, and geo-racial group. Next, the relationship between gray hairand other important hair parameters such as diameter and hair density is presented.Finally, the reactivity of gray hair and the phenomenon of sudden graying aredescribed.7.14.1 The Process of Graying of Scalp HairGray hair relates to the size and distribution of the melanin granules as well as thetypes of pigments in the ﬁbers; see Chap. 5for additional details on hair pigments.The medulla does seem to play some role in gray hair, as suggested by Nagase et al.[80] by scattering light through a change in refractive index at the air to hair
interface of medullary “pores”. This effect is analogous to the phenomenon thatoccurs in the genetic abnormality of pili annulati also known as ringed hair thatprovides the appearance of bands or rings of silver or gray and dark regions alongthe ﬁber axis, see Chap. 1for additional details.Gray hair is dependent on the production of less pigment in the individual hairswith advancing age. It is usually associated with middle age; however, graying canbegin in one’s early 20’s as described later in this chapter. Graying generally beginsin the temple region and then spreads to the vertex or crown and ﬁnally to theremainder of the scalp usually affecting the occipital region (back of the skull) last.The formation of hair pigments takes place in the melanocytes (pigment producingcells) in the bulb of the follicle starting with the amino acid tyrosine as described inChap. 5. The melanin type pigments are incorporated into the hair ﬁber as large
granules in the zone of keratinization, see Chap. 1.Biochemical control of the graying process is still not completely understood;however, Kukita [ 81] suggested that gray hair is produced by a gradual decrease inthe function of melanin producing cells. Tobin and Paus [ 82] suggested thatmelanocytes in the region of the hair bulb function through 7–15 different haircycles to produce pigmented hairs for up to four decades or longer. Each group ofmelanocytes in each follicle functions independently of melanocytes in neighboring478 7 Dyeing Human Hair
hairs. Graying results from a decrease and the eventual termination of the activity ofthe enzyme tyrosinase in the lower bulb [ 81,82]. This enzyme is involved in thereaction scheme called Raper’s scheme for the formation of 5, 6-dihydroxypheny-lalanine and then its quinone from the amino acid tyrosine. These species then reactfurther to produce the melanin pigments.Kukita [ 81] demonstrated that the onset of tyrosinase activity coincides withthe appearance of melanocytes during anagen. Its activity increases rapidly withincreasing numbers of melanocytes. Tobin et al. [ 83] summarized the regulation ofcoat color in hairy mammals by POMC-derived peptides ( a-melanocyte stimulatinghormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone and b-Endorphin). The expression of these
peptides and the melanocyte-1 receptor (MC-1R) are conﬁned to speciﬁc regions ofthe hair follicle and are adjusted or controlled in their effectiveness during the hairgrowth cycle. b-Endorphin has also been shown by Tobin et al. [ 83]to play a role inthe regulation of human hair pigmentation.Commo et al. [ 84] studying hair follicles of pigmented hair, gray hair and whitehair determined that the loss of hair shaft melanin is associated with a decrease inboth hair bulb melanin content and hair bulb melanocytes population density. Arcket al. [ 85] suggested a free radical theory of graying involving high oxidative stress
and apoptosis in the graying process. This hypothesis suggests that radiation,inﬂammation and psycho-emotional stresses are involved in graying. Therefore,increases in any of these stresses will speed up the graying process. On the otherhand, any reduction in these stresses should lead to delaying the graying process.This hypothesis seems to ﬁt the suggestion by Tobin and Paus [ 82] that the initiationof graying begins about 5 years later for Asians and even later for Africanscompared with Caucasians, because darker pigmentation in skin and hairsurrounding the hair bulb should provide some protection against sunlight radiationeffects or stress.Tobin and Paus [ 82] suggested that the active melanocytes in the hair bulb arereplaced with “seedlings” seven to ﬁfteen times in a human lifetime. Therefore, a7.14 Gray Hair and Graying of Human Hair 479
small number of melanocytes in the hair bulb function for up to 10 years at anexceptionally high melanogenic activity. This intense oxidative activity generateslarge amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). If these ROS are not activelyremoved over time, then DNA (nuclear and mitochondrial) damage results produc-ing mutations that induce de-pigmentation or graying.7.14.2 The Onset and Incidence of GrayingTobin and Paus [ 82] predicted that the average age of the onset of gray hair forCaucasians is in the mid-30s, while for Asians it is in the late 30s and for those ofAfrican descent it occurs in the mid-40s. These scientists are talking about the ageof the onset of complete graying rather than the age of onset of a few gray hairswhich occurs earlier than these speciﬁed ages.Keogh and Walsh [ 86] conducted a large study on the incidence of graying in
1965 in Australia. This study included subjects from ages 25 to 60 plus. Thesescientists found no signiﬁcant difference in the graying of hair of males versusfemales, so they combined the male and female data and separated the data into5 year age increments. This study contained a total of 8,720 persons including 6,653men and 2,067 women. This paper did not specify racial characteristics of thegroup. However, the data is from Victoria, Australia, therefore it likely consistslargely or totally of Caucasians.Keogh and Walsh included persons who had dyed their hair and those who hadnot dyed it. When the hair had been dyed or suspected of being dyed they relied onthe subject’s own statement regarding the true color and degree of grayness prior todyeing because preliminary trials showed the observers to be in substantial agree-ment with ratings by trained observers.7.14.3 The Effect of Hair Color on the Perception of Graying
The data of Table 7.14 summarizes the data of Keogh and Walsh [ 86] comparing %any gray and % complete gray versus the “true color of the hair” categorized asFair, Medium and Dark. Signiﬁcant differences were observed in the ability to seegraying of these three hair color types.For the data of Table 7.14, the numbers of subjects are all relatively largeespecially in the three lowest age groups. Each of these groups contains morethan 300 subjects. The data of age groups 42.5 through 52.5 are all 205 subjectsor larger and for age group 57.2, the number of subjects is 137 or greater. But, in agegroup 62.5 the number of subjects in each hair color group is only 26 or fewer.Therefore, the data of this oldest age group are the least reliable.These authors [ 86] analyzed the data by logistic regression and concluded that atapproximately age 49 (48.6%) about 50% of this population has 50% gray hair. This480 7 Dyeing Human Hair
statement has been widely quoted and mis-quoted to apply to all populations. Itwould appear that the age of 49 for 50% gray hair should apply to Caucasianpopulations. If the conclusion of Tobin and Paus [ 82] is correct about graying inother geo-racial groups, one would expect it to be about 5 years later for Asians and10 years later for those of African descent.Chi Square analysis shows signiﬁcant differences between fair and medium todark haired groups. In contrast to little graying, this perception of complete grayingappears earlier in the fair haired group than in the other two hair color groupsespecially after age 40. This effect likely arises because a few dark hairs will standout more readily against a light background of gray hair than a few light hairsagainst a light gray background.7.14.4 The Age that Graying BeginsTo test at what ages the detection of graying begins, the Keogh and Walsh [ 86] data
for the three classes of hair color were examined because these data started atage 25. Plots were made of the mid-point age of each age group versus the % anygray, providing the % any gray data of Table 7.14. The graphical data were clearlynot linear, but displayed a distinct curvature. JMP statistical software from SAS wasused to provide the best ﬁtting polynomial models for all three hair color types (fair,Table 7.14 Age and graying of Caucasian scalp hair; calculated by means polynomial modelingfrom data by Keogh and Walsh [ 86]% Any detectable gray % Total or completely grayAge Fair Medium Dark Age Fair Medium Dark27.5 3.4 9.4 27.7 27.5 0.4 0 0.032.5 19.4 34.0 47.4 32.5 0.6 0 0.537.5 39.2 54.1 63.9 37.5 0.9 2.2 0.5442.5 60.1 70.0 77.3 42.5 4.6 3.3 2.647.5 79.1 82.1 87.2 47.5 8.9 7.0 7.452.5 93.6 90.7 94.1 52.5 23.9 17.4 13.857.5 100 96.1 97.7 57.5 42.3 30.1 18.662.5 97.8 98.6 98.2 62.5 50.0 23.3 16.8

medium and dark). Graphs were constructed from the prediction data of the bestequations with the smoothest-least interrupted curves in the lower age groups andpredictions made to as low an age as feasible.From this analysis, the detection of any gray hair for the dark haired personsbegins at about age 21–22, for the medium color hair persons it begins at about age25 and for the fair haired persons the detection of graying begins at about age 26.deBerker et al. [ 87] have described where graying occurs at earlier ages thansuggested by these data. This, “premature graying” has been deﬁned as the “onsetof graying before 20 years of age” [ 87] in Caucasians, before 30 years of age inpeople of African descent [ 82,87] and before 25 years of age in Asians [ 82,87].This deﬁnition agrees well with the conclusions from the statistical equationsto predict the beginning of graying in Caucasians. The conditions of premature
graying are generally related to diseases [ 87] such as pernicious anaemia, hyper-thyroidism and certain autoimmune diseases or even premature cardiovasculardisease as shown by Eisenstein and Edelstein [ 88].7.14.5 A Second Large Study of Graying of HairAnother large data pool of graying versus age is from the Copenhagen city heartstudy by Schnohr et al. [ 89]. The authors of this study do not specify racialcharacteristics of the subjects. Because of the location I assume that the subjectsare largely or totally Caucasians. One advantage to the Copenhagen study is thatit contained such large numbers (5,837 men and 7,163 women (13,000 totalsubjects)). The disadvantages of this study are that the age groups were in10 year increments and it did not include any subjects younger than 30 years ofage. In addition, the authors separated out those subjects who dyed their hair and didnot determine grayness on those subjects. The Copenhagen study separated all
subjects into those with no gray hair, those with little gray hair, moderate gray hairand total gray/white hair and also those with dyed hair and those with wigs.To determine if the data from these two large studies could be combined,I assumed that the percentage of gray haired subjects in the dyed hair group wasthe same as in the non-dyed group and added the two together. With this assumptionand combining the data of men and women, the data of % any gray and % total orcomplete gray corresponded well with the data of Keogh and Walsh [ 86], that is thedifferences were generally within plus or minus 2%.7.14.6 Best Estimates of % Little Gray, % Moderate Gray and %Completely or Total Gray in 5 Year Age IncrementsData from all three hair color types of the Keogh and Walsh [ 86] study werecombined with the data of men and women in the Copenhagen study. The Keogh482 7 Dyeing Human Hair
and Walsh study went down to age 25 while the Copenhagen study [ 87] only to age35 (30–39). The Keogh and Walsh study used few subjects at age 55 and above;whereas the Copenhagen study used many more subjects in the higher age groups.So, where possible, the Keogh and Walsh data were used for ages 20–30 and theCopenhagen study was used for ages 60–70. Means of the combined studies wereused for ages 35–55. The data of Table 7.15 summarizes the analyses of thesecombined studies on the incidence of graying with additional explanations as part ofthat table.No comparable data on graying of hair versus age based on large numbers ofAsians or Africans could be found in the literature. Therefore, assuming that theseconclusions of Tobin and Paus [ 82] are correct: that graying begins with Asians andAfricans about 5 years and 10 years later than with Caucasians and that once
graying begins the rate of graying is the same for these three geo-racial groups,then one can approximate the incidence of graying versus age for Asians andAfricans by examining the data of n–14 and 7–15 and moving each data pointback 5 years for Asians and 10 years (to older ages) for Africans. Until sufﬁcientdata can be obtained for large numbers of Asians and those of African descent theseapproximations should be useful.Table 7.15 Percent little gray, percent moderate gray and percent total gray of the scalp hair ofCaucasians at different ages; calculated by polynomial modeling from data by Keogh and Walsh[86] and Schnohr et al.

7.14.7 Hair Graying and Hair Fiber DiameterThere is conﬂicting evidence in the literature as to whether gray hairs are coarser orﬁner than highly pigmented hairs. Nevertheless, current evidence appears to favorthat gray-white hairs are coarser than highly pigmented hairs, but the evidence isnot overwhelming. This subject is covered in detail in Chap. 5in the sectionentitled, Hair Pigment Structure and Chemical Oxidation. For leading referencesinto this area see the papers by Hollfelder et al. [ 90], Gao and Bedell [ 91] and VanNeste [ 92] which are summarized in that section in Chap. 5.7.14.8 Hair Graying and Scalp Hair Density Versus AgeThis is area with a major GAP and requires investigation. My conclusion is that not
considering diseases like alopecia areata (described later), hair density in gray areasshould differ very little from those in areas with highly pigmented hairs on the samescalp. Consider that Graying begins in the temple region in the early 20s (asmentioned above) and yet the temple region is one of the last scalp regions to beaffected by male pattern alopecia (MPA). Graying does not appear to be affected byfemale pattern alopecia (FPA). Therefore, MPA and FPA appear independent ofgraying therefore I would conclude that there is little difference in scalp hair densityof gray and pigmented hair. I offer the caution that this is a conclusion, not a fact,and needs to be either conﬁrmed or denied by additional research.7.14.9 Sensitivity of Gray Hair to Light Radiation and FreeRadical ReactionsLess pigmented hairs, e.g., gray hairs, blonde hair or bleached hairs are also moresensitive to light radiation than heavily pigmented hairs [ 48,91]. Therefore, lightly
pigmented gray hairs when exposed to ultraviolet radiation for a sufﬁcient periodwill show lower levels of cystine and correspondingly higher levels of cysteic acidparticularly in their outer layers as compared to heavily pigmented hairs. In additionultraviolet or free radical damage to tryptophan, as shown by McMillen andJachowicz [ 93], and other amino acids occurs at a faster rate in lightly pigmentedgray hairs versus heavily pigmented hair. Pande et al. [ 68] showed that dyed hairwhen exposed to ultraviolet light provides higher tensile properties than non-dyedhair. This experiment demonstrates that hair pigments provide photochemicalprotection to hair. Therefore gray hairs will show greater damage to sunlight andultraviolet light compared with more highly pigmented hairs (see Chaps. 5,9and10for additional information).484 7 Dyeing Human Hair
7.14.10 Sudden Graying–Whitening of HairJelinek [ 94] reviewed several historical and literary reports of sudden graying ofhair. The one that this author has heard most frequently is that of Sir Thomas More,whose hair was reported to have turned white the night before his execution. A notein the British Medical Journal [ 95] on the subject of “sudden whitening of hair”relates this condition to alopecia areata. Sabouraud [ 96] reported that white hairsare often retained in patches of alopecia areata. This report [ 96] attributes suddenwhitening to a disease process related to alopecia areatea. Sudden graying-whitening involves the entire scalp, wherein the dark hairs are shed over a shorttime period, but most of the white or gray hairs are retained providing the appear-ance of sudden graying.References1.

Chapter 8Polymers in Hair ProductsAbstract Polymers have become increasingly important components of cosmeticsover the past few decades. The original uses of polymers in hair care were asﬁxative agents and viscosity controlling additives; however, new polymers todayare also used for hair conditioning and for the development of new style controlproducts. Polymer substantivity to hair ﬁbers increases with molecular size, with anincreasing number of polar group attachments and especially with an increasingnumber of cationic groups for attachment to the negatively charged surface of hair
ﬁbers. From an anionic shampoo medium the cationic charge on polymers isneutralized and the adsorbing species is essentially a neutral or negatively chargedspecies. The most successful silicone conditioning polymers for hair care have beenused in both shampoo and conditioner compositions. Dimethicones in shampooscondition undamaged or lightly damaged hair better than they condition highlydamaged, bleached hair or even tip ends because neutral hydrophobic conditioningagents adsorb more readily to an undamaged hydrophobic surface than to a dam-aged highly polar hair surface. New block co-polymers and a fairly large number ofnew cationic polymers have been introduced into hair care recently, while fractalpolymers (highly irregular shapes) and nanoparticles have been developed and arereceiving attention for potential use in hair care.8.1 Introduction
8.1 IntroductionSeveral new, useful ﬁxative polymers have been introduced into the cosmeticindustry over the past decade to provide improved hair spray formulations inresponse to the 55% VOC regulation for hair sprays and hair shines that wereoriginally imposed by the California Air Resources Board. In addition, new cationicco-polymers have become available that employ three and sometimes four co-monomers. Long chain alkyl groups have been introduced into several of theseC.R.

and into some other cationic polymers to provide hydrophobicity. Further trends inhair care polymers are summarized in a paper by Lockhead [ 1].Over the past two decades, the use of silicone polymers in two in one shampooshas become increasingly important commercially. Several different types of sili-cone polymers have been introduced into the cosmetic industry in the past decadeand our knowledge on the adsorption, conditioning and stabilization of siliconesfrom anionic shampoo systems has increased greatly. As a result, a sectionsummarizing the literature on silicone polymers including their interactions withhair and with other ingredients especially in shampoo systems is included in thischapter.New block co-polymers and a fairly large number of new cationic polymers havebeen introduced into hair care this past decade. Fractal polymers or dendrimers
(with irregular shapes and surfaces) are receiving attention for potential use in haircare formulations and the area of nanogels and the generation and use ofnanoparticles in hair cosmetics is also an area that is beginning to receive attentionand is described in this chapter. These areas (fractal polymers and nanoparticles)should prove to be fruitful in the future. However, at this time these innovations arein their infancy for our industry. The above subjects provide the basis for most ofthe new material in this section on polymers and polymer chemistry in hairproducts.Polymers have become increasingly important components of cosmetics overthe past few decades. Their more important uses are as primary ingredients oradjuncts in shampoos, conditioning products, styling products (lotions and gels),mousses, and hair sprays. They have been used to condition hair [ 2,3] and toimprove the substantivity of other ingredients to hair [ 4,5], to improve combing [ 2],
manageability [ 2,3], body [ 6], and curl retention [ 1,3,7]; to thicken formulations[8,9]; and to improve emulsion stability [ 8].Because of environmental concerns, a great deal of research has taken place todevelop polymers that release water more readily. As suggested earlier, the goal isto provide polymers that are more compatible with water with the aim of develop-ing spray products that can be formulated with lower levels of volatile organiccompounds (VOC) and as a consequence more water. The driving force at this timehas become the standards proposed by the California Air Resources Board (CARB)that has proposed that the maximum allowable VOC emissions for hairsprays be:• 80% by January 1, 1993 and• 55% ﬁrst proposed for January 1, 1998 and later extended to June 1, 1999.Since a few other states have adopted the 55% VOC standard for hair sprays and
shines, creative formulation and science is necessary to market these products.VOC’s in hairsprays in the U.S. have become an issue while hydrocarbon pro-pellants with ethanol solvent are commonly used in some other parts of the world.Thus, the section on hair sprays has been expanded to summarize issues andconcerns created by this regulation and to describe how these are being addressed.Other CARB regulations relevant to hair care are:490 8 Polymers in Hair Products
Hair mousses, 6% VOC – by December 31, 2002 and Hair styling gels, 6% VOC –by January 1, 1994. These regulations specify a 1-year period after the effectivedates above for any company to sell existing products that do not comply with theseregulations in the San Francisco Bay Area Air Quality Management District.Hairsprays are an exception. Hairsprays that are not in compliance must be offthe shelves by the effective dates.The following subjects are of special relevance to the application of polymers inhair products and thus are the focus of this chapter:• The binding interactions of polymers to hair;• The chemical nature of polymers used in hair products;• In situ polymerization reaction mechanisms;• Rheological or ﬂow properties of polymer solutions; and• Film formation and adhesional properties of polymers.The major emphasis in this chapter is on the ﬁrst three of these subjects – the
chemical and/or binding interactions of polymers to hair; the chemical nature ofhair sprays, setting products, and mousses; and in situ polymerization reactions inhair. Although the rheological properties of polymer solutions are especiallyimportant to formula viscosity, and to the sensory perceptions of cosmetics, theywill not be emphasized here. It sufﬁces to say that cellulosic ethers [ 8,9] areprobably the most important thickening agents in hair products, and ethoxylatedesters and carboxy vinyl polymers are also important.For hair sprays, polymer setting products, and polymeric conditioners, ﬁlmproperties as well as the ability of the polymer solution to spread over the ﬁbersurface is important to product performance. The ability of the polymer to spreadover the hair surface is governed by its solution viscosity and the wettability of theﬁber surface in contact with the polymer solution. For optimum spreading, low
solution viscosity is important, and both polar and dispersion interactions have beenshown to be important to the ease of spreading over hair ﬁber surfaces [ 10]. Thesurface of cosmetically unaltered hair is generally considered to be hydrophobic,whereas the cortex is more hydrophilic. Kamath et al. [ 10] have shown that bothbleaching and reduction of hair increase the wettability of hair, making its surfacemore hydrophilic. For a more thorough treatment of wettability and the spreading ofliquids on solids, see the following references [ 10–13].8.2 The Binding of Preformed Polymers to HairChapter 6describes the work of Steinhardt and Harris and the afﬁnities of organicacids [ 14] and quaternary ammonium hydroxide compounds [ 15] to keratin ﬁbers.
It illustrates the importance of increasing molecular size and even non-primarybonds to the substantivity of ingredients to hair. In the case of polymeric ingre-dients, these same principles are operative, and even more important. Chapter 6also describes the important interactions leading to deposition of conditioning8.2 The Binding of Preformed Polymers to Hair 491
ingredients from both anionic and cationic surfactant solutions, including an hypoth-esis that considers a continuum between a charge driven adsorption process and ahydrophobically driven process. This same hypothesis is not repeated in the currentdiscussion; however, it is highly relevant to the discussion which focuses on factorsthat are important to the deposition of polymeric ingredients onto human hair.8.2.1 Chemical Bonding and SubstantivityIt is convenient to consider three extreme types of bonds between polymer and hair.• Primary valence bonds (ionic and covalent bonds).• Polar interactions (primarily hydrogen bonds).• Dispersion forces (Van der Waals attractive forces).It should be noted that bond classiﬁcations of this type are not rigorous, and thetransition from one type to another is sometimes gradual. Therefore, intermediatebond types do exist [ 16], although for simplicity in the following discussion arigorous classiﬁcation of bond type is presented.
rigorous classiﬁcation of bond type is presented.Primary valence bonds include ionic and covalent bonds and are the strongestbinding forces. Both of these types of bonds generally provide bond energies ofabout 50–200 kcal/mol [ 17]. Ionic bonds are extremely important to the interactionsof polymeric cationic ingredients and hair, whereas covalent bonds are probablyinvolved between polymer and hair in certain in-situ polymerization reactionsdescribed later in this chapter.Hydrogen bonds are the most important polar interactions and are the nextstrongest binding forces, with bond energies generally of the order of 4–10 kcal/mol [ 17]. These bonds are about an order of magnitude less than covalent or ionicbonds and are important to the binding of polymers containing polyalcohol orpolyamide units to hair. Polypeptides and proteins are two examples where hydro-gen bonding is important.Dispersion forces or Van der Waals attractions provide bond energies generally
of the order of 1 kcal/mol [ 18] about two orders of magnitude less than covalent orionic bonds. Van der Waals attractive forces are relatively weak and are dipolar innature. Since electrons are in constant motion, at any instant in time, the electrondistribution is probably distorted, creating a small dipole. This momentary dipolecan affect the electron distribution in an adjacent molecule. If contact is just right,attraction is induced [ 19]. These attractive forces are short-range and act onlybetween the surfaces of molecules. Therefore, the total strength of Van der Waalsbonding increases with molecular surface area, as an approximation with increasingmolecular size. Therefore, in polymers van der Waals bonding can approach thestrength of primary valence bonds.For an interaction between molecules, entropy is inversely related to the amount of
structural organization of the total system. More randomness or less structural organi-zation of the system is always preferred. In many cases, less structural organization is492 8 Polymers in Hair Products
required to bind a large hydrophobic molecule to a hair surface than to emulsify it intoa lipid-aqueous system. Thus, entropy can provide a driving force to push largehydrophobic polymers out of the solvent system and onto the hair ﬁber surface.8.2.2 Molecular Size and SubstantivityMark [ 20,21] described the forces involved in multiple polar and dispersionbinding in polymers by means of molar cohesions (see Table 8.1). These datashow that in polymers of relatively low molecular weight, 10,000 Da, the cohesiveTable 8.1 Polar and dispersion forces in polymersPolymer Structural unit Approximate molar cohesionsfor units shown (kcal/mol)Polyethylene(-CH2-CH2-)1.0Polyisopropylene(-CH2CH-CH2CH-)CH3CH31.2Polystyrene(-CH2CH-CH2CH-)C6H5C6H54.0Polyvinyl alcohol(-CH2CH-CH2CH-)OH OH4.8Polyamides(-CH2CH-CH2CH-)C=ONH2NH2C=O5.8aMolar cohesions listed are actually for a chain length of 5 A ˚. The structural units shown above are
approximately 4.6 A ˚long, assuming a constant carbon-carbon bond length of 1.54 A ˚[22]8.2 The Binding of Preformed Polymers to Hair 493
energy approaches that of primary chemical bonds. Therefore, by analogy with theafﬁnity of surfactants and dyes to hair (Chap. 6), one may predict the importance ofmolecular size to the substantivity of polymers to hair.Obviously, multiple sites for attachment of even stronger bonds such as polarand especially primary valence bonds are even more important to substantivity.Multiple covalent attachment sites could conceivably occur via in situ polymeriza-tion reactions and with bi-functional cross-linking agents (see Chap. 4). Howeverfor pragmatic reasons, this is not nearly as important as multiple ionic attachmentsto hair as can occur with cationic polymers.The appropriate spacing of groups in the polymer so that maximum bonding canoccur, especially to ionic and polar groups on the keratin structure, is also importantto substantively. As a ﬁrst approximation, the maximum frequency of primarybonds and the maximum molecular size will provide maximum substantivity.
8.2.3 Isoelectric Point of Hair and Polymer SubstantivityAlthough polymers may penetrate to a limited extent into human hair [ 23], the keyinteractions between hair and most polymers occur at or near the ﬁber surface.Obviously, lower molecular weight polymers are more prone to penetrate than highmolecular weight polymers and damaged hair is more penetrable than chemicallyunaltered hair.Since ionic bonds are the most important primary valence bonds for binding tohair, under low temperature conditions in an aqueous or aqueous alcohol system,the net charge at the ﬁber surface is critical to polymer hair interactions. Wilkersonhas shown that unaltered human hair has an isoelectric point near pH 3.67 [ 24].
Therefore the surface of hair bears a net negative charge at all pH values above itsisoelectric point. Since most cosmetic hair treatments are formulated above this pH,cationics ingredients are attracted to hair more readily than anionics, andpolycationics are more substantive to hair than polyanionics.8.2.4 Desorption and Breaking Multiple BondsFaucher et al. [ 25] demonstrated that desorption of a polymeric cationic cellulose(polymer JR) (see Table 8.2) from hair is slower than would be expected from asimple diffusional release predicted by the square root of time law [ 26]. Thesescientists suggested that desorption of a polymer occurs only after all sites ofattachment are broken. Statistically, the process of breaking all attachments simul-taneously is of low probability. Therefore, one would expect high substantivity anda slow rate of release with increasing molecular size and increasing primary valencebonding sites.494 8 Polymers in Hair Products
8.3 Penetration of Polymers into HairLow-molecular-we ight polypeptides [ 27]( M n¼1,000) and polyethyleneimine(Mn¼600) [ 28] have been shown to diffuse into hair. Somewhat largerpolypeptides (M n¼10,000) [ 27] and polymer JR, with an average molecularweight of 250,000 [ 23], have also been reported to penetrate into hair. Thepolymer JR study involved bleached hair. These data suggest that penetration islimited to about 10% of the hair after 7 day s and about an order of magnitude lessin unaltered hair [ 25]. Sorption of a higher-molecular-weight JR polymer (aver-age molecular weight of 600,000) by bl eached hair is similar to the smallerpolymer by unaltered hair.It appears that some limited penetration into human hair can occur by the lower-molecular-weight species of low molecular weight polymers (less than 10,000 Da).Table 8.2 Approximate structures for three cationic polymers used in hair care productsH-CH 2-CH 2-N +  X _H

Larger polymers, up to 500,000 Da, may even contain species (smaller) that candiffuse into the cuticle and perhaps further. Intercellular diffusion or diffusionthrough the non-keratin regions is probably the preferred route for these largemolecules (see Chap. 6). If the hair is degraded sufﬁciently or if the degree ofpolymerization for the polymer provides a broad distribution, intracellular diffusionmay also occur. However, it is highly unlikely that large polymers penetrate to asigniﬁcant extent into human hair. Neutral or anionic polymers have not beenstudied for penetration effects. However, as a ﬁrst approximation, one mightdraw similar conclusions with regard to the size and extent of penetration ofthese polymers also.8.4 Cationic Polymers and Their Interactions with Hair
Because of their high degree of substantivity, cationic polymers are one of the moreimportant types of polymers used in hair products. They are even useful inshampoos in addition to their use in hair conditioners. Their major asset, highsubstantivity, is also a potential problem, because they can be so substantive thatthey are sometimes difﬁcult to remove from hair by shampooing.Cationic ingredients in general are highly substantive to hair because of hair’slow isoelectric point (IP). The IP of cosmetically unaltered hair is approximatelypH 3.67 [ 24] and even lower in bleached hair. Thus, at any pH above the isoelectric,the surface of hair bears a net negative charge; therefore positively charged(cationic) ingredients are attracted to it.Even monofunctional cationics are substantive to hair to the extent that they
resist removal by water rinsing. For example, stearyl benzyl dimethyl ammoniumchloride and distearyl dimonium chloride are major active ingredients in cremerinse products because they are substantive to water rinsing and condition the hairﬁber surface.Dye staining tests [ 29,30] shows that substantivity of monofunctional cationicsto water rinsing does not occur unless the hydrocarbon portion is approximately8–10 carbon atoms or longer. This effect occurs because sufﬁcient Van der Waalsattractive forces in addition to the electrostatic bond must exist to bind the moleculeto the ﬁber in the presence of the aqueous phase. As the molecular size of thecationic structure is increased, even greater sorption and substantivity result [ 30].This enhanced substantivity is partly due to an increase in dispersion bonding andpartly due entropy, that is due to the fact that the structure becomes less hydrophilicand partitions more readily from the aqueous phase to the keratin phase which
requires less structural organization.In many shampoos it has become practice to use cationic surfactants or polymersin an anionic shampoo system. The use of a small amount of a cationic ingredient inthe presence of a large excess of anionic surfactant results in charge neutralizationby the anionic surfactant forming a cationic–anionic complex which is emulsiﬁedby the anionic surfactant. These interactions are described in more detail in the next496 8 Polymers in Hair Products
section for Polyquaternium-10. In effect the cationic (monofunctional or polymer)is converted into a tightly bound neutral salt species (cationic–anionic complex)which is essentially a neutral hydrophobic ingredient. Therefore, in an anionicshampoo system which always has an excess of anionic surfactant, substantivityto hair depends on hydrophobic interactions and entropy rather than a charge–chargeinteraction. This interaction is entirely different from a cationic conditioner system.These different interactions are described in more detail in the next section underthe title of Cationic Polymer–Surfactant Complexes. Approximate structuralformulas for three cationic polymers that have been used in hair care applicationsare described in Table 8.2.8.4.1 Interactions of Quaternized Cellulosic Polymerswith Hair8.4.1.1 Polymer JR (Polyquaternium-10 Formerly Quaternium-19)Polymer JR has been used in many different commercial hair products as a
conditioning ingredient, including several different conditioning shampoos. Poly-mer JR has a relatively low charge density 670 [ 31], and a high density of polargroups (hydroxyl), see Table 8.2. Charge density is the residue molecular weightper unit of positive charge. This type of polymer has been studied in three differentmolecular weight versions – 250,000, 400,000, and 600,000 – in several excellentpublications by Faucher, Goddard, and Hannah [ 23,25,31–33].The chemical structure for polymer JR in Table 8.2approximates the structure ofthis polymer and is based on information in the CTFA cosmetic ingredient dictio-nary [ 34] and the charge density value of approximately 670 [ 33]. Note that thepositions and numbers of ethoxamer units may vary for this structure, as does theposition of the hydroxypropyl quaternary grouping. Polymer JR has been used inseveral different commercial hair products as a conditioning ingredient, includingseveral different conditioning shampoos.
8.4.1.2 Adsorption and Absorption to HairFaucher and Goddard [ 23] studied the uptake of polymer JR onto bleached andunaltered hair. Their data suggest limited penetration into bleached hair andpossibly some penetration into unaltered hair, too, for the lower-molecular-weightportions. At 0.1% polymer concentration, approximately 35 mg polymer per gramhair was sorbed onto bleached hair after 8 days.After 1 h, 8 mg polymer per gram hair was sorbed (polymer molecular weight:250,000). A rule of thumb for the uptake of a cationic surfactant (cetyl trimethylammonium chloride) onto unaltered hair after 2–5 min reaction time is 1–3 mg8.4 Cationic Polymers and Their Interactions with Hair 497
cationic bound per gram of hair. Bleached hair will bind about double that amount,e.g., 4–8 mg per gram (depending on the amount of bleaching). These amounts areessentially surface sorption with limited penetration into the hair.8.4.1.3 Effect of Molecular WeightThree different molecular weight versions of Polymer JR (250,000, 400,000, and600,000) were studied with respect to sorption onto bleached hair [ 23]. The lowest-molecular-weight species was sorbed fastest and to the greatest extent. The sorptioncurve for the highest-molecular-weight species shows a rapid uptake followed byleveling, indicating saturation of the hair ﬁber surface and limited penetration.8.4.1.4 Effect of ChargePolymer JR uptake was compared to an analogous uncharged hydroxyethyl cellu-lose polymer. The uptake of the charged polymer was 50 times that of theuncharged polymer [ 23].8.4.1.5 Effect of ConcentrationThe uptake of polymer JR increased sixfold with concentration, from 0.01% to
1.0% [ 23]. However, apparent diffusion coefﬁcients from initial slopes indicate aslower diffusion rate with increasing concentration. Faucher and Goddard [ 23]explain this anomaly by suggesting that a more compact polymer deposits on thehair at the higher concentrations. This may be somewhat analogous to the effects ofpH on the activation energy for diffusion of orange II dye into keratin ﬁbers [ 35]. Inthis latter situation, the activation energy for diffusion of dye into the ﬁbersincreases with decreasing pH where a higher concentration of dye enters the ﬁbers.Apparently, the steeper concentration gradient with decreasing pH increases theenergy required for each dye molecule to enter the ﬁbers.8.4.1.6 Effect of pHThe inﬂuence of pH on polymer JR sorption was studied in un-buffered media [ 23],
starting at pH 4, 7, and 10. The largest uptake was at pH 7, with about 15% lesspolymer sorbed at pH 4 (which can be attributed to a decreasing net negative chargeon the ﬁber surface). However, there is about 30% less polymer pickup at pH 10than at pH 7, which would not be predicted on the basis of electrostatics or swellingof the hair. Drifting pH caused complications, and the observed differences,although small, await a satisfactory explanation, see Effects of Salt .498 8 Polymers in Hair Products
8.4.1.7 Effects of SaltAdded salt produces a larger effect on the uptake of polymer JR than pH [ 25]. Thissalt effect may in fact help to explain the pH effect. The addition of 0.1% sodiumchloride decreased pickup by almost two-thirds. This may be attributed to shieldingof sorption sites on the hair or competitive inhibition. Although the afﬁnity ofsodium ion for hair should be much less than for polymer JR, at this concentrationsodium ion has more than 20 times the cationic charge concentration relative topolymer JR.Other salts, such as lanthanum and calcium, had an even greater effect indecreasing polymer pickup. Trivalent ions (lanthanum, aluminum, and iron) hadthe largest effect, followed by divalent ions (calcium and ferrous iron). Monovalentions showed the least effect. Faucher et al. [ 25] suggested the analogy to hair of astrong acid ion exchange resin and postulated that the decrease in polymer uptakeby inorganic cations is due to competitive inhibition.
8.4.1.8 Effect of Hair DamageMost of the studies with polymer JR employed bleached hair. Bleached hair has ahigher concentration of negative sites at and near the ﬁber surface to attract andbind cations. Bleached hair is also more porous than chemically unaltered hair.As one might predict, uptake of polymer JR onto unaltered hair was an order ofmagnitude lower than for bleached hair [ 25].8.4.1.9 Desorption of Polymer JR from HairDesorption of polymer JR from hair by distilled water is very slow, and <15% wasremoved in a time period of 30 min [ 25,32]. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS at 0.1 M)solution, analogous to a shampoo, was more effective, removing more than 50% ofthe polymer in 1 min and nearly 70% in 30 min. However, a small amount ofstrongly bound polymer was still attached to the hair after SDS treatment [ 32].Attempts to remove this strongly bound polymer by multiple treatments with SDSwere not examined.
Salts were also found to be effective in removing a portion of the polymer, andtrivalent salts were more effective than divalent, which were more effective thanmonovalent. However, even after 1 week in 0.1 M lanthanum nitrate solution (La+++),approximately 40% of the polymer was still bound to the hair [ 25]. Most of theseresults were on bleached hair, but desorption experiments on chemically unalteredhair indicate related behavior.8.4 Cationic Polymers and Their Interactions with Hair 499
8.4.1.10 Effect of Surfactants on the Sorption of Polymer JRAll surfactants that have been examined, whether neutral, anionic, or cationic,decrease the uptake of polymer JR onto hair [ 23,33]. Pareth-15-9, a nonionicsurfactant, exhibited the smallest effect in decreasing the uptake of Polymer JR.Faucher and Goddard [ 23] attribute this to the relatively low afﬁnity of thissurfactant for both keratin and the polymer.R-O-(CH2-CH2-O)9-HPareth-15-9 (R = C 11 to C 15)Cocoamphoglycinate had a slightly greater effect in decreasing the uptake of JR.CH2-CH2-OHR-C-NH-CH2-CH2-NCH2-CO2HCocoamphoglycinateOPickup was greater in the presence of potassium laurate than cocoamphoglycinate.Goddard et al. [ 33] found a relatively thick, nonuniform deposit in the presence oflaurate which they attributed to precipitated calcium laurate (soap) with polymer.Anionic and cationic surfactants show the largest effect in decreasing polymer
JR uptake onto hair. The cationic myristyl benzyl dimethyl ammonium chlorideprobably functions via competitive inhibition. Anionic surfactants probably func-tion by forming association complexes that neutralize the cationic charge on thepolymer most likely forming a negatively charged species in a large excess ofanionic surfactant such as in most shampoos. Nevertheless, small amounts ofpolymer JR were still detected on the hair even in the presence of excessiveamounts of anionic surfactant [ 33].8.4.2 Cationic Polymer–Surfactant ComplexesPolymers have been shown to form association complexes with surfactants insolution [ 36–40]. Goddard and Hannah [ 31] studied the interaction of polymer JR
with anionic surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and concluded thatthis interaction occurs in two stages when anionic detergent is in excess. The ﬁrststage involves adsorption of surfactant to the polymer, forming a primary layer thatneutralizes the cationic charge on the polymer. A decrease in solubility occurs atthis stage, and the new polymer complex is highly surface-active. As the ratio ofanionic surfactant to cationic polymer increases, adsorption of a secondary layerresults, accompanied by reversal of the net charge of the total polymer complexspecies. Increased solubility also occurs.500 8 Polymers in Hair Products
Manuszak-Guerrini et al. [ 41] expanded on this understanding of the interac-tion of cationic polymers with anionic surfactants. These scientists conﬁrmedthat cationic polymers interacting with anionic surfactants do precipitate at thetheoretical charge neutralization ratio. With the polymers studied includingPolyquaternium-10 precipitation occurs at concentrations above 0.010% polymerand anionic surfactant. At concentrations <0.010% polymer, a ﬁxed concentrationof sodium dodecyl sulfate is required to produce precipitation. The ﬁxed concen-tration decreases as the charge density of the polymer increases. Further, thesescientists demonstrated that the charge density of the polymer is more importantthan the spacer length for a mono-quaternary derivative. Also these authorsdemonstrated that the relaxation rate of polymer–surfactant mixed micelle complexis very dependent on the polymer structure.Hannah et al. [ 32] determined that this type of anionic–cationic complex, formed
from 0.1% polymer JR and 1% SDS, does indeed sorb to the hair. Water can removeonly some 30% of this JR-SDS complex. SDS and salts are no more effective,leaving some 60% (approximately 0.1 mg complex per gram hair) strongly boundto the hair. Analogous complexes with other cationic polymers have been used forbinding or for increasing the substantivity of ingredients to the hair [ 3,4].8.4.3 PolyethyleneiminePolyethyleneimine (PEI) was used commercially in the 60s and shortly thereafterremoved from hair products. However, because of new and improved synthetictechniques, it started making a comeback. Furthermore, several interesting scien-tiﬁc studies have been conducted with this polymer. These studies illustrate someuseful principles relevant to the adsorption of cationic polymers to keratin ﬁbers.There are two signiﬁcant structural differences between PEI and polymer JR:• PEI has a higher charge density than polymer JR.• PEI is not quaternized, but is a polyamine.
• PEI is not quaternized, but is a polyamine.Polyethyleneimine is formed from the aziridine ethyleneimine, and its chemistryhas been reviewed by Woodard [ 42]. Although PEI is not quaternized, it is highlycationic, since a large number of its amine groups are protonated even near neutralpH. Woodard [ 42] indicated that at pH 10.5, 4% of the amine nitrogens areprotonated; at pH 8, 25%; and at pH 4, 50%. Therefore, PEI would have a chargedensity of approximately 176 at pH 8, or nearly four times the frequency of cationicsites as polymer JR.CH2-CH2 -(CH2-CH2-NH-)xNHEthyleneimine  Polyethyleneimine8.4 Cationic Polymers and Their Interactions with Hair 501
Three different polyethyleneimines have been described with regard to theirinteractions with human hair; PEI-6 (molecular weight 600); PEI-600 (molecularweight 60,000); and PEI-600E, which is PEI-600 reacted with an almost equivalentamount of ethylene oxide. This reaction with ethylene oxide forms quaternarynitrogen groups and increases the molecular weight to approximately 100,000[28,42].Chow [ 28] provided evidence for penetration of the lower-molecular-weightPEI-6 into hair. Woodard [ 42] demonstrated that sorption increases with concen-tration and with bleaching of hair, similar to polymer JR. Sorption of PEI-6 was alsoslightly greater at neutral pH compared with acidic or alkaline pH. However, sincethe charge density of PEI decreases with increasing pH, this result is not unex-pected. This PEI study was conducted in an un-buffered medium.Although a direct comparison has not been made, PEI appears to be even more
substantive to hair than polymer JR, probably because of its higher charge density.PEI-600 was sorbed onto hair and tested for desorption toward a 10% shampoosystem. After 30 min, less than 20% of the PEI was removed and only approxi-mately 30% after 6 h [ 42].The rate of PEI desorption has also been examined with radiolabeled PEI on thehair, desorbing with unlabeled PEI. Most of the polymer, >60%, could not beremoved in 24 h by this procedure [ 28,42]. This result is consistent with a slowdegree of release of PEI due to multiple ionic binding sites to the hair, because it isdifﬁcult to uncouple all of the binding sites simultaneously.PEI polymers, like polymer JR, also interact with anionic ingredients. PEI polymershave been used for increasing the substantivity of other molecules to hair [ 3,4]. PEIwas formerly used in one commercial shampoo, but has since been removed, presum-ably because ethyleneimine monomer has been labeled as a carcinogen.
8.4.4 Polyquaternium-6 and -7 Formerly Quaternium-40and -41 (Merquats)Polyquaternium-6 and 7 were originally called Merquat polymers and are another typeof cationic polymer used in hair care products [ 43]. One of these (Polyquaternium-6) isa homopolymer of dimethyldiallylammonium chloride (DMDAAC). Polyquaternium-7 is a copolymer of DMDAAC and acrylamide. Polyquaternium-6 has an averagemolecular weight of approximately 100,000. Polyquaternium-7 has an average molec-ular weight of approximately 500,000, although different molecular weights may beobtained from the suppliers. Polyquaternium-7 has been used commercially in severaldifferent conditioning shampoos.502 8 Polymers in Hair Products
CH3CH3 CH2=CHN+Cl-CO-NH2(CH2-CH=CH2)2AcrylamideDimethyldiallylammonium chlorideThe homopolymer has a charge density of approximately 126, and thecopolymer 197. Thus, both of these polymers have a relatively high charge densitycompared with polymer JR or many other cationic polymers available for use inhair care.Sykes and Hammes [ 43] described the adsorption of both of these cationicpolymers onto hair from solutions of different amphoteric and anionic surfactants.Analogous to the adsorption of polymer JR, uptake values were greater ontobleached hair than unbleached hair, and greater from amphoteric systems likecocobetaine or cocoamphyglycinate than from anionic surfactants like sodiumlauryl sulfate or triethanolammonium lauryl sulfate. The following rationaleaccounts for these ﬁndings. Sodium lauryl sulfate interacts with polymer primarilythrough an electrostatic interaction. The net result is to neutralize the charge of the
polymer and thereby reduce its afﬁnity for keratin. Amphoterics do not neutralizethe charge of the cationic polymer as effectively as do anionics. Therefore, cationicpolymers demonstrate a greater afﬁnity for keratins in an amphoteric surfactantsystem than in an anionic surfactant system.8.4.5 Other Cationic PolymersChemical suppliers to the hair products industry have made a large number ofcationic polymers available and many additional cationic polymers have beendeveloped over the past decade. Some of these polymers are carbohydrate derivedsuch as polyquaternium-4 (a grafted copolymer with a cellulosic backbone andquaternary ammonium groups attached through the diallyl dimethyl ammoniumchloride moiety; see the section on mousses and Polyquaternium 6 [ 44]); cationic
guar gums such as Guar hydroxypropyl trimonium chloride for example, JaguarC-13-S or Guar C-261; Ucare polymer LR, a lower-charge-density cationic cellu-lose derivative of polymer JR; copolymer 845 (PVP/dimethyl aminoethyl methac-rylate copolymer derivative of polyquaternium-11, but of lower charge density);copolymers of vinyl imidazole and vinyl pyrrolidone of varying charge densitycalled Luviquats; and even quaternized and amino silicone polymers andcopolymers of varying charge density. For additional details on some of these“older” cationic polymers, see the article by Idson and Lee [ 45]. PVP/DMAPA(vinyl pyrolidone, dmethylaminopropylacrylamide copolymer) has also been8.4 Cationic Polymers and Their Interactions with Hair 503
synthesized and through one study provided indications of thermal protectiveeffects against hair damage [ 46].PVP/DMAPA acrylates copolymerSome additional more recently developed cationic polymers contain three andsometimes four monomeric groups such as Polyquaternium-55 (consisting ofcopolymers of vinyl pyrollidone, dimethylaminopropyl methacrylamide andmethacryloylaminopropyl lauryldimmonium chloride provided by ISP), orPolyquaternium-53 by Nalco (copolymers of acrylic acid, acrylamide and methacry-lamidopropyltrimonium chloride) or Polyquaternium-48 by Goo Co. (a betaine, quatpolymer consisting of methacryloyl ethyl betaine, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylateand methacryloyl ethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride) and Polyquaternium-45
(methacrylamide, methacrylamido propyl trimonium and methacryloylethyl trimethylammonium chloride) sold by Rohn and Rohm and Haas and an interesting SiliconeQuaternium 18 (linear cationic amino silicone block co polymer) andPolyquaternium-68 with the trade name of Luviquat Supreme by BASF. This lattercationic styling polymer contains four different monomeric units consisting of N-vinylpyrilidone, methacrylamide, vinyl imidazole and vinyl imidazole quaternized withmethyl sulfate. The four different monomeric units of this polymer are shown below.Polyquaternium-68 Some other cationic polymers that should prove to be useful are: Polyquaternium65 that is based on copolymerizing 2-methacryloyloxy ethyl phosphorylcholinewith other momoners, Polyquaternium 69 (trade name Aqua Style 300) by ISP is acopolymer of vinyl caprolactam, vinyl pyrolidone, N-3-(dimethyl amino propyl)-methacrylamide and 3-(methacryloyl-amino) propyl-lauryl-dimethylammonium504 8 Polymers in Hair Products
chloride and has been used in hair styling gels. Polyquaternium 86 has also founduse in hair styling gels and is a composed of four monomers: vinyl pyrolidone, vinylimidazole, vinyl imidazole quaternized with methyl chloride and methacrylic acid.Polyquaternium 67 is an interesting structure composed of hydroxyethyl cellulosethat is quaternized and polymerized with two different quaternary groups. One is n-propyl-2-hydroxy-3-trimethyl ammonium units and the second quaternary group isn-propyl-2-hydroxy-3-dimethyl dodecyl ammonium units.Polyquaternium-678.5 Other Polymers8.5.1 Polypeptides and ProteinsPolymeric collagen peptides should be somewhat substantive to hair, since theycontain multiple ionic and polar sites for bonding, in addition to offering largemolecular surfaces with many sites for Van der Waals attachment. Methionine,tyrosine [ 47], and tryptophan [ 48] are amino acids or monomeric species of proteins
that have been shown to sorb onto hair from aqueous solution. Collagen-derivedpolypeptides, or polymers of amino acids, have also been shown to have an afﬁnityfor hair [ 49–51]. One would predict that these should be more substantive to hairthan their amino acid monomers.Uptake of this type of species by hair has been shown to increase with eitherincreasing hair damage or increasing polypeptide concentration. An average molec-ular weight (Mn) of about 1,000 provides optimum pickup, which decreases withhigher molecular weight [ 52] suggesting that diffusion into hair is involved.8.5 Other Polymers 505
Bleaching produces an increase in uptake at neutral pH, whereas thioglycolate-treated hair sorbs more polypeptide at alkaline pH, as does unaltered hair [ 48].Bleaching should lower the isoionic point of hair more than thioglycolate, produc-ing more swelling at neutral pH and additional anionic sites to bind polypeptides.Penetration of polypeptide mixtures into hair has been shown by Cooperman andJohnson [ 51] and is described earlier in this chapter.The desorptive action of surfactants and salts on polypeptides already sorbed tohair has not been examined as fully as for polymer JR. On the basis of theory, onewould not expect collagen-derived polypeptides to be as substantive to hair as high-charge-density cationic polymers such as Merquats [ 43] or Luviquat FC 905 [ 53].8.5.2 Neutral and Anionic PolymersThe low isoelectric point of hair, near pH 3.6 [ 24], suggests that the net charge on
the hair ﬁber surface is negative in the presence of most hair care products (at anypH above the isoelectric point). Table 8.3describes structural formulas for some ofthe neutral and anionic polymers that have been used in hair products.These structures and the isoelectric point of hair suggest that the primary bindingof these molecules to hair is by polar and Van der Waals interactions. Sinceshampooing is in an aqueous system, and water is a good hydrogen bond breakingTable 8.3 Some neutral and anionic polymers used in hair productsCH2CH2 CH2CH2 CH2CH3CHCH CHOOCNONOR1O OOHnPolyvinyl pyrolidoneAn ethoxylated ester polymerCopolymer of PVP & vinyl acetaten506 8 Polymers in Hair Products
agent, the principal binding to resist shampooing for this kind of structure comesfrom Van der Waals attractive forces. Therefore, anionic and neutral polymers arenot highly substantive to hair. Therefore, they have been used in applications wheretheir ease of removal by shampoos is almost as important as their adhesional andﬁlm properties.8.5.3 Some Newer Polymer Types for Hair CareA few block copolymers have been described in the scientiﬁc literature for hair careproducts [ 54] as well as in patents. These would seem to provide an excellent newtype of polymer to provide unique properties for hair products. Fractal polymers ordendrimers, which are large molecules with regular branching, would also appear tobe another new area to offer promising new molecules for hair care formulation[55]. Dendrimers are produced by stepwise synthesis in which branches are linked
in stages. One example of such a structure is FPEC (fractal poly-epsilon caprolac-tam) which has been touted to provide enhanced cleaning efﬁcacy at very lowconcentrations in surfactant solution [ 55]. Silicone Quaternium 18 (linear cationicamino silicone) is another interesting relatively block co-polymer used in hair careproducts.8.5.4 Nanochemistry, Nanoparticles and Hair Care CosmeticsThe area of nanogels and the generation and use of nanoparticles in hair cosmeticsis an area that is beginning to receive attention. Nanogels of polyacrylamide andpolyacrylic acid have been created and shown to be capable of encapsulatingmolecules [ 56]. These have been suggested to offer the slow release of fragrancesand the potential for improved release of active ingredients such as antidandruffagents, etc. In addition, a symposium was conducted in 2006 in which one of themajor topics was nanochemistry for cosmetics. Therefore, this subject is one of
increasing interest yet is in its technological and applied infancy in our ﬁeld.8.6 Hair Fixatives8.6.1 Hair SpraysThe Liquinet Corporation in Chicago introduced aerosol hair sprays into themarketplace in 1949 [ 57]. Hair sprays have enjoyed considerable commercialsuccess for several decades. However, hair spray sales peaked during 1969 and8.6 Hair Fixatives 507
began to decline owing to public acceptance of more natural hairstyles not requiringhair ﬁxatives.In the early to mid 1970s, hair spray sales declined even further because ofenvironmental pressures to restrict the use of ﬂuorocarbons in aerosol products. Thelarge drop in hair spray sales occurred in 1975, after Roland and Molina theorizedhow ﬂuorocarbons deplete the ozone layer in the stratosphere. As indicated in theintroductory section to this chapter, there has been a great deal of researchconcerned with lowering VOC’s in hair care products, and in particular for hairsprays. Furthermore, the California (CARB) regulations outlined in the introductionare the driving force behind these efforts.Three types of hair sprays are being produced today: pump hair sprays, hydro-carbon or dimethyl ether aerosols, and carbon dioxide aerosols. The ﬁrst two of
these products account for the major sales for this type of product. Hydrocarbonaerosol hair sprays contain an alcohol-hydrocarbon solvent-propellant system, asynthetic polymeric resin, a base to neutralize the resin if it is a carboxylic acid-containing resin, plasticizer(s), fragrance and, in some cases, surfactant(s)toimprove the spreading characteristics of the polymer. Most of the new low VOCaerosol hair sprays contain alcohol-water as the solvent system and dimethyl etheras the propellant. Together the alcohol-dimethyl ether content must be below 55%.For cost considerations, dimethyl ether is a useful propellant, although Hydroﬂuo-rocarbon 152-A is exempt as a VOC and provides acceptable, but expensiveformulations with most resins including previously used resins [ 58]. In severalcounties, there are no VOC limits so hydrocarbon-alcohol systems with virtually nowater in these systems can be formulated and sold.
The new low VOC systems with high water content for many of today’s “older”resins provide too high a viscosity for spraying. As a result, newer, low molecularweight versions of some of these resins or totally new resins are being touted for thelow VOC solvent-propellant systems [ 59]. For example, Polyurethane-1 (LuvisetPUR. a polyesterdiol-dimethylol propionic acid caped with diisocyanate-amineends and 100% neutralized with AMP) is useful. A lower molecular version ofNational Starch’s Amphomer LV-71 consisting of (octylacrylamide/acrylates/butylaminoethyl methacrylate copolymer) can be used in low VOC systems, butother newer resins are even more effective for low VOC products [ 60].Other useful polymers are DynamX from National Starch (polyurethane-14 AMPacrylates copolymer), Aquaﬂex FX-64 (isobutylene/ethylmaleimide/hydroxyethyl-maleimide copolymer, see Table 8.4) and Allianz LT-120 (acrylates/C1-2 succinates/
hydroxyacrylates copolymer) from ISP, Luviset PUR and Polyquaternium 68 bothfrom BASF. The structure of Polyquaternium-68 is described above under cationicpolymers.Improved dispensing systems to handle the new formulations are also useful [ 58]and are generally recommended with some of the formulations offered by theleading resin suppliers cited in the previous paragraph. Sometimes single polymersshow deﬁciencies (performance or cost) in low VOC systems and mixtures ofpolymers are sometimes employed to overcome these deﬁciencies [ 61]. Normally,higher concentrations (about 30% more) of the lower molecular weight polymers508 8 Polymers in Hair Products
must be used to provide equivalent holding power to the higher molecular weightresins. Because of the high water content in the new low VOC systems low levels ofcorrosion inhibitors such as sodium benzoate or cyclohexylamine are often used,but usually at low concentrations (about 0.1–0.2%).Pump sprays are very similar to aerosol sprays and consist of solvent(s), asynthetic polymeric resin, a base to neutralize the resin (for carboxylic acid-containing resins), plasticizer(s), and in some cases a surfactant and a fragrance.For the low VOC pump systems, ethanol-water is the preferred solvent.Table 8.4 Some resins used in hair sprays (see text and [ 1,58–68] for newer polymers)CH2CH2 CH2 CH2CH2CH2 C=OC=OCH3CH3CH3COOHCOCH3OO-CH3Copolymer of vinylacetate and crotonic acidCopolymer of methyl vinyl ether and a half ester of maleic anhydrideCH2-C----- CH-CH- ---- CH2-C----- CH-CH-H3C C=O C=OO-CO-CH3(-CH2-CH-CH-CH2-)(-CH2-CH-)

The resins of all hairsprays are usually synthetic polymers and are the primaryingredient that determines the holding properties of the hair ﬁxative product.Nevertheless, considerable control over the properties of the ionic resins may beachieved by altering the spray characteristics of the product. The degree of neutral-ization and the type of neutralizer, plasticizer, or type of surfactant employed arealso important to the properties of the hair ﬁxative.Set holding under conditions of changing humidity (especially changes to ahigher humidity) is critical to hair spray performance. At the same time, the hairspray ﬁxative system must also be capable of being washed out of the hair by anaqueous detergent system. Thus careful balance of these properties is required toensure good set stability at high humidity with good washout characteristics.Synthetic polymeric resins selected for hair spray use are generally anionic or
neutral resins rather than cationic to help ensure good washout characteristics. Priorto development of synthetic polymers with a wide range of properties, “hairlacquers” were generally alcoholic solutions of benzoin, rosin, or shellac [ 62].These products provided excellent style retention; however, they were difﬁcult towash out of hair. In the early 1950s, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) was introduced asa hair-setting agent. This polymer permitted moderate set properties with goodwashout characteristics. A few years after the introduction of PVP, even better hairsetting resins were developed.Hair sprays, setting lotions, and mousses are related in the sense that each of
these products applies a resinous material to the hair and helps to maintain styleretention by enhancing interﬁber interactions. If the hair is not combed after theresin has set (after the solvent evaporates), rigid contact sites of resin are formedbetween ﬁbers, analogous to strip welding (Figs. 8.1and8.2). This type of interﬁberbonding provides the mechanism for set retention of a hair spray.When the product is applied to wet hair and the hair is set and combed, after thesolvent evaporates (as for styling lotions and mousses), the deposited polymer stillinﬂuences the hair assembly character, by increasing the interﬁber forces, but not asFig. 8.1 Two hair ﬁbersbonded together with hairspray510 8 Polymers in Hair Products
much through rigid interﬁber contacts (Fig. 8.3). Many different types of syntheticpolymers have been introduced into the marketplace for hair spray use. Chemicalstructures for three functional and popular types of resins in use today are describedin Table 8.4. The polyvinyl pyrrolidone-type resins are usually copolymers ofpolyvinyl pyrrolidone and vinyl acetate (PVP-VA). These copolymers are morefunctional than PVP itself, although PVP is widely used in setting lotions and incheaper hair sprays. A second system widely used for several years is a copolymer ofvinyl acetate and crotonic acid. This resin is generally superior to the PVP type resinsfor hair spray use. Another very functional and popular hair spray resins in retail saletoday is the ethyl ester of the copolymer of polyvinyl methyl ether and maleicanhydride (Table 8.4). This product is difﬁcult to use in a low VOC high waterFig. 8.2 Two hair ﬁbersbonded with a hair spraywhere the resin is beginningto ﬂake

system, even with lower molecular weight modiﬁcations. The butyl ester of thiscopolymer has also been used and is generally superior to the ethyl ester for styleretention; however, because of some limitations in fragrance selection for the butylester, the ethyl ester has been the most frequently used derivative of this copolymer.Other, more structurally complex resins, that are highly functional, and in usetoday are this copolymer of three monomers (vinyl acetate, crotonic acid, and vinylneodecanoate), and a polymer formed from octylacrylamide, t-butylaminoethylmethacrylate, and two or more monomers consisting of acrylic acid, methacrylicacid, or their simple esters (Table 8.5). This type of polymer provides a lowmolecular weight version acceptable in low VOC systems; however it is veryexpensive when used at 30% higher concentration for optimal holding power.The solvents in pump sprays are limited to alcohol-water mixtures and are therefore
not as complex as the solvent-propellant mixtures of aerosols. Generally, ethyl alcoholis the primary solvent, and water the secondary solvent. In some cases, small quantitiesof propanols or even glycols are used. The solvent and of course the pump spraysystem largely determine the spray characteristics of a given product which are veryimportant to the functional character of the product [ 58]. The solvent-propellantsystems of today’s hydrocarbon aerosol hair sprays used outside the US generallyconsist of alcohol combined with hydrocarbons such as isobutene, butane or propaneand virtually no water. For low VOC systems, dimethyl ether is a useful propellant andacetone may be used as high as 10% and is useful because it is not considered a VOC.For additional details on aerosol propellants for hair sprays see the previousdiscussion on VOC propellants and the article by Root [ 57]. The solvent-propellantin both aerosol and pump sprays contain the VOC and present the apparent

environmental problem. As stated, the CARB regulations for 1999 of 55% VOCpresent the target that has stimulated research and development in this area.The ability of the resin to spread over the hair surface is largely a function of theresin and is determined by its surface tension and the viscosity of the system.Nevertheless, spreading characteristics of resins can often be improved by addingsurfactants [ 69]. Nonionic or cationic surfactants are generally preferable toanionics for this purpose.For resins containing carboxylic acid groups, the type of base used to neutralizethe resin [ 69], and the degree of neutralization (see Fig. 8.4) are adjusted to provideoptimum ﬁlm properties and solubility. Organic bases such as aminomethylpropanol, triisopropanol amine or aminomethyl propanediol are generally prefera-ble to inorganic bases as hair spray resin neutralizers.The structures in Table 8.5are simpliﬁed descriptions of these copolymers and
are provided primarily to illustrate the monomers forming the basic structure ofsome of these polymers. Some of the newer resins used in low VOC hairsprays andother ﬁxative products have already been described in the section on cationicpolymers. Others include Aquaﬂex FX-64 from ISP which is Isobutyhlene/ethylmaleimide/hydroxyethylmaleimide and is highly compatible with water andhas been adapted for hair sprays. This structure is shown below. A very novel onefrom ISP based on Vinyl acetate/butylMaleate/Isobornyl Acrylate copolymer hasalso found some use in hair sprays as a ﬁxative polymer.Isobutylene/ethylmaleimide/hydroxyethylmaleimideCH3OHCH2 CH2N NO OO OPlasticizers such as dimethicone, cetyl alcohol, dioctyl sebacate, or relatedingredients are often added to provide more ﬂexible, less brittle ﬁlms to minimizeﬂaking and thus to maximize luster and set holding.Fig. 8.4 Neutralization of ahair spray resin8.6 Hair Fixatives 513

Theconcentrates will be diluted with 15% A-46 Propellant (isobutane and propane) toobtain an acceptable pressure. The spray character will be adjusted with theappropriate valve system.

The above products are made by the same procedure as for the aerosol hair spray,except no propellant is used and the above represents 100% of the formula. A spritzproduct can be made from the above formulas by proportioning all ingredientsexcept solvent by about 150%. The 55% VOC product is satisfactory, but not asacceptable as the 80% VOC product primarily because of the slower drying time.Combinations of resins and tailored spray systems may be used to improve thissystem further.8.6.3 MoussesMousses are related to both hairsprays and setting lotions. Their formulations aregenerally more complex sometimes consisting of two or more polymeric resins andadditives in a water-hydrocarbon (solvent-propellant) system similar to shavingcreams. As indicated in the introduction, the CARB standard for January 1, 1994 formousse hair products was 16% but has been lowered to a maximum of 6% VOC bythe end of 2002. Therefore 6% VOC is the standard today.
The resins of mousses are generally cationic such as polyquaternium-4 orpolyquaternium-11, or cationic and neutral, or cationic and anionic combined oreven amphoteric. Polyquaternium-4 contains both hydroxyethyl cellulose anddiallyldimethylammonium chloride. This polymer is related to the quaternizedhydroxyethyl cellulose polymer depicted in Table 8.2, except the cationic groupsare formed from the diallyldimethylammonium chloride moiety attached to thecellulosic backbone. Polyquaternium-11 (quaternium-23 – Gafquat) is a copolymerof vinyl pyrrolidone and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate quaternized withdimethyl sulfate. This polymer is related to the quaternized copolymer of PVPdepicted in Table 8.2. One mousse product in retail sale contains both of these
cationic polymers. Others contain one cationic polymer and either a neutral or ananionic resin such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, vinyl acetate copolymer or a resin suchas the butyl ester of polyvinyl methyl ether, maleic anydride copolymer.Polyquaternium-68 is a newer resin that has been recommended for use in stylingand conditioning mousses. Its structure is described in the section on polycationicpolymers.Surfactants and oils are also present in most mousse formulations. Surfactantsfunction to lower the surface tension to help spread the polymer ﬁlm over the hairsurface and to support the foam character of the product. Mousses are added to wethair. They are combed through the hair without rinsing, to distribute the productthroughout the hair. The hair is then styled and dried. Mousses improve wetmanageability by lowering combing forces and they enhance body and styleretention (Table 8.9).With these products, the hair is combed dry, after the solvent has evaporated.
Therefore, they cannot provide a large number of rigid contacts as hair sprays do;however, they do enhance interﬁber attractive forces to provide increased body andimproved style retention.516 8 Polymers in Hair Products
Making procedure: For Part A, charge the water into the mixing vessel and withstirring add the Celquat until it is completely dispersed. Then add the GAFQUATand mix until homogeneous. Add the AMP followed by the Balance polymer. Whenthe solution is homogeneous, transfer this concentrate to the aerosol ﬁlling line forﬁlling with propellants and pressurizing.8.6.4 Setting/Styling Lotions and GelsThese products are related to both hair sprays and mousses. They are more similarto mousses, because they are aqueous-based or alcohol-water solvent systems.These products are applied to wet hair or sometimes to dry hair prior to setting asopposed to spraying onto dry hair (Fig. 8.3). Remember, the CARB standard forhair styling gels for January 1, 1994 is 6% VOC and is still in effect.The resins of styling or setting lotions are usually cationic, for example,
polyquaternium-11 (copolymer of vinyl pyrrolidone and dimethylaminoethyl meth-acrylate quaternized with dimethyl sulfate, similar to the quaternized copolymer ofPVP depicted in Table 8.2) – anionic – for example, butyl ester of polyvinylmethylether and maleic anhydride – neutral – for example, copolymer of polyvinylpyrrolidone, vinyl acetate – or even polyvinyl pyrrolidone itself with polyacrylatethickeners. Two more recently developed cationic polymers recommended forstyling gels are: Polyquaternium 86 from BASF and Polyquaternium 69 from ISP.Since the mode of application of these products is similar to the mousse type ofproduct and involves combing the product through wet hair prior to setting anddrying and then re-combing the hair after it has dried, these products do not functionby forming rigid bonds in the same manner as hair sprays.

Many of the methods described in this sectionwere developed primarily for hair spr ay formulation and evaluation. Styleretention is without question the most impo rtant property of hair sprays, there-fore several approaches to evaluatin g hair spray holding power have beendescribed in the literature [ 70–72]. One novel approach by Ganslaw and Koehler[73] involves measurement of the rate of unt wisting of hair swatches treated withhair ﬁxative solution. This method has b een called twist retention analysis. It
correlates with curl retention and is claimed to allow for more rapid evaluationof data.Frosch and Vogel [ 74] developed an approach involving measurement of theforce required to break polymer treated hair strands. Another approach, is theTable 8.12 Spray-on gelformulationIngredient PercentagePVP/VA copolymer 4.0Isosteareth-20 1.0DMDM hydantoin 0.7Octyl salicylate 0.3Disodium EDTA 0.2Fragrance 0.2Water (deionized) 93.68.7 Evaluation of Hair Fixative Products 519
method by Wickett and Sramek [ 75,76]. This method involves determining theadhesive strength of hair/hairspray junctions by determining the force required topull apart two hair ﬁbers joined by a ﬁxed quantity of hair spray. Another approachcalled dynamic hairspray analysis involves determining the stiffness, rate of drying,duration of tack and maximum tack forces of hair tresses in the form of omegaloops [ 77].Most of these methods are also used to develop and to evaluate hair settingproducts and mousses. Very recently, Lang and Sendelback [ 78] reviewed a largenumber of test methods for the evaluation of hair spray polymers and products. Oneof their primary conclusions was, although several interesting and useful methodshave been introduced into the scientiﬁc literature for ﬁxative polymer evaluation,the well-known curl retention test is still the fastest and most accurate method forobtaining useful information about the holding properties of hair spray polymers.
But, in addition to style or curl retention, several other laboratory tests arehelpful to characterize the following properties of hair sprays:• Product spray characteristics.• Film properties.Among the more important spray characteristics are spray rate, spray pattern,and droplet size. Of course, safety considerations related to ﬂammability are alsoimportant.For mousses, measurement of foam properties including foam volume, foamquality, and foam stability is critical to the performance of this type of product.Although such tests have not been described for mousse evaluation, per se, minormodiﬁcation to shave cream foam tests should provide satisfactory procedures.Film properties of these products are crucial to performance, and severalmethods to evaluate ﬁlm properties of hair spray products have been developed[70,79,80]. Erlemann [ 70] described a variety of methods both subjective and
objective to evaluate hair spray ﬁlms formed on different substrates including metalplates or glass, on ﬂexible foils or tissues, and on hair. Ayer and Thompson [ 79]describe evaluation of hair spray properties by scanning electron microscopy.8.8 Silicone Polymers in Hair Care ProductsDimethicones described above in the ﬁxatives section are probably the most widelyused silicones in hair care. They are the primary active ingredients of two in oneshampoos and of many hair conditioners. As a general rule, the higher the molecu-lar weight the more deposition and conditioning provided by this type of silicone.
However, the higher the molecular weight the more difﬁcult the silicone is toformulate into an aqueous composition especially an anionic shampoo system. Asa result, optimum effects are generally achieved at a viscosity of 10,000–40,000cps. Many functionalized silicones have been introduced into the patent literatureand some of these into the market place [ 79–87]. Some examples of these are520 8 Polymers in Hair Products
aminosilicones, anionic silicones, alkyl-modiﬁed siloxysilicates [ 81] and evensilicones containing quaternary groups [ 88]. As a general rule the dimethiconetype silicones without other functionality have proven to be the most widely used todate for many compositions.Dimethicone copolyols or silicone glycol copolymers have been used asplasticizers for resins and as co-solubilizers in shampoo systems. Because of thehigh water solubility (afﬁnity for water versus hair) and low total Van der Waal’sbond strength, the lower molecular weight copolyols and glycol copolymers are notgood conditioning agents for a rinse off hair product. However, Yahagi [ 87]concluded that high molecular weight dimethicone copolyols with small amountsof copolyol and therefore a low HLB (hydrophile lipophile balance) can depositonto hair and function as conditioning agents, but they are not as effective asdimethicones. Nanavati and Hami [ 86] described the adsorption of dimethicones
and dimethiconols of higher molecular weight (10,000–64,000 for dimethiconesand 220,000–280,000 for dimethiconol gums) onto hair.Dimethicones formulated into a shampoo can protect the hair against somedamaging abrasive actions of combing and brushing [ 89]. Some silicone polymerscontaining phenyl groups have high refractive indices (near 1.5) and are reported toenhance the shine of hair ﬁbers. Siloxysilicate polymers containing alkyl groupslonger than C12 have been described by Berthiaume and Baum [ 81] to increase hairbody. These same authors describe ester siloxysilicate polymers for conditioninghair, but they are less substantive to hair than alkyl siloxysilicates where the alkylgroups are C 12 or longer.Gamez-Garcia [ 90] demonstrated that an aqueous solution of a proteinpolysiloxane copolymer at 2% could prevent cuticle cracking from thermal cycling,see Chap. 9for details of this effect. A cystine polysiloxane polymer has been
shown by Gamez-Garcia [ 91] to be capable of re-cementing cuticle scales that havebeen previously lifted.Amino functional silicones, on the other hand, have been used in hair con-ditioners and shampoos for several years to improve hair conditioning. Becauseof the potential cationic charge on amino functional silicones, it is sometimesmistakenly accepted that all amino silicones are more substantive to hair thandimethicones in all systems. Several years ago we conducted a study amongamodimethicones of varying molecular weight (about 1,000–60,000 Da) and chargedensity. We found that adsorption to hair from an anionic shampoo in an aqueousmedium is more a function of molecular weight than charge of the silicone.
Consistent with this effect is the fact that the amount of dimethicone adsorbed tohair generally increased with increasing molecular weight. Apparently, for siliconepolymers that are emulsiﬁed or dispersed in an aqueous medium, because of theirlow water solubility, entropy is important to the adsorption process.There is oftentimes more entropy or random structural organization for a siliconemolecule to adsorb to a hair ﬁber surface than to emulsify or disperse it into anaqueous system. To form such a stable emulsion or dispersion requires a great dealof structural organization. Therefore, when the silicone can adsorb with an increasein entropy the process becomes entropy driven. For lower molecular weight8.8 Silicone Polymers in Hair Care Products 521
silicones in a neutral medium, charge could be more important and could overrideentropy-involved factors.Dimethicone conditioning agents in anionic shampoos are dispersed as largeparticles generally about 20 mm in diameter. The particle size of the disperseddimethicone and the dispersing agents are important to the overall conditioningdelivered. For example, if one takes a good conditioning dimethicone shampoo andhomogenizes it so that the particle size decreases appreciably conditioning isdecreased and can be totally eliminated. The stabilizing agents or suspendingagents used in the formulation are also important to conditioning. In one of theﬁrst patents on dimethicone containing conditioning shampoos the stabilizing agentwas claimed to be fatty amide. However, intensive study revealed that the poly-meric gum also played a signiﬁcant role in product stability. Furthermore it has
been shown that one can decrease conditioning by simply increasing the amount ofpolymeric gum stabilizer in the system. Long chain fatty alcohols have also beenused as stabilizing agents. These alcohols have also been shown to adsorb onto thehair with the dimethicone.It is well known that dimethicone polymers formulated into a shampoo systemadsorb more readily onto undamaged hair than onto damaged hair and even morereadily onto root ends of hair than tip ends. This is because dimethicones are sohydrophobic that the more the hair is damaged, the more hydrophilic the hair
surface becomes and the less the hydrophobic silicone adsorbs to it. One way tocompensate for this poor afﬁnity that results from increasing hair damage is to usecationic polymeric bridging agents. Some cationic polymers can function as bridg-ing agents, especially on damaged hair by increasing the afﬁnity between the hairand the hydrophobic silicone. This concept is related to the work of Nanavanti andHami [ 86], and others, who demonstrated that adsorption and conditioning ofdimethicones onto bleached hair can be enhanced by formulation with quaternaryammonium compounds.The concept of bridging agents in these systems is useful because the quaternary
ammonium polymer has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic sites. Therefore it has ahigher afﬁnity for the hydrophilic damaged hair ﬁber surface than the silicone.Thus, the bridging agent creates more binding of silicone to the hair surface in oneof two possible ways. It either binds to the hair surface making that surface morereceptive to the hydrophobic silicone or it binds to the silicone making the siliconeparticles more attractive to the hair surface. In either event, more silicone isadsorbed onto the hair surface and conditioning of damaged hair is made moreeffective. Berthiaume and Jachowicz [ 92] demonstrated that polydimethyl
siloxanes from 50 to 12,500 cSt in aqueous emulsions deposit more readily ontohair that has been pretreated with a cationic polymer (poly-dimethacrylamidopro-pyltrimethyl ammonium chloride) than onto untreated hair. This one experimentsuggests that the cationic polymer likely ﬁrst deposits onto the hair surface increas-ing the afﬁnity of the hair for the hydrophobic silicone. One must also keep in mindthat a quaternary ammonium polymer (at a low concentration) in an anionicshampoo system (with a high concentration of anionic surfactant) is neutralizedand suspended partly by the anionic surfactant. Therefore, it becomes a negatively522 8 Polymers in Hair Products
charged species, but it still can have a higher afﬁnity for the damaged hair surfacethan the very hydrophobic silicone.Similar to cationic polymers, low concentrations of amino silicones in an anionicshampoo are essentially anionic species because of complex formation with theexcess anionic surfactant. These complexes helps to explain why the adsorption ofamino silicones from an anionic shampoo is largely dependent on molecular weight(sorption increases with molecular weight) rather than on charge density of theamino groups. Sorption is also dependent on the structure of the anionic surfactantemployed.8.9 In-Situ Polymerizations in HairWith the exception of oxidation hair dyes, in situ polymerizations in hair have beenonly laboratory and concept curiosities. However, remarkable changes to the chemi-cal [93] and physical properties [ 94] of the ﬁbers have already been achieved using
this technology. In the future, through the combination of science and imagination,some in-situ polymerization hair treatment may end up in the marketplace. Theremaining sections of this chapter describe oxidation dyes as in-situ polymerizationhair treatments and in-situ vinyl polymerization reactions in human hair.8.9.1 Oxidation Dye Reactions as In Situ PolymerizationReactionsAlthough not generally described as such, certain reactions of oxidation hair dyesare examples of in-situ polymerizations in hair. These consist of the oxidation ofelectron-rich aromatic amine and phenol monomers that condense with each otherand perhaps even attach to amino acid residues of hair. The net result, at least withproducts containing p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and resorcinol, is the formation ofpolyindophenol-type polymeric pigments [ 95–97] that render color to the hair. (Seethe discussion on oxidation hair dyes in Chap. 5and its references for additionaldetails.)
details.)8.9.2 In-Situ Polymerization of Vinyl Monomers in HairSeveral techniques have been employed for the polymerization of vinyl monomerson and in wool ﬁber.• Reduction of the ﬁbers, followed by reaction with vinyl monomer and oxidizingagent in an inert atmosphere [ 98,99].8.9 In-Situ Polymerizations in Hair 523
• Radiation grafting [ 100,101].• The Wurlan Process [ 102] – which is the condensation of diamines and diacidchloride in the presence of wool ﬁber.The procedure that has been most thoroughly studied for polymerization intohuman hair is related to the ﬁrst procedure above, that is the reduction of the ﬁbers(in an air atmosphere) [ 103,104] followed by reaction with vinyl monomer and anoxidizing agent.8.9.3 Mechanism of ActionPolymerization of a vinyl monomer into human hair is a complicated, multi-stepprocess that may be summarized by the following reaction scheme:1. Diffusion of reducing agent into the ﬁbers.2. Nucleophilic cleavage of the sulfur-sulfur bond by reducing agent.3. Water rinse.4. Diffusion of oxidizing agent into the ﬁbers.5. Reaction of reduced hair and oxidizing agent.6. Diffusion of vinyl monomer into the ﬁbers.7. Chain-initiating reactions.8. Chain-propagating reactions.9. Termination of free radical chains.Steps 1 through 3
Steps 1 through 3Among the reducing agents that have been employed in this type of process arethioglycolic acid (TGA) [ 90], bisulﬁte [ 79], and tetrakis (hydroxymethyl) phospho-nium chloride (THPC) [ 104]. The critical point in this step is the extent ofreduction, since each of these reducing agents provides increasing polymer add-on with increasing time of reduction (Fig. 8.5). Comparison of the TGA systemwith the bisulﬁte system shows a faster rate of polymerization with TGA than withbisulﬁte. This rate difference is consistent with a faster rate of reduction of hair byTGA. Since the reaction of TGA with human hair is diffusion-controlled [ 105], step
2 is extremely important to the overall kinetic scheme. But, since cleavage of thesulfur-sulfur bond by TGA is faster than diffusion, Step 2 seems of lesser impor-tance to the overall kinetic scheme than Step 1. However, the extent of disulﬁdeﬁssion is a controlling factor in the remaining steps: the diffusion of initiator(oxidizing agent) and monomer into the ﬁbers.The effect of pH during reduction is very important to both the TGA [ 103] andthe THPC [ 104] systems. In the case of the TGA system, reduction rate increaseswith pH, and polymer add-on increases similarly. For the THPC system, pH is alsocritical, but not for entirely the same reason. According to Jenkins and Wolfram524 8 Polymers in Hair Products
[106], THPC dissociates in aqueous solution to Tris (hydroxymethyl) phosphine(THP), and THP is the actual ingredient that reduces the hair.P-(CH2-OH)4+Cl-P-(CH2-OH)3  +  CH2O + HCl(THP) (THPC)Wolfram [ 104] has shown that polymer add-on increases with pH of the reducingsolution, up to pH 7, where it appears to level. Thus, THPC dissociation and sulfur-sulfur bond cleavage also increase with pH up to 7. The fact that polymer add-on isnot higher at pH 9.2 than at 7.0 suggests interference of alkalinity in a subsequentreaction step. The most probable complications are in the chain initiation orpropagation steps, since Wolfram indicates that the cysteine-persulfate redox sys-tem is optimal in the pH region of 1.5–3.5.Steps 4 Through 9Both TGA-hydroperoxide and THPC-persulfate systems show a linear rela-tionship between polymer add-on and the square root of time, (Fig. 8.6)[107]. Inboth of these systems, the amount of polymer add-on can be inﬂuenced by
concentration changes in both oxidizing agent and vinyl monomer. Therefore,the diffusion of vinyl monomer and oxidizi ng agent into the ﬁbers can also be rateFig. 8.5 Inﬂuence of the reduction step on polymer add-on [ 103] (Reprinted with permission ofthe Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists)8.9 In-Situ Polymerizations in Hair 525
limiting. As a result, any variable that can accelerate diffusion of oxidizing agentand/or vinyl monomer into the ﬁbers is capable of increasing the rate of polymeradd-on.Step 5, the reaction between reduced hair and oxidizing agent, generatesthe free-radical species that initiates polymerization. For the system of Wolfram[104], this step involves reaction of THP or mercaptan of reduced hair withpersulfate. But, for the TGA system, it involves reaction of mercaptan with cumenehydroperoxide.The remaining reactions, steps 8 and 9, are classical free-radical propagation andtermination reactions, summarized by Fig. 8.7. If the chain-initiating radicals arefrom cysteine residues or other residues of the hair, then the resultant polymer isgrafted (i.e., covalently bonded to the hair protein). However, if the chain-initiatingradicals are from oxidizing agent or reducing agent, then the polymer, if inside thehair, may become entrapped as it grows.
8.9.4 Solvent System and Its Effect on PolymerizationFor the TGA-cumene hydroperoxide system, an ethanol water solvent wasemployed for monomer and initiator. The data clearly demonstrate maximumFig. 8.6 Inﬂuence of reaction time (steps 4–9) on polymer add-on [ 103] (Reprinted with permis-sion of the Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists)526 8 Polymers in Hair Products
add-on with larger proportions of water in the system, providing greater hairswelling, consistent with diffusion rate control [ 101].8.9.5 Polymerization into Chemically Altered HairBleaching increases the permeability of hair. However, bleaching also decreases thedisulﬁde content, and the disulﬁde bonds are potential sites to form mercaptangroups, a part of the redox system. Therefore, it was of interest to determine whichof these two parameters, permeability or mercaptan content, might contribute moreto the rate of polymer add-on. Hair was bleached to varying extents with alkalinehydrogen peroxide and then treated with a bisulﬁte-cumene-hydroperoxide system,using methyl methacrylate monomer. The data clearly show increasing polymeradd-on with decreasing disulﬁde cross-links (Table 8.13), once again emphasizingthe importance of diffusion rate control to this process [ 103]. Figure 8.8showsFig. 8.7 Chain initiation, propagation, and termination stepsTable 8.13 Polymerization

cross-sections of polymethyl methacrylate grafted hair ﬁbers with a low add-on(top – 16% add-on) and a high add-on (bottom >100% add-on). Grafting was alsocarried out on reduced-oxidized hair, that is, hair that was permanent waved tovarying extents prior to treatment with the polymerization system [ 103]. This hairalso provided very large add-ons.8.9.6 Evidence for Polymer in the HairHair after treatment with TGA-cumene hydroperoxide using methyl methacrylatemonomer was hydrolyzed, using 5 N hydrochloric acid. Acid hydrolysis dissolvedaway the keratin from the polymer. Part of the resultant ﬁber-like residue wasdissolved in organic solvents. The solute (in the organic solvents) was shown to bepoly methyl methacrylate by refractive index and infrared spectroscopy [ 101].Fig. 8.8 Cross-sections ofhair ﬁbers containing twodifferent amounts ofpolymethyl methacrylate.Top: Fibers containing 16%add-on. Bottom : Fiberscontaining more than 100%add-on528 8 Polymers in Hair Products
Viscosity average molecular weights of this polymer were determined frombleached, permanent waved and chemically unaltered hair and found to be rela-tively constant near 90,000 Da. This result suggests an average degree of polymeri-zation of approximately 900.Scanning electron micrographs of the surface of hair ﬁbers treated with theTGA-cumene hydroperoxide system using methyl methacrylate monomer show athick coating of polymer on the hair ﬁber surface. However, the ﬁbers still retainrepeating irregularities perpendicular to the ﬁber axis, which correspond to scaleedges covered with a thick coating of polymer (Fig. 8.9)[103].Fig. 8.9 Scanning electron micrographs of PMM-containing hair ﬁbers [ 103].Upper left : Surfaceof hair ﬁbers containing 16% PMM add-on.

As indicated, ﬁberlike fragments were isolated from polymethyl methacrylateafter hydrolyzing away much of the keratin with 5 N hydrochloric acid. These“synthetic ﬁbers” after hydrolysis were examined in cross section and at the ends.From hair with large amounts of polymer add-on (near 100% weight gain), these“ﬁbers” were almost complete cylinders of porous polymethyl methacrylatethreads, whereas hair with lower polymer add-ons (10–20% weight gain) yieldedthin-walled hollow cylinders (Fig. 8.9). The ﬁbrous structure illustrated in Fig. 8.10was obtained after treatment of polymethyl methacrylate containing hair withnearly 100% add-on with sodium sulﬁde to partially dissolve away much of thehair proteins. Note the hollow cylinder of polymer remaining reminiscent of ringdyed hair. Figure 8.11 depicts additional micrographs illustrating the polymer-hair
structures after polymerizing methyl methacrylate onto and into hair (no hydroly-sis) with very large add-ons of about 100%. These observations are consistent withdiffusion rate control for this in situ vinyl polymerization process.8.10 Safety Considerations for PolymersSafety considerations for products containing polymers are often related to thecomponents other than the polymer (monomers, catalysts, etc.) rather than thepolymers. The polymers themselves are usually relatively safe ingredients. Proteinpolymers should be tested for sensitization; however, such problems are notfrequent for the types of protein hydrolysates used in hair care. “Pure” syntheticpolymers (with no monomer contaminant) are generally mild ingredients ofFig. 8.10 Hair ﬁbercontaining 119% polymethylmethacrylate reacted withsodium sulﬁde to remove alarge portion of the hair fromthe polymer [ 103] (Reprintedwith permission of the Journalof the Society of CosmeticChemists)530 8 Polymers in Hair Products
relatively low toxicity, one example being polyvinyl pyrrolidone originally used asa blood plasma extender in medicine.Safety concerns for synthetic polymers are sometimes due to contamination withmonomeric impurity. Monomers are sometimes highly toxic such as acrylamide[108], or even carcinogenic such as ethyleneimine [ 109] or vinyl chloride [ 110], orhighly irritating to skin, such as acrylamide [ 108] or acrylic acid [ 108]. Therefore,control of unreacted monomer level can sometimes be critical to the safety perfor-mance of synthetic polymers.Fig. 8.11 Top: A knottedﬁber containing more than100% polymethylmethacrylate.

Chapter 9The Physical Properties of Hair FibersAbstract This chapter describes tensile, bending and torsional testing includingdifferent parameters of each of these deformations and how these are affected bydifferent types of hair including different types of hair damage. Expanded data setsare included for elastic moduli and other parameters of these deformations. A newsection describing the historical development for assessing and measuring hair ﬁbercurvature along with a new method for curvature has been developed and applied tomore than 2,400 persons from more than 20 different countries. This method and
data are featured in this section. Methods to determine the different dimensions ofhair ﬁbers including axial (length and curvature) and transverse dimensions (diam-eter, cross-sectional area and ellipticity) are described with much expanded datasets. Information on hair ﬁber friction (both high load and low load friction) andhow friction varies with ﬁber diameter, comb composition and hair damage areincluded. Mechanical fatiguing, extension cycling and their effects on hair damageincluding scale lifting are described in the ﬁnal section on the physical properties ofhair ﬁbers.9.1 IntroductionSince the 4th edition, several important advances have been made in our under-standing of the more important physical properties of hair ﬁbers. A new method forhair ﬁber curvature Segmentation Tree Analysis Method (STAM) classiﬁes thisimportant property into eight different curl types. This method has been applied tomore than 2,400 persons from several different countries over the three most
important geo-racial groups (linking geography with race) across ﬁve continents.This quantization of hair ﬁber curvature is signiﬁcant because of the importance ofhair ﬁber curvature to all cosmetic hair assembly properties. As a result, I haveattempted to assign hair curvature by STAM to as many parts of this text as feasible.Additional data on hair diameters, ellipticity, elastic modulus, breaking stressand other important parameters are presented using larger data sets than in previousC.R. Robbins, Chemical and Physical Behavior of Human Hair ,DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-25611-0_9, #Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012537
editions. New data on the effects of age and sex on scalp hair diameter arepresented. This discussion includes new ﬁndings on the effects of the menopauseon the scalp hair diameter of females. Variation of ﬁber diameter and ellipticityalong the hair shaft and age effects on cross sectional area, ellipticity, curvature andthe scale index have also been added.New and important ﬁndings on torsional and bending properties of damaged hairand the effects of different treatments on these properties have been included.Torsional properties have been under-utilized and are potentially just as importantas tensile properties because torsion can reveal damage and prospective repair tothe cuticle as well as the cortex, an inherent weakness of tensile testing. Torsionalproperties are also more sensitive to relative humidity changes or water content inthe ﬁbers than tensile properties. Additional evidence has been provided to conﬁrm
that tensile properties reside essentially in the cortex and not the cuticle for humanhair ﬁbers. Torsional measurements can also detect changes induced by hair sprayﬁlms and conditioner binding in the cuticle that tensile measurements cannotdiscern. The relationship between structure and adhesion failure (fracture forma-tion) in different parts of the hair is also presented.Useful information on how hair is degraded with hot combs and by alkaline hairstraighteners has been added in sections dealing with hair damaging treatments.New ﬁndings showing the importance of bending stiffness and friction on hairhandle or feel is also described in Chap. 10and a new approach to the assessment oftactile hair properties using a psycho-physiological technique has been offered inthe literature.For the main discussion in this chapter, the physical properties of human hairhave been divided into two categories:Elastic deformationsOther important physical properties
Other important physical propertiesAnother important classiﬁcation that will be referred to routinely is singleﬁber and ﬁber assembly properties. Some of the more important single ﬁberproperties described in this chapter are curvature, elastic deformations, friction,cross-sectional area (diameter), ellipticity and cohesive/adhesive forces.Elastic deformations include stretching (tensile properties, cyclic extension andfatiguing), bending including stiffness or the resistance to bending, and torsion(twisting) and its resistance, rigidity. Hair damage/breakage properties havebecome of paramount importance to cosmetic science and hair breakage is describedin Chap. 10. Tensile testing has been used for decades to assess damage to hair, buttensile testing does not closely simulate damaging/breakage effects from hairgrooming.The density of hair (mass/volume) is considered in this chapter followed by ﬁber
dimensions including diameter, ellipticity, cross-sectional shape, and curvaturefollowed by ﬁber friction as other important physical properties.The last section of this chapter deals with fatigue testing, extension cycling andﬂex abrasion which are becoming more widely used because the former twomethods simulate some of the damaging effects of grooming actions and can reveal538 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
damage to the cuticle at a level that tensile testing cannot, while ﬂex abrasion moreclosely simulates a few of the actions involved in hair breakage.Several years ago, Robbins and Scott [ 1] hypothesized that most consumerassessments of hair (properties of ﬁber assemblies such as combing ease, styleretention, ﬂyaway, body, and manageability) may be approximated by algebraicexpressions involving the single ﬁber properties of friction, stiffness, static charge,ﬁber curvature, weight, diameter, luster, and color. Hough et al. [ 2] described asomewhat similar analysis of hair body. Robbins and Reich [ 3] determined empiri-cal relationships between combing ease and the ﬁber properties of friction, stiff-ness, ﬁber curvature, and diameter. This work demonstrated that hair assemblyproperties can indeed be deﬁned by a few fundamental single ﬁber properties.Robbins has taken the conclusions from this study and proposed a general hypoth-
esis for hair behavior. This general approach of relating ﬁber assembly behavior tosingle ﬁber properties has been expanded and is the basis for the discussion onconsumer assessments in Chap. 10.9.2 Tensile Extension and Deformations9.2.1 Deﬁnitions and Conditions Important to Tensile ExtensionFor every “strain” (deformation) of an elastic substance, there is a corresponding“stress” (the tendency to recover its normal condition). The units of stress are forceper unit area (F/A). The most common types of strain are stretching or elongation(the ratio of an increase in length to the original length), linear compression (theratio of a decrease in length to the original length), shear (the ratio of the displace-ment of one plane relative to an adjacent plane), bending, and torsion [ 4]. Theselatter two strains are combinations of the former three. Only stretching, bending,and torsional strains are considered in this chapter. For a summary of stress strain
models see the section entitled Stretching Hair and Stress Strain Models in Chap. 1.Each type of stress and strain has a modulus (the ratio of stress to strain) that alsohas units of F/A. The elastic modulus for stretching is commonly called Young’smodulus. The bending modulus is called Young’s modulus of bending, and thetorsional modulus is called the modulus of rigidity. But, keep in mind that theseelastic moduli for stretching, bending and torsion apply to only limited amounts ofdeformation (small% strains) for hair ﬁbers over the “elastic” region.Human hair has been referred to as a substrate with only one dimension,“length,” suggesting why its tensile properties have been studied more than its
other elastic properties. The usual procedure for evaluating the stretching propertiesof human hair involves stretching a ﬁber of known length (we usually used 5 cmﬁbers), at a ﬁxed rate (a convenient rate is 0.25 cm/min) in water, in buffer, or at aﬁxed relative humidity (approximately 60% RH), near room temperature on anautomated instrument such as an Instron Tensile Tester (Fig. 9.1) or a Dia-Stron9.2 Tensile Extension and Deformations 539
Tensile Module. It is unfortunate that there is no standard test conditions in thecosmetic industry for this widely used procedure.Tensile properties are whole ﬁber properties, as opposed to surface propertiesand evidence is strong that tensile properties are primarily cortical propertiesand not related to the cuticle. This experimental evidence is described next in thischapter with accepted models described in Chap. 1that explain stretching and waterabsorption in terms of the cortex [ 5] with no cuticle involvement. Wolfram andLindemann [ 6] suggested that the cuticle might contribute to the tensile properties,especially in ﬁne hair. However, Scott (personal communication) provided supportfor the “no cuticle involvement” hypothesis, by evaluating the tensile properties ofhair ﬁbers that were abraded under controlled conditions. In no instance could hedemonstrate a signiﬁcant change in tensile properties where only cuticle had beenabraded.
Robbins and Crawford [ 7] published the ﬁrst experimental evidence that thecortex and not the cuticle is responsible for the tensile properties of human hair byFig. 9.1 A single hair ﬁberloaded in an Instron tensiletester for load–elongationstudy540 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
showing that severe damage to the cuticle only cannot be detected by tensileproperty evaluation. This work involved selective oxidation of the cuticle withm-diperisophthalic acid and is described in more detail with SEM’s in Chap. 5.T h i soxidative treatment (m-diperisophthalic acid) produces extensive cuticle damagethat is detectable microscopically. However, this damage could not be detected byeither wet or dry tensile property evaluation. More recently, Persaud and Kamath[8] provided additional evidence that tensile properties are a property of the cortex.These scientists demonstrated that cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) in thehair can be detected by torsional measurements but not by tensile measurements.Persaud and Kamath concluded that this quaternary surfactant absorbs in the cuticleand strengthens it. They suggested that CTAB does not produce changes in the cortexand therefore could not be detected using tensile measurements.
Additional supporting evidence for the non-cuticle involvement in tensileproperties is the fact that wet extension of hair ﬁbers to 30% damages the cuticle[9] yet on relaxation in water, tensile recovery occurs producing virtually identicalelongation-recovery curves in a before and after evaluation. This basic elongation-recovery procedure (to 15%, 20%, 25% and 30% extension) is commonly usedthroughout the industry.When keratin ﬁbers are stretched, the load-elongation curve shows three distinctregions (Fig. 9.2). The lower curve in Fig. 9.2represents stretching a hair ﬁber inwater. The curve at the top of the chart represents stretching at 65% RH. In theHookean region of the load–elongation curves, the stress (load) is approximatelyproportional to the strain (elongation). The ratio of stress to strain in this region iscalled the elastic modulus (Es) or more commonly Young’s modulus. Only a few
s) or more commonly Young’s modulus. Only a fewFig. 9.2 Schematic diagram for load–elongation curves for human hair ﬁbers9.2 Tensile Extension and Deformations 541
years ago, the elastic modulus was normally expressed in units of dynes/cm2. Todayit is usually expressed as GN/m2(Giga-Newtons per meter squared or (GPa)although Mega-Newtons per meter squared (MPa) is also acceptable) and may becalculated from this simple expression:ES¼HgL =ADLwhere H ¼Hookean slope in g/mm elastic extension, g ¼gravitation constant(980.6 cm/s2), L¼ﬁber length in cm, DL¼ﬁber extension in cm, and A ¼ﬁbercross-sectional area in cm2. This provides the elastic modulus in dynes/cm2whichis converted to GN/m2by dividing by 1010.The elastic modulus for stretching human hair, determined in our laboratories at60% RH and room temperature, is 3.89 /C21010dynes/cm2or 3.89 GPa which is3,890 MPa. More data on the elastic modulus from other laboratories is describedlater in this chapter. Methods other than load–elongation have been used to deter-mine the elastic modulus of hair ﬁbers. These methods [ 10,11] are also describedlater in this chapter.
later in this chapter.Other important parameters of load–elongation curves are the Hookean limit(Fig. 9.2, Point A), the turnover point (Fig. 9.2, Point B), the percentage extensionto break, the stress to break (in the ﬁber industry called “tensile strength” but morerealistically called the extension to break), the post yield modulus (stress/strain) inthe post yield region, and the work of elongation (the total area under theload–elongation curve).An interesting study by Hamburger et al. [ 12] more than 60 years ago suggestedthat the pullout energy of cosmetically unaltered Caucasian hair at 65% RH isapproximately equal to the Hookean limit which is considerably less than the stressto break. Berthiaume et al. [ 13] published results more than 40 years later showingthat the pullout load for Caucasian hair is about 40–45 g (slightly higher than that ofHamburger et al. [ 12]), for African hair 30–35 g and for Asian hair 60–65 g. These
data suggest that most undamaged hair ﬁbers under stress will pull out beforebreaking. Scott found that more than one-half of the ﬁbers collected from combinga few heads of female Caucasian hair in our beauty salon contained bulbs andtherefore were pulled out; however 5 to about 35% of the hairs were broken. Hairﬁbers broken on heads actually exhibit different types of fracture patterns. In manycases evidence for cuticle fracturing before catastrophic failure can also be foundon hairs growing on live heads, see Chap. 6.These facts lead one to question the practical implications of tensile testinginvolving slow extension to break as a criterion for “strength”. Impact loading (byRobbins [ 14]), mechanical fatiguing (by Kamath et al. [ 15]) and extension cycling(by Gamez-Garcia [ 16]) seem to more closely simulate the damaging effects of
combing and brushing than the slow strain rates and the extreme strains of ordinarytensile testing. See the discussion on these methods and the section entitled, HowHair Fibers Break During Combing described in Chap. 10.Stretching hair ﬁbers under ambient conditions can cause damage, well beforecatastrophic failure. For example, during stretching or extension at 45% R.H., signs542 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
of cuticle separation and damage occur in regions of the cuticle (cell membranecomplex or even the endocuticle) and it occurs sooner in the cuticle of tip ends(about 10% extension) of hair ﬁbers than in the root ends (about 20% extension).Furthermore, this cuticle damage or fracturing [ 9] occurs sooner than ﬁber breakagewhich occurs at about 40–50% extension at moderate humidity and greater than50% extension in the wet state.Three important papers on the tensile fracturing of human hair were publishedby Henderson et al. [ 17] and by Kamath and Weigmann [ 18,19]. These pub-lications show that breaking or fracturing of hair ﬁbers occurs differently in thecuticle versus the cortex and fracturing of hair ﬁbers occurs in different patterns.Figure 9.3describes the four most common fracture patterns for human hair. Thefracture pattern found depends on the extent of hair damage, the relative humidity
(whether the hair is wet or dry) and whether or not the ﬁber is twisted or containsﬂaws [ 9,19].For wet hair, if the hair and its cuticle are in good condition and near the rootend, a smooth break tends to occur, see Fig. 9.4. As the ﬁber becomes dryer, below90% RH, step fractures are more commonly observed (Fig. 9.3). Fibrillation andsplitting (Fig. 9.3) are distinct cortical fracture patterns and these tend to occur morewhen the hair is in poor condition especially with oxidative damage and withtwisted or kinky ﬁbers [ 19] and when the relative humidity is low, rather thanwhen the ﬁber is wet. One reason for that effect is that the cortex is less extensiblethan the cuticle when the ﬁber is dry, below 90% RH [ 17]. See Chap. 6for electronmicrographs illustrating these different fracture patterns for hair ﬁbers.If the cuticle is in poor condition, split ends can occur upon catastrophic failure.Split ends can also occur from oxidative damage (Chap. 10) and from step fractures
and ﬁbrillation, by way of mechanical action and the subsequent abrasive actions ofcombing and brushing. See the discussion on damage to hair from shampoos,grooming and weathering in Chap. 6.Stretching in the wet state is very different than stretching in the dry state. This isbecause failure in the wet state generally involves hydrophilic layers, such as theFig. 9.3 Schematic depictingsome of the more importantfracture patterns for humanhair9.2 Tensile Extension and Deformations 543
contact zone of the CMC or the endocuticle because it involves breaking bonds inhydrophilic layers. On the other hand, failure in the dry state generally involvesbreaking bonds in or between hydrophobic layers [ 20]. For example, failure at thejunction of the Beta and Delta layers of the CMC occurs because of the weakhydrophobic bonding between branched hydrocarbons (18-MEA) and relativelyshort hydrocarbon amino acid side chains of the hydrophobic ﬁbrous proteins in theDelta layer [ 20]. This site is conducive to failure when the cuticle layers are strainedat low moisture levels. Such fractures at 65% RH or lower allow the ﬂow of cuticlepast cuticle during ﬁber extension [ 21], during extension cycling [ 20] or evenbending.Beta-Delta failure was originally cited by Negri et al. several years ago [ 22]. The
lower the relative humidity (the moisture content of the hair), the lower the strainrequired to initiate failure between the upper Beta layer and the Delta layer as notedby Gamez-Garcia [ 16].Stretching hair ﬁbers to break in the wet state (approximately 50% extension)often produces what appears to be a clean break that macroscopically resembles arazor cut, see Fig. 9.4. However, on close examination of such breaks, we see thatfracturing can occur in the cuticle (see Figs. 9.5and9.6) well before catastrophicfailure. Extension of hair ﬁbers at low RH and even low percentage extensionsgenerally induces Beta-Delta failure [ 20–22], as illustrated in Chap. 6. Extension ofhair ﬁbers to only 10–20%, at 45% RH (or especially at higher humidities) and veryslow strain rates, sometimes induces failure in the endocuticle [ 23, (Ruetsch,private communication) (see Chap. 6) very likely at or near the junction of the
endocuticle and exocuticle. Such fractures result in the separation of the surfacescales from the underlying layer producing an uplifting of scales, see Fig. 9.5andChap. 6. This type of endocuticular failure is not the norm under normal tensile-loading conditions or faster strain rates that are normally encountered in grooming.More recent evidence indicates that a very slow strain rate at higher humiditycauses shear stresses within cuticle scales and leads to this type of failure [ 23].Fig. 9.4 A hair ﬁber brokenby stretching in the wet stateillustrating a smooth fracture(SEM kindly provided bySigrid Ruetsch)544 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers

Micrographskindly provided by SigridRuetschFig. 9.6 Cracking of the cuticle caused by extension cycling to 200 strain cycles at 30% extensionat 100% RH [ 16]. This cuticle damage is similar to that caused by stretching hair to break in water(reprinted with permission of the Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemist)9.2 Tensile Extension and Deformations 545
Extensions to about 30% or slightly higher, in the wet state, can produce multiplecircumferential fracturing of the cuticle, with separation of entire cuticle sectionsfrom the cortex [ 18], see Fig. 9.6. Gamez-Garcia [ 16] demonstrated that this sametype of effect can be produced by extension cycling at even lower extensions at highrelative humidity or in water.Stretching to break in the dry state, below 90% RH but not near 0% RH ismore prone to induce uneven cortical fracturing. For example, a step fracture orﬁbrillated end or even split end is likely to result. Stretching or bending hair ﬁbersas occurs during combing or grooming operations is capable of producing stresscracks in the non-keratin regions, the endocuticle and the intercellular regions.Subsequently, scale lifting can occur in the damaged regions of the hair ﬁber, seeChap. 6.A hysteresis similar to that in Fig. 9.7is obtained, when a keratin ﬁber is
stretched up to 30% of its original length in water and then allowed to return toits original length (in water). Such a curve results in spite of potential cuticledamage (especially at high strains). The work of elongation is always greater thanthe work of recovery; thus, a hysteresis occurs, and the ratio of these two workvalues is called the resilience ratio (or hysteresis ratio) [ 24], another useful load-elongation parameter.As indicated, we normally take ﬁbers 5 cm long and stretch them to 20% of theirlength at a rate of extension and recovery of 0.25 cm/min. The rate of extensionwill inﬂuence the tensile results [ 25]. Sikorski and Woods [ 26] and Simpson [ 10]suggested an increase of approximately 5% in the elastic modulus for a tenfoldFig. 9.7 Schematic diagram for load–elongation and recovery curves for human hair ﬁbers546 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
increase in extension rate. Stretching hair ﬁbers to 20% and holding them for 4 hproduces a temporary increase in length or a temporary set [ 27].After stretching the ﬁbers and relaxing them, as described above, we allow theﬁbers to relax overnight in water. The ﬁbers can then be treated and re-stretched, thusmaking before-and-after treatment comparisons on the same ﬁbers. Such a procedure,without treatment, provides reproducible load-elongation curves, conﬁrming thevalidity of the before and after comparison. Speakman [ 28] and Sookne and Harris[29] ﬁrst suggested this type of test procedure. Speakman referred to percentagechanges in the work of extension. Harris coined the term “30% index” as the ratio oftensile values to 30% extension. An implicit assumption in this procedure is thatcalibration or stretching before treatment does not alter the reactivity of the ﬁbers.Wolfram and Lennhoff [ 30] provided evidence that supports the validity of this
assumption, however, at 30% extension cuticular damage occurs that should increasereaction rates for some reactions with stretched hair and may also affect the type offracture produced. Work and force values to 15% and 25% elongation have also beenused [ 31,32]. Since calibration elongations, especially in the vicinity of 30% orhigher, can produce cuticle damage that is not normally detected in load-elongationparameters stretching hair to lower percentage extensions (15–25%) is preferable.9.2.2 The Effects of Relative Humidity on Tensile Extensionof HairThe moisture content of human hair varies with relative humidity (RH), increasingwith increasing RH, (see the section entitled Inﬂuence of Relative Humidity onTable 9.1 Elastic modulus (MPa) verses relative humidity of hair and wool ﬁber65% RH 100% RHaRatioHuman Merino Human Merino E S65%RH/ES100% RH Hair Wool Hair WoolElastic modulus [ 27] 5,394 3,040 2,059 1,177 Hair 2.62Wool 2.58% RH Wool E Sat given RH@/ESat 100% RH

Dimensions of Hair in this chapter). Thus changes in the moisture content of hairhave a large effect on the tensile properties as shown by elastic modulus changesversus %RH in Table 9.1.Speakman [ 33] and Menkart [ 34] conducted relatively extensive load–elongation studies at several relative humidities for wool ﬁber. These data show aregular increase in extensibility (percent extension to break) with increasing RH.Even though such extensive studies could not be found in the literature for humanhair, undoubtedly a similar relationship exists, because:1. Tensile properties of hair ﬁbers at 55–65% RH compared with 100% RH (inwater) show greater extensibility at the higher humidity (Fig. 9.2) and a lowerelastic modulus (Table 9.1) and lower work and force values in general [ 34].2. The dynamic elastic modulus of human hair has been reported to respondsimilarly to changes in RH [ 35].3. There is virtually an identical quantitative binding of water to wool and hair as
a function of RH [ 36,37]. Therefore we conclude a similar stress/strain RHrelationship (see Table 9.1).9.2.3 Tensile Properties and Fiber DiameterBoth wet and dry tensile properties of chemically unaltered keratin ﬁbers aredirectly proportional to ﬁber diameter. Figure 9.8summarizes this relationship forthe dry tensile properties via a plot of the Hookean slope versus ﬁber linear densityat 62% RH. Since linear density is proportional to cross-sectional area and diame-ter, the tensile properties are also proportional to ﬁber diameter. Robbins and Scott[38] reported a procedure for determining both wet and dry tensile properties onFig. 9.8 Hair ﬁber elastic extension versus linear density (Reprinted with permission of theJournal of Cosmetic Science)548 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
the same ﬁbers from only one of these properties. This procedure depends onthis fundamental relationship, that is wet and dry tensile properties are proportionalto ﬁber diameter, and therefore, proportional to each other. An equation forpredicting the dry Hookean limit at 60% RH from the Hookean limit in water (X)is: Y/C63.75¼2.18 X and for predicting the dry stress to break (B) at 60% RHfrom the wet force to 20% extension (F) is: B /C610.3¼3.92 F.9.2.4 Tensile Properties and TemperatureRebenfeld [ 39] compared human hair with wool ﬁber by studying the effect oftemperature on the load–elongation properties in neutral buffer solution,. Increas-ing temperature has an effect similar to increasing humidity on the shape of theload–extension curve [ 39,40] (see Table 9.2). The elastic modulus for both human
hair and wool ﬁber decrease with increasing temperature, but are lower for wool atany temperature, probably because of its lower cross-link density. The post-yieldmodulus and tensile stress at break decrease with increasing temperature, whereasextensibility increases.The breaking stress ¼M g/A where M ¼load in kg, g ¼standard gravity ¼9.81 N/kg and A is the cross sectional area in meters squared.Elastic modulus ¼Mg=ADL=Lwhere M ¼kg; g ¼standard gravity 9.81 N/kg; A is the cross sectional area inmeters squared and DL/L is 2.0 and constant from 65% to 100% RH while it variesfrom 4.08 at 0% RH, to 3.21 at 17.7% RH and 2.58 at 44.2% RH as shown byFeughelman and Robinson [ 32].The turnover point (extension to B in Fig. 9.2) undergoes a transition at 85.5/C14Cfor unaltered hair and at 66/C14C for partially reduced hair.

results in terms of a disulﬁde–sulfhydryl interchange mechanism, whereby stresseddisulﬁde bonds are relieved and transformed into stress-free positions at highertemperatures.Crawford (private communication) examined the effect of temperature in adry atmosphere on the wet tensile properties of hair. Crawford found signiﬁcantchanges in the force to 20% extension after heating to 100/C14C, 25 times for 15 minintervals. Permanent-waved hair appeared to be more susceptible to heat, under-going a decrease of approximately 7%, as compared to 4% for unaltered hair.McMillen and Jachowicz [ 41] examined the effects of hot iron treatments on hairand identiﬁed a decrease in tryptophan level due to thermal induced decomposition,a small increase in the combing force and a yellowing effect on white hair.However, these scientists did not report tensile effects. A thermo-chemical tech-nique for analysis of human hair has also been reported by Humphries et al. [ 42].
For discussion of stress strain models see the section entitled Stretching Hair andStress Strain Models in Chap. 1.9.2.5 Twisting and Stretching Normal Hair and Hairwith Natural TwistsDankovich et al. [ 43] examined the effects of twisting hair ﬁbers before and duringstretching to determine the effects of twisting on tensile properties. They used twoexperimental procedures: One in which the hair was twisted at constant length,followed by extension to break while not allowing untwisting and the secondprocedure involved twisting and then untwisting at constant length followed byextension to break. Twisting an 80 micron hair ﬁber 45 turns/cm produced cata-strophic failure. Therefore lower levels of twist were examined: 11, 23 and 38 turns/cm. Only small changes were produced in the stress and strain to break using11 turns/cm. However, large changes were produced in the Hookean (decrease inModulus) and yield regions (increase in Modulus). Extensive changes were pro-
duced in all stress strain parameters while simultaneously twisting at higher levels(23 and 38 turns/cm). These scientists concluded that the combination of tensile andtorsion stresses (at these twist levels) weakens human hair ﬁbers, but these levels oftwist are far beyond what is normally encountered in actual practice on live heads.The degree of recovery from twist deformation was examined after the ﬁberswere relaxed for 5–10 min before stretching. Dankovich et al. [ 43] concluded thatthe tensile properties of human hair are recoverable from twist deformations at lowand moderate twist levels as normally encountered in routine grooming operations.When the ﬁbers were twisted and then allowed to untwist the tensile stress andstrain did not change relative to controls, however, the initial modulus decreasedwith increasing levels of twist [ 43].By examining scanning electron micrographs Dankovich et al. [ 43] found that
twisting and untwisting hairs can produce cuticular damage which doesn’t show up550 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
in tensile testing. This result supports the conclusion of Robbins and Crawford [ 7]that tensile properties are a property of the cortex with negligible contribution fromthe cuticle. When a highly elliptical hair is twisted (even at low twist) the cuticlecells are compressed into one another creating damage to the scales, see Fig. 9.9.This scale damage does not occur to the same degree in more circular hair ﬁbers(because of less scale overlap). The effect of twisting hairs and hair damage isdescribed in more detail later in this chapter. The above experiments involved theeffects of twisting hairs on the tensile properties, and not effects of natural twists onthe extension behavior as examined by Kamath et al. [ 19] and described later in thischapter.9.2.6 Tensile Properties of Different Geo-Racial GroupsData from six different laboratories was compiled comparing the breaking stress forboth Caucasian and African type hair at 65% RH and room temperature [ 19,44,
45]. The average breaking stress for Caucasian hair was 187 MPa. The average forFig. 9.9 Results of twisting ahighly elliptical hair ﬁber[43].Top: Note damaged“line” where cuticle scalesconverge upon twisting.Bottom : Note the damageeffect at higher magniﬁcation(reprinted with permission ofthe Journal of CosmeticScience)9.2 Tensile Extension and Deformations 551
African hair was 151 MPa. These data as analyzed by the matched pairs t-test weresigniﬁcantly different showing that African type hair requires a lower stress tobreak than Caucasian hair. Unfortunately insufﬁcient experimental details weredescribed in some of these studies to determine the length of the ﬁbers tested, theposition on the scalp and age/weathering, and whether or not data for some hairswere rejected for breaking before entering the post yield region.Relevant to these points is the fact that Duvel et al. [ 46] on Caucasian hairshowed about an 8% loss in the tip ends of 41 cm hair ﬁbers for the tensile breakingstress. This tensile loss could not be detected at 16 cm from the scalp end, but wasdetected between 16 and 24 cm from the scalp end (about 1 and 1/2 year’s growth).These scientists also found a gradual loss of both covalently bound lipid and freelipid from the hair. Duvel et al. proposed that this ongoing loss of both free and
covalently bound lipid by weathering actions leads to an increased susceptibility ofthe proteins of the cortex to degradation and eventually to a loss in the tensilebreaking stress. Regrettably, data of this sort was not found for curly African typehair where weathering including grooming actions leads to small cracks in the hair[19] and appears to be more severe. However, long African hair is difﬁcult to obtainfor such a comparison because of its fragility.Kamath et al. [ 19] demonstrated on African American hair (chemically untreatedand not treated with hot irons) from one male that the breaking stress was very lowat 123 MPa (ellipticity 1.89; indicative of a very high curvature probably Type VIII[47]). These scientists compared this hair to their earlier work on Caucasian hair[18] (also at 65% RH and room temperature) where the breaking stress was found to
be approximately 200 MPa (pooled European dark brown hair, average ellipticity1.17) to 220 MPa (highly elliptical, index ¼1.6 Caucasian hair from one individ-ual). Kamath, Hornby and Weigmann demonstrated that the African type hair hadtwists and at 65% RH, 22% of the ﬁbers broke before 20% extension. When this“premature failure” occurred, Kamath, Hornby and Weigmann observed that theﬁbers often broke in a region of ﬁber twist. This effect was conﬁrmed by examina-tion of the broken ends of the hairs, see Fig. 9.10. Furthermore, Kamath, Hornbyand Weigmann found that the cross-sectional area varied widely in the region oftwist, see Fig. 9.11.Kamath, Hornby and Weigmann found “premature failure” to be more prevalentin the dry state than the wet state (in fact it was virtually non-existent in the wetstate) and concluded that premature failure was due to natural structural ﬂaws in thetwists of the ﬁbers or ﬂaws produced by mechanical damage associated with
grooming actions. Of the seven hair types that Hardy [ 48] examined, he noted thehighest frequency of kinks or twists in the most highly coiled hair with the mostfrom African type hair.Pili torti (Fig. 9.12, also see Chap. 3) is a congenital deformity resulting in highlytwisted hair ﬁbers and can be confused with highly twisted African hair, but it iseven more twisted than kinky hair of Africans. In this disease, hair ﬁbers oftenbreak in a twisted region only a short distance from the scalp because of defectscreated by natural twists in the ﬁbers. The susceptibility of highly twisted Pili tortihair ﬁbers to breakage supports the work and conclusions of Kamath et al. [ 19]552 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers

showing that premature fractures and breakage of hair ﬁbers of African type hairoccur in the region of natural twists.Porter et al. [ 47] found that the tensile properties of African hair (curl Type IV toVIII) for more than 12,000 hair ﬁbers (65% RH) tends to decrease with increasingﬁber curvature, R2¼0.66. Therefore, for African type hair 66% of the variation inbreaking stress, a decrease from 206 to 173 MPa from curl Type IV to curl TypeVIII can be accounted for by hair ﬁber curvature or effects associated withcurvature such as twists or kinks, ﬁber composition and/or mechanical damage
from grooming conditions. Porter et al. indicated that in their work, tensileproperties were measured on the ﬁrst 50 hairs that showed “normal failure proﬁles”.This suggests that data from those hair ﬁbers that displayed “premature failure”were rejected providing higher values for the breaking stress in Porter’s work thanin some of the other studies such as the study by Kamath et al. [ 19] or even for somecomparisons with data for Caucasian or Asian hair.The breaking stress for chemically untreated Caucasian hair ﬁbers at 65%RH from 11 different laboratories/scientists [ 10,18,43–45,49–51] averages197/C615.8 MPa with an upper 95% mean of 207.6 and a lower 95% mean of186.4 MPa. A similar distribution analysis of African hair for breaking stress fromseven different laboratories [ 19,44,45,47] over the curl range of IV to VIII shows amean of 156.6 /C631.7 with an upper 95% mean of 185.9 and a lower 95% mean of
127.4 MPa suggesting a lower mean and more variation for the African hair data.Unfortunately we do not know with certainty the curl type range covered by theCaucasian hair in these studies, but it likely covers curl Types I to III and possibly Ito IV. Therefore, these data suggest a larger effect of curvature on breaking stressover the curvature range of curl Type VI to VIII for African type hair than forCaucasian hair over the curvature range of curl Type I to III or IV which is mostlikely from weakening of the ﬁbers from higher grooming forces for the highercurvature hair. In addition a correspondingly higher ellipticity range [ 47] shouldresult in more and larger twists which would produce more natural ﬂaws andweaker ﬁbers.Fig. 9.12 Pili Torti ortwisted hair, an example of acongenital deformity in whichan extremely twisted hair isproduced and it tends to breakeasily in the regions of twists(also see Fig. 3.3).

The breaking stress from three different laboratories which directly comparedAsian versus Caucasian hair averaged 191.1 MPa for Asian and 191.8 for Caucasianhair at 65% RH and room temperature, thus no signiﬁcant difference. One of thesestudies compared 50 hairs from each geo-racial group (TRI-Princeton was thetesting lab) while the number of hairs in the other two studies were not speciﬁed[45]. These data suggested no signiﬁcant difference in the breaking stress of Asianversus Caucasian hair; however because of the larger diameter and lower ellipticityof Asian hair I would recommend additional study with many more hairs over allrelevant curvatures for these two hair types before this conclusion is accepted.Porter et al. [ 47] showed that for 12,050 African type hair ﬁbers, Young’smodulus decreases with increasing ﬁber curvature from 3,147 MPa for curl classIV to 2,670 MPa for curl class VIII. Young’s modulus for Caucasian hair from
seven different laboratories [ 10,18,43,49–51] was compiled and a distributionanalysis showed an average of 3,478 MPa with an upper 95% mean of 3,859 and alower 95% mean of 3,098 MPa. Therefore, Young’s modulus for stretching Cauca-sian hair (about 1–2% stretch) tends to be higher than for “average” African typehair. Whether or not Young’s modulus for African hair of curl class IV is equivalentto that of Caucasian hair or other curl class IV hair will require direct testing.Scott and Robbins [ 49] found no signiﬁcant difference between Young’s modu-lus for stretching Korean hair versus Caucasian hair, but this was on a limitednumber of ﬁbers (25 from each group). In theory if the internal structures of Asianand Caucasian hairs are sufﬁciently similar we would expect the same Young’smodulus for these two hair types.9.2.7 Chemical Bleaching of Hair and Tensile PropertiesChapter 5describes the chemistry of bleaching human hair. A major side reaction in
the bleaching of hair involves the oxidation of cystine cross-links to cysteic acidresidues. This disruption of disulﬁde cross-links in the cortex has a major inﬂuenceon the wet tensile properties of hair. Alexander et al. [ 52] oxidized wool ﬁbers todifferent extents with peracetic acid and determined the work required to stretch theﬁbers, both wet and dry, and the cystine contents of the ﬁbers. They concluded thatthe disulﬁde bonds contribute largely to the wet breaking stress of the ﬁbers.Furthermore, the wet breaking stress decreased almost linearly with the cystinecontent. In contrast, the dry breaking stress was virtually unaffected by disulﬁdebond rupture. In fact, Alexander et al. [ 53] found a weakening in the dry state onlyafter more than 60% of the cystine cross-links were broken.Harris and Brown [ 54] reduced wool ﬁbers to different extents and methylated
the newly formed thiol groups to prevent recombination to disulﬁde bonds.These scientists then determined changes in the 30% index of these ﬁbers. Theirconclusions were much the same as those of Alexander et al. [ 53], that is the wetbreaking stress decreased with the cystine content but the dry breaking stress wasvirtually unaffected by cystine content except at high percentage rupture. Garson9.2 Tensile Extension and Deformations 555
et al. [ 55] measured the dynamic elastic properties of hair ﬁbers. They found similareffects. These scientists found that the effects of oxidation are greater whenmeasurements are made in water than at relative humidity ranging from 0% to 80%.Oxidative bleaching of human hair on live heads provides similar results for thetensile properties. Robbins and Kelly [ 56] examined both the wet and dry tensileproperties of frosted and non-frosted hair ﬁbers from the same person (Table 9.3)that is hair that had been frosted on the head. Except for the resilience ratio, the lossin dry tensile properties was less than 10%, but the loss in wet tensile propertiesapproached 60% at 48% disulﬁde cleavage. Therefore, these results are similar tothe oxidation of wool ﬁber by Alexander et al. [ 53].Alexander et al. [ 53] also suggested that both the dry and wet breaking stress of
wool ﬁbers are greatly inﬂuenced by peptide bond cleavage, but cleavage of thedisulﬁde bond primarily affects the wet breaking stress. This effect likely occurs bybreaking of crosslinks in the ﬁber and an increase in the water binding capacity ofthe ﬁbers in critical regions of the cortex. The frosting treatment is an alkalineperoxide-persulfate system capable of some peptide bond cleavage, which likelyaccounts for the small losses in dry breaking stress. Peptide bond cleavage alsolikely accounts for the difference between the percentage decrease in cystine andthe percentage loss in wet tensile properties.Interestingly, the percentage change in the dry resilience ratio, an estimate of theability of the ﬁbers to recover from extension into the yield region, approximatesthe loss of cystine cross-links. Additional work is necessary to determine the
signiﬁcance of this observation. The above discussion suggests that the percentageloss in cystine, as estimated by cystine or cysteic acid analysis, is a good estimate ofthe loss in tensile properties of hair bleached by current “in use” treatments.Since frosting of hair is an extreme bleaching treatment, an obvious question isto what extent milder bleaching treatments affect the tensile properties of hair.Several papers [ 56–58] describe bleach damage to hair either by cystine or cysteicTable 9.3 Tensile properties of frosted hairaTensile parameter NonfrostedhairFrostedhair% loss in tensileproperty% loss incystineWet tensile propertiesWork to extend 20% 13.34 5.50 59 48Hookean slope 13.25 5.79 56 48Hookean limit 13.30 5.19 61 48Force to extend 20% 16.67 7.01 58 48Resilience ratio 0.587 0.585 0 48Dry (55% RH) tensile propertiesWork to extend 20% 32.06 30.84 4 48Force to extend 20% 36.71 33.80 8 48Resilience ratio 0.173 0.115 44 48

acid analyses [ 57] or by tensile properties [ 31,58,59]. In summary, these paperssuggest that “in use” bleaching of hair commonly produces decreases in the wettensile properties of up to 25%, with greater losses occurring when the ﬁbers arefrosted or stripped and in many cases of “in use” bleaching the changes in the drytensile properties are very small and close to the limits of detection.9.2.8 Permanent Waving Hair and Tensile PropertiesChapter 4describes the chemistry of the reactions of permanent waves with humanhair. Permanent waving involves reduction of disulﬁde cross-links accompanied bymolecular shifting of proteins by bending the hair on rollers followed by mild re-oxidation. These reactions produce large changes to the tensile properties of theﬁbers during reduction but smaller changes after re-oxidation.Data by Crawford (private communication) (see Table 9.4), using hair waved in
the laboratory with a commercial home permanent at a 4:1 solution-to-hair ratio andthen re-oxidized, showed a decrease in the tensile properties of approximately5–20%. Beyak et al. [ 31] conﬁrmed this ﬁnding for the wet tensile properties ofpermanent waved hair. This amount of tensile damage appears to be typical for a“normal” permanent-wave treatment, where approximately 20% of the disulﬁdebonds are ruptured during the reduction step [ 56]. Other reports in the literature, forexample the paper by Tate et al. [ 60] show larger decreases in the wet tensileproperties from permanent waving. Such effects are most likely from laboratorypermanent waving as opposed to on head treatment and lab tests often involve alarger than “in use” solution to hair ratio.Higher concentrations of mercaptan, higher pH [ 61], and higher solution-to-hairratios all produce more extensive reduction [ 59,62] and ultimately more tensile
damage. The decrease in dry tensile properties is less than in the wet state. This is inagreement with the work of Harris and Brown [ 54], who showed that up to 60%elimination of disulﬁde bonds in keratin ﬁbers, by reduction and methylation,produces only small effects on the dry tensile properties (65% RH). However, thewet tensile properties decrease almost linearly with the disulﬁde content.Garson et al. [ 55] measured the dynamic elastic properties of hair and demon-strated that permanent-waving, similar to bleaching, provides greater changes to theelastic properties of hair in water than at relative humidity from 0% to 80%.Table 9.4 Effect of permanent waving on the tensile properties of human hair (Crawford, privatecommunication)Stress to break Stress to extend 20%Dry (65% RH) Wet Dry (65% RH) WetCommercial homePermanent wave /C07% /C015% /C011% /C018%9.2 Tensile Extension and Deformations 557
Presumably, certain hydrogen bonds are inaccessible to water in “virgin” hair.However, elimination of speciﬁc disulﬁde bonds by oxidation and/or permanent-waving renders these additional hydrogen bonds accessible to liquid water or evenat high regains (over 80% RH). Therefore, under these conditions those bonds arebroken by water thus lowering the wet tensile properties more than the dry tensileproperties.Stretching hair ﬁbers in aqueous solutions of reducing agents, compared towater, results in lower required stresses to achieve a given strain (see Fig. 9.13).This effect is due to the rupture of disulﬁde bonds, the breaking of hydrogen bonds,and molecular reorientation. Treatment of reduced hair with mild oxidizing agents(neutralization) increases the tensile properties, approaching the properties of theoriginal untreated ﬁbers. Such occurs if the ﬁbers have not been reduced toodrastically (beyond 30–50% disulﬁde rupture).
Load-elongation [ 63] and stress-relaxation [ 64] measurements may be used tofollow the course of the reduction of keratin ﬁbers by mercaptans. Extension intothe post yield region is resisted primarily by the disulﬁde bonds [ 63], which is onereason that this region of the stress/strain curve holds special signiﬁcance to thereduction reaction. However, Wortmann and Souren [ 65] pointed out that the maineffect of reduction or the cleavage of disulﬁde bonds may be on the crystallineﬁlaments. More speciﬁcally, the effect is likely on the interactions between thecrystalline and surrounding structures rather than on the disulﬁde bonds themselves.Thus, the wet tensile properties serve as a valuable tool for studying the reduction ofhair [ 61–66] its re-oxidation [ 63,67], and the effects of the total cold-wave process[31,58].Fig. 9.13 Schematic diagram representing stress/strain curves for a hair ﬁber in reducing solution
compared to a hair in water558 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
9.2.9 Alkaline Straightening and Tensile PropertiesAlkaline straightening degrades both cystine and peptide bonds. Therefore, alkalinestraightening must decrease both the wet and dry tensile properties of human hair.Nevertheless, I have not been able to ﬁnd data in the literature to support this ratherobvious conclusion. Data from Kamath et al. [ 15] demonstrated by fatiguingexperiments that hair is weakened by alkaline straightening treatments. The hairused in this study was from a Black male age 31. This hair had never been treatedwith chemical or heat treatments. Both an alkaline and reduction type relaxer wasshown to weaken the hair. With the alkaline straightener 8% of the ﬁbers brokeduring treatment. In comparison, for the thioglycolate reduction treatment zeroﬁbers broke during treatment. This effect shows more damage by the alkalinestraightener in spite of the fact that a chemical neutralizer was not used after thereduction treatment by the thioglycolate system.
The fatiguing process involves attaching weights to the ﬁbers and then droppingthe weights repeatedly to stress the hair similar to the way it might be fatiguedby continuous combing of the ﬁbers. The data shows the largest distinction betweenuntreated and treated ﬁbers using the smaller rather than the larger weights.Therefore, the data (with smaller weights) are probably the most meaningfulindicator of damage to the hair. These data clearly show that the hair is weakenedor damaged by both treatments; however, more damage is indicated by the alkalinestraightener than by the thiol type relaxer [ 15].9.2.10 Dyes and Surfactants and Tensile PropertiesChapter 7describes the chemistry of oxidation a nd ionic dyes in detail. Oxidationdyes are by far the most prevalent hair dyes, and consist of aromatic amines andphenols [ 68–70] that condense with each other and possibly with electron-richside chain groups in hair. Oxidative dyeing is done in the presence of an oxidizing
agent such as hydrogen peroxide at a pH of up to 10. The concentration ofperoxide and alkali required depends on the difference bet ween the startinghair color and the desired shade. Theref ore, the primary tensile damage to hairby oxidation dyes depends on the extent of accompanying disulﬁde oxidation(bleaching) that occurs in the cortex of the hair. In theory, dyeing hair from adarker to a lighter shade should produce more wet tensile damage than dying hairfrom a lighter to a darker shade; however th e more important factor is the extent ofoxidation that occurs to the hair proteins in the cortex regardless of the shadedifference.Crawford (private communication) found small losses in tensile properties inhair dyed from a lighter to a darker shade with a commercial oxidation dye. Pandeet al. [ 71] found 5–8% loss in the wet tensile properties (to 15% extension) for
Permanent hair dyes and 2–6% loss for Demipermanent dyes. Pande et al. also9.2 Tensile Extension and Deformations 559
found that hair dyes provide protection from oxidative sun damage. In addition, thedarker the dyes the more sun protection provided.The tensile damage to hair by anionic and cationic surfactants or dyes in singletreatments that is by short time intervals (hours) and moderate pH’s is negligible.Zahn [ 72] examined the effect of anionic and cationic surfactants on the 25% indexof wool and hair. Soaking wool ﬁbers in sodium dodecyl sulfate for 7–41 daysproduced a decrease of only 6% in the 25% index. Shorter time intervals producedeven less wet tensile damage. Zahn [ 72] indicated that for human hair the decreaseis approximately one-half that of wool ﬁber, and these effects are reversible withwater. Zahn indicated slightly larger effects from cationic surfactants. Scott (privatecommunication) examined the stress/strain properties of hair after treatment with acationic surfactant and found negligible changes. These results test the effects of
surfactants on “chemically unaltered” hair, in single treatments, with no mechanicalstresses applied. Interactions with other treatments were not considered.Robbins and Reich, in unpublished work, conducted experiments showing thatsurfactants and mechanical stresses in combination (short-term treatments (min)attempting to simulate “in use” conditions) can damage the cuticle. But, damage toonly the cuticle will not be demonstrable through changes in the tensile properties, aprimary weakness of this type of test procedure.Duvel et al. [ 46] cut long Caucasian hair into ﬁve sections from root to tip end
and extracted and analyzed these sections by thin layer chromatography. Thesescientists showed three classes of major polar lipids including ceramides, glucosyl-ceramides and cholesterol sulfate. In addition, they found as expected that theconcentrations of all of these lipids as well as covalently bonded fatty acidsdecreased with increasing distance from the root end. The data on tensile propertiesalso decreased as one moved from root to tip end. These scientists concluded thatthe progressive loss of structural hair lipids is a result of normal weathering of hairand grooming actions. Thus, weathering and grooming may help in some manner tocontribute to the decrease in the tensile properties of the hair rather than to attributethe decrease in tensile properties to the loss of hair lipids alone.9.2.11 pH and Tensile PropertiesSpeakman and Scott [ 73] found that the inﬂuence of pH on the tensile properties of
human hair parallel the effects of swelling and pH on wool ﬁber. Valko and Barnett[74] showed that hair displays a minimum in swelling from pH 2 to 9 with a slightincrease in swelling below pH 2 and a larger increase in swelling above pH 9, usingextended soaking times (Fig. 9.14).Breuer and Prichard [ 75] determined that when human hair is exposed overnightto solutions with pH values <2, it undergoes irreversible structural changes pro-ducing a decrease of up to 30% in the 20% index. Hydrolysis and structuralrearrangements most likely occur from such a harsh acid treatment.560 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
9.2.12 Light Radiation and Tensile PropertiesSunlight and ultraviolet light have been shown to decrease the 15% index (indistilled water). Beyak [ 76] related this effect to the total radiation on the hair.These ﬁndings were interpreted as photochemical degradation of disulﬁde bondsand have been conﬁrmed by Robbins and Kelly [ 77]. These scientists analyzedamino acids of both proximal and distal ends of human hair and found a signiﬁ-cantly larger amount of cysteic acid and a signiﬁcantly smaller amount of cystine indistal ends. Harris and Smith [ 78] provided evidence for ultraviolet disruption ofcystine in wool ﬁber. Dubief [ 79] used the 15% index to follow changes induced inhair using different radiation sources and found about a 40% decrease in the 15%index after 3 months of summer sun exposure on a Paris rooftop. This effect
calculates to about a 3 month Florida sun exposure of UV radiation for 24 h perday. See Chap. 5for a discussion of the chemistry of these reactions and Chap. 10on hair breakage.Changes in the cuticle–cuticle CMC such as oxidation of the tertiary hydrogenatoms of 18-MEA has also been reported by Korner et al. [ 80] however suchchanges to the cuticle-cuticle CMC will not show up in tensile testing.9.2.13 Hair Abnormalities and Tensile PropertiesKorastoff [ 81] examined human hair from patients with hypothyroidism and acro-megaly and showed a characteristic alteration in the yield region of the stress/straincurve (at low humidity) compared to hair from control groups. Swanbeck [ 82]Fig. 9.14 Swelling of hair and changes with pH9.2 Tensile Extension and Deformations 561
determined that patients suffering from congenital ectodermal dysplasia have hairof low tensile breaking force.Monilethrix is a genetic anomaly in whi ch hair ﬁbers contain periodic con-strictions along the ﬁber axis (see Chap. 3). Wilson [ 83] demonstrated thatmonilethrix hairs tend to fracture at thes e constrictions and therefore I concludemust exhibit abnormal stretching behavior. Trichorrhexis nodosa is anotherabnormal condition, wherein hair ﬁbers contain nodes at irregular intervalsalong the ﬁber axis (see Chap. 3). These nodes actually contain tiny fracturesa n dt h eﬁ b e r st e n dt of o r mb r o o m - l i k eb r e a k s[ 83] under stress. Therefore, nodosahair ﬁbers should also exhibit abnormal stretching behavior with prematurefailure at low strain levels. Pili torti i s another congenital deformity in whichsevere twists occur in the ﬁbers resulting i n hair ﬁbers that break easily. Therefore
Pili torti hair must exhibit weak tensile be havior. Other hair shaft anomalies suchas trichothiodystrophy and Menkes sy ndrome should also display abnormalstretching behavior consistent with the a bnormal hair shaft condition associatedwith these diseases, see Chap. 3.9.2.14 Reductive Polymerization in Hair and Metal Saltsand Tensile PropertiesAnzuino and Robbins [ 84] carried out in situ polymerizations of vinyl monomers inhuman hair. These scientists then studied the reactions of the polymer-containinghair with metal salts via wet load-extension testing. This reductive polymeriza-tion reaction decreased the wet tensile properties by approximately 15%. Thesescientists found that mercuric acetate tre atment of hair containing polydimethy-laminoethyl methacrylate, polyacryloni trile, and polyethylene glycol mono-
methacrylate were the most effective systems for increasing wet load–extensionproperties. Although cross-linking through metallic bonding was proposed, analternative mechanism involves reducing the water binding capacity of the ﬁbersby the polymer and metal taking up space that could be occupied by water in criticalwater binding regions of the cortex.9.3 Other Approaches to Evaluate Stretching Properties of HairSeveral other approaches have been used for studying the stretching properties ofhuman hair. Among these approaches are vibration methods [ 10,11], stress relaxa-tion [ 64], stretch rotation [ 85], set and supercontraction [ 27], fatiguing [ 15] andextension cycling [ 16]. Several of these approaches will be described in some of thenext sections of this chapter.562 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
9.3.1 Vibration MethodsIn this scheme, a ﬁber is attached to a beam with a known natural resonant frequency.Tension (within the Hookean region) is applied to the ﬁber. The beam is thendeﬂected, and, from the change in the oscillation frequency of the beam with theﬁber attached, and the natural resonant frequency of the freely vibrating beam, onecan calculate the elastic modulus of the ﬁber. Huck and Baddiel [ 11] and Garson et al.[55] used this type of system to evaluate the elastic properties of human hair ﬁbers.Huck and Baddiel attached both ends of hair ﬁbers to an oscillating beam. This set upcontained a third point of attachment in the middle of the ﬁber for applying tension.From the following expression, they calculated the elastic modulus:ES¼8Q2IL B2/C0B2o/C0/C1AZ L2B¼the oscillation frequency with the ﬁber in position, B o¼the natural resonantfrequency of the beam, L ¼the ﬁber length, I ¼the moment of inertia of the beam,
A¼the ﬁber cross-sectional area, and Z ¼the distance between the ﬁber ends.The elastic modulus by this “dynamic” method is slightly higher than by loadextension, a “quasi-static” method. Tests involving elastic deformations, whereeither stress or strain is held constant, are called static tests. In quasi-static tests,stress or strain is changed slowly with time, and in dynamic tests, stress and/orstrain are varied rapidly with time.9.3.2 Stress RelaxationStress relaxation is a technique in which the ﬁber is stretched to a given length,treated, and maintained at the stretched length while the decaying stresses arefollowed with time. Kubu and Montgomery [ 64] used this technique to follow thekinetics of the reduction of wool ﬁber. Robinson and Rigby [ 86]e x a m i n e db o t hw o o land human hair ﬁber by stress relaxation. These scientists found differences along the
axis of the ﬁbers which they attributed to a decreasing free mercaptan level furtherfrom the root. This effect provides for less disulﬁde-mercaptan interchange and aslower rate of stress relaxation as the distance increases from the scalp.9.3.3 Stretch RotationHirsch [ 85] studied the elongation of hair under a steadily increasing load, togetherwith a rotational movement. He attempted to explain this combination of stretchingand torsion in terms of molecular structure. See the section on the torsionalproperties of hair in this chapter.9.3 Other Approaches to Evaluate Stretching Properties of Hair 563
9.3.4 Set and SupercontractionBrown et al. [ 87] deﬁned set as a treatment that enables a keratin ﬁber to maintain alength greater than its original length. Chapter 4describes setting as it relates to thecold-waving or permanent wave process. Supercontraction is not a stretchingphenomenon. It is the condition in which a keratin ﬁber is ﬁxed (by treatment) orheld at a length less than its original length. Supercontraction is related mechanisti-cally to setting and is also described in Chap. 4.9.4 Bending and Fiber StiffnessWhen a ﬁber is bent (see Fig. 9.15), the outer layers of the arc of the bent hair (A)are stretched, and the inner layers (C) are compressed. A region in the center, theneutral plane (B), is unchanged in length. Stiffness is simply the resistance tobending and is an important fundamental ﬁber property [ 88]. Recent evidenceshows that bending stiffness of single hairs is very important to hair handle orFig. 9.15 Schematic diagram

feel, to combing forces and to hair breakage. See the section near the end ofChap. 10for details.9.4.1 Bending MethodsSeveral methods have been described for measuring the bending properties of hairﬁbers. For human hair, the balanced ﬁber method of Scott and Robbins [ 49,89]appears to be the easiest to handle experimentally (except for very curly hair). Thismethod provides less scatter (lower variances) than the other methods [ 49]. How-ever, this method is only applicable to hair ﬁbers of curvature Types I and II andpossibly some of Type III, but not hairs with higher curvatures.A newer method developed by Baltenneck et al. [ 90] involves a bendingpendulum of parallel hair ﬁbers. This method also appears to offer promise fordetermining the bending properties of hair ﬁbers [ 90]. Baltenneck’s method mostlikely could be used with hairs with higher degrees of curvature than the Scott andRobbins method.
The vibrating-reed method (oscillating ﬁber cantilever) has also been used withhuman hair [ 10]. The cantilever beam method [ 89], the loop deformation method[91], and the center load beam method [ 92] have also been described for textileﬁbers.The method of Scott and Robbins involves attaching small equal weights to eachend of the ﬁber. Each end of the ﬁber is individually threaded through a short lengthof plastic tubing. A tapered metal pen is inserted in the other end of the tube (thecombined weight of pin and tube is known). The ﬁber is then hung over a ﬁne wirehook and the distance d between the two vertical legs of the hanging ﬁber ismeasured (see Fig. 9.15).The distance d is an index of stiffness of the ﬁber. The stiffness coefﬁcient G(ratio of applied force to bending deﬂection) may be calculated from d using thisexpression:G¼Td2=8T is the force applied to each ﬁber leg in dynes (g /C2980.6 cm/s2).The elastic modulus for bending E Bmay also be calculated from d:
EB¼QTd22A2A is the ﬁber cross-sectional area, determined from diameter or linear densitymeasurements.Scott developed an equation that describes the hanging ﬁber shape by conven-tional X, Y coordinates and the d measurement. We have veriﬁed this equation by9.4 Bending and Fiber Stiffness 565
showing that calculated ﬁber shapes are exactly superimposable on those ofenlarged photographs of actual balanced hanging ﬁbers (see Fig. 9.15).The bending modulus E Bby this method at 62% RH and 75/C14F is approximatelyequal to Young’s modulus for stretching (E s) determined under similar experimen-tal conditions by the load–extension method, E B¼3.79/C21010dynes/cm2or3,790 MPa. These values have not been corrected for ﬁber ellipticity. Such acorrection may be considered academic, but it should make EBslightly higherthan E sfor human hair, because elliptical ﬁbers orient to bend over their minor axisin this method.Simpson’s [ 10] values of E Bfor human hair were higher 5.35 /C21010dynes/cm2or 5,350 MPa. However, Simpson used the vibrating cantilever method. Thisprocedure produces E Bvalues that vary with vibration frequency. Simpson alsoused a lower RH (50%).The stiffness index of hair ﬁbers by the method of Scott and Robbins provides
falling curves when plotted against weight attached to the ﬁbers. Routinemeasurements are made at 0.2 g total weight (0.1 g per ﬁber leg), and with a wirehook of 0.77 mm diameter (0.19–1.28 mm). For ﬁne ﬁbers, <50mm in diameter,smaller weights (0.05 g per ﬁber leg) are recommended. (For additional details, seereferences 49,89.)9.4.2 Stiffness and Linear DensityThe stiffness coefﬁcient is directly proportional to ﬁber linear density. The dataplotted in Fig. 9.16 provide an index of determination of 0.94 [ 49] demonstratingthat 94% of the variation in stiffness (in this experiment) is accounted for byFig. 9.16 Hair ﬁber stiffness index and linear density [ 49] (reprinted with permission of theJournal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists)566 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
variation in linear density. Therefore, consistent with theory, stiffness increaseswith ﬁber diameter. Theory predicts a fourth power dependence between ﬁberstiffness and diameter for a perfectly elastic system.9.4.3 Stiffness and Relative HumidityAs one might anticipate, hair ﬁber stiffness also varies with RH. It decreases withincreasing RH as shown by the Scott and Robbins method (see Fig. 9.17). We mightconclude that hair ﬁber stiffness generally parallels ﬁber-stretching properties withrespect to treatments. This conclusion is probably correct in most instances.As indicated above, a novel approach to determining the bending properties ofhair ﬁbers was published by Baltenneck et al. [ 90] in which a bending pendulum
composed of 39 parallel hair ﬁbers, each 11 mm long and spaced 1 mm apart areﬁxed on a metallic support. The pendulum is then set into motion and the hairbending stiffness is assessed by the number of strokes observed until the pendulumstops. The data from this method on the effects of RH on bending stiffness agreeswith that of Scott and Robbins [ 49], that is, the bending properties of hair decreasewith increasing RH.9.4.4 Bending Stiffness and Hair DamageBaltenneck et al. [ 90] examined the bending properties of virgin and chemicallydamaged hair ﬁbers. Their results show that virgin hair is less stiff than eitherFig. 9.17 Hair ﬁber stiffness versus relative humidity [ 49] (reprinted with permission of theJournal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists)9.4 Bending and Fiber Stiffness 567
bleached (peroxide/persulfate bleach for 50 min) for most dry state conditions(20–80% RH). But, virgin hair is stiffer than permanent waved hair at 100% RH.Surprisingly, bleached hair did not show a difference in stiffness from virgin hair at100% RH. This latter result is not consistent with results of Scott and Robbins.9.4.5 Bending Stiffness and Hair Fiber CurvatureElliptical ﬁbers bend over their minor axis and most human hair ﬁbers are ellipticalrather than circular. Nagase et al. [ 93] found a statistically signiﬁcant correlation ofcurl radius (Curl types I to IV) with ellipticity among hair from 132 Japanesewomen. However the index of determination was only 0.06 meaning that theellipticity decreases only very slightly as the curl increases for relatively straight
hair, that is only 6% of the variation in ellipticity could be explained by the curlradius. Therefore, from ellipticity effects alone, we would not expect a meaningfulimpact of hair ﬁber curvature on the bending properties of Asian type hair over therange of curvatures from Curl type I to IV. No large studies were found comparingcurvature and ellipticity for Caucasian hair over Curl types I to IV.However, African type hair is different. Porter et al. [ 47], from data on 12,050hair ﬁbers, found that African type hair becomes more elliptical with increasinghair ﬁber curvature (R2¼0.947). Therefore, 95% of the variation of ellipticity inAfrican type hair can be explained by hair ﬁber curvature for curly hair. In addition,Porter et al. demonstrated that the cross-sectional area of African hair decreaseswith increasing ﬁber curvature. Elliptical ratios above 1.6 are common for Africanhair [ 47]. Therefore, other variables being equal we would expect the bending
stiffness index to decrease with increasing hair ﬁber curvature for African type hairover the curvature range of curl types IV to VIII.In contrast to the bending stiffness index, the bending modulus is a constant,calculated by dividing by the 4th power of the ﬁber diameter (diameter of minoraxis). As indicated earlier, we know from work by Thibaut et al. [ 94] that the IF’sand KAP’s of the cortex of human hair become more asymmetrically distributedwith increasing ﬁber curvature for African [ 94], Caucasian [ 94] and Asian hair [ 95].This effect was demonstrated for Asian hair by Bryson et al. [ 95] resulting indifferent IF arrangements concentrated in the concave part of the curl versus theconvex part of a curl, see Chap. 1for details. Therefore the bending modulus shouldchange with increasing hair ﬁber curvature because of the changing arrangementsof these cortical structures with curvature.9.4.6 Bending and Possible Cuticle Contributions
9.4.6 Bending and Possible Cuticle ContributionsThere is evidence that the cuticle also plays a role in the bending properties ofkeratin ﬁbers as shown by Kawabata et al. [ 96] on wool ﬁber and by Masaaki [ 97],568 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
Swift [ 98] and by Atushi et al. [ 99] on human hair ﬁbers. Hadjur et al. [ 100]described a lack of symmetry in the number of cuticle cells near the minor axisversus the major axis of elliptical African hair ﬁbers. A lack of symmetry in thecuticle of curly African type hair ﬁbers versus greater symmetry for straighter hairof Asians and Caucasians should affect the bending and torsion properties. Never-theless, I have not been able to ﬁnd any studies relating hair ﬁber curvature to thebending properties of hair ﬁbers.9.5 Torsion and Fiber RigidityHair ﬁbers are routinely twisted during combing, brushing, and setting; however theextent of twist is relatively small compared to the twist required to break a ﬁber.The resistance to twisting is the torsional rigidity. By deﬁnition, rigidity is thetorque required to produce a twist of one turn per centimeter [ 91]. Rigidity in
twisting is analogous to stiffness in bending and is a fundamental property to hairﬁbers. Furthermore, torsion and ﬁber swelling methods measure stresses andtherefore bonding perpendicular to the ﬁber axis better than any other method.9.5.1 Torsion MethodsSeveral methods have been described for determining the torsional rigidity and thetorsional modulus (modulus of rigidity) of hair and/or textile ﬁbers [ 8,37,101–107].Basically, these methods are related to the torsion pendulum method [ 8,102,105,107]. The torsion pendulum method involves suspending a small pendulum from aﬁber. The ﬁber is then set into free rotational oscillation. By determining the period(P) of oscillation (time of vibration, which generally averages 10–20 completeoscillations), the ﬁber length (L), the ﬁber diameter (D), and the moment of inertiaof the pendulum (I), the torsional modulus ETmay be calculated.ET¼128PILP2D4The rigidity R (resistance to twisting) may be calculated from this expression:
R¼8P3IL=P2And the rigidity is related to its modulus by:ET¼R=JA29.5 Torsion and Fiber Rigidity 569
A is the ﬁber cross-sectional area and J is a shape factor, usually assumed to be 1for human hair and wool ﬁber.Another useful torsion parameter is the logarithmic decrement ( d). This param-eter describes the decay in amplitude of the untwisting pendulum with successiveoscillations:d¼ð1/nÞlnða1=anÞn¼the number of oscillations and a 1and a nare the amplitude of the ﬁrst and thenth oscillation. This logarithmic decrement is an indication of the torsional elastic-ity of the system. When d¼0, the ﬁber is perfectly elastic, and as dincreases theﬁber becomes less elastic. The logarithmic decrement is related to the torsional lossmodulus (ET’) in the following manner:ET0¼ETd=PA major drawback to the simple torsion pendulum method was that it could notbe used while the ﬁber is immersed in liquids because of the damping effect of theliquid. However, Wolfram and Albrecht [ 107] devised a very clever scheme to
overcome this obstacle by inserting the ﬁber into a small glass capillary tube, thuspermitting the torsional properties of hair ﬁbers (and other ﬁbers) to be measured inboth air and liquids. Other methods are available [ 103,104,108] for measurementof the rigidity of ﬁbers immersed in liquids. For additional details, see thereferences indicated and the texts by Meredith and Hearle [ 108] and Morton andHearle [ 92].9.5.2 Rigidity and MoistureThe torsional modulus for human hair by the pendulum method is lower than eitherthe stretching or the bending modulus at 60–65% RH. But more importantly, waterhas a greater effect on torsional properties than on either stretching or bending forboth human hair and wool ﬁber (see data describing these three different elasticmoduli: Tables 9.5and9.6).For wool ﬁber the effect of water on the torsional properties is almost 3–4 timesas great as on the bending or stretching properties, whereas for human hair theTable 9.5 Comparison of the
Table 9.5 Comparison of thestretching, bending, andtorsional moduli for humanhair at 60–65% RH [ 106](Scott, privatecommunication)ES EB ET3.89/C21010a3.79/C21010a0.89/C21010a3890b3790b890baThese values are dynes/cm2.EBand E Swere determined at 62%RH and room temperaturebThese values are in MPa570 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
effect is nearly a factor of 2 between 65% and 100% RH (see Table 9.6) and itshould be much greater from 0% to 100% RH.Wolfram and Albrecht [ 107] found that the logarithmic decrement varies withﬁber diameter. This parameter decreases with increasing ﬁber diameter in water,but it does not vary with diameter at 65% RH. This ﬁnding suggests that in water,the hair is less elastic or more plastic. These scientists implicate the cuticle asprimarily responsible for this increase in torsional plastic behavior for human hairin water and as shown later in this section; cuticle effects on the torsional behaviorof hair ﬁbers are measurable in contrast to tensile effects.9.5.3 Torsion and the Cuticle and Elliptical African HairMasaaki [ 97] examined the torsional modulus of rigidity on both intact hair and hair
in which the cuticle was removed by rubbing. His results demonstrated that thecuticle is about 3.5 times as rigid as the cortex. Therefore, the cuticle plays a majorrole in the twisting properties of human hair ﬁbers. These results are in agreementwith a similar study on wool ﬁber by Kawabata et al. [ 96] who examined thebending and shear properties of wool ﬁber in which the scales were removed bychlorine treatment. Kawabata et al. found that the shear modulus of wool withoutscales decreased signiﬁcantly, demonstrating that the cuticle does contribute toshearing effects in hair ﬁbers.Persaud and Kamath [ 8] demonstrated that the shea r modulus decreased withincreasing cross-sectional area for Eur opean dark brown hair. Since the ratio ofcuticle to cortex increases as hair become s ﬁner, these scientists concluded thatthe cuticle is highly involved in the torsio nal properties of hair ﬁbers. Since the
cuticle to cortex ratio also decreases as h air diameter increas es, these scientistsconclude that the rigidity of the cuticle dominates this measurement. Their dataalso showed a large increase in energy di ssipation for ﬁne to medium hairs aftersaturation with water and they concluded that the cuticle to cortex ratio plays lesso far o l ef o rac o a r s eﬁ b e r ’ se n e r g yd i s s i pation in the wet state. These authorsinterpreted this effect as a contributio n of the high cuticle to cortex ratio inlarge log decrement values for the ﬁne ﬁb ers versus the corresponding values at65% RH.Table 9.6 Inﬂuence of moisture on stretching, bending, and torsional moduliES EB ET0% RH/100% RH65% RH/100% RH0% RH/100% RH65% RH/100% RH0% RH/100% RH65% RH/100% RHHuman hair – 2.62 [ 30] 3.8a2.4a– 4.1 [ 103]Wool ﬁber 2.76 [ 25] 2.58 [ 33] – – 16.1 [ 33] 9.2 [ 33]aCalculated from unpublished data by Dr. G.V. Scott9.5 Torsion and Fiber Rigidity 571
As indicated, Dankovich et al. [ 43] demonstrated that twisting highly ellipticalhairs even at low twist levels produces cuticular damage with scales compressinginto one another from “tangential compression”. This cuticle damage was less inmore circular hairs. Since Porter et al. [ 47] showed that ellipticity increases withincreasing ﬁber curvature from Curl type VI to Curl type VIII (R2¼0.95), wewould expect that this type of cuticle damage from twisting will increase withincreasing ﬁber curvature for African type hair. African hair often contains naturaltwists; therefore, twisting hairs with natural twists should be even more compli-cated. Such an effect has not been reported in the literature.9.5.4 Torsional Behavior of Damaged HairBogaty [ 106] examined the torsional properties of permanent-waved and un-wavedhair. His results, summarized in Table 9.7, suggested that waved hair is more rigid
at low RH and less rigid above 90% RH than un-waved or virgin hair. Wolfram andAlbrecht [ 107] examined the torsional behavior of permanent-waved, bleached, anddyed hair. These scientists conﬁrmed the ﬁnding of Bogaty that permanent wavedhair (reduced hair) is less rigid than chemically unaltered hair in the dry state. Thesesame scientists also found that the rigidity ratio (Rwater/R65% RH ) is lower forbleached hair than for dyed hair, consistent with the greater amount of disulﬁdebond cleavage by bleaching as compared to permanent dyeing.If one takes ratios of the dry to wet torsional modulus in Table 9.7, it is apparentthat there is a greater effect of moisture on the torsional properties of waved hairthan on the torsional properties of chemically unaltered or virgin hair.The torsional behavior of hair, more than the tensile behavior, is dependent on
the cuticle or the external layers of the ﬁber because of greater shear forces in theperiphery versus the center of the ﬁber during twisting. Torsional behavior is alsomore sensitive to water than tensile properties. Permanent waves and bleaches dochange the torsional properties of hair, as demonstrated by Wolfram and Albrecht.Therefore, torsional methods should prove one day to be more sensitive to cuticledamage than current tensile methods.Persaud and Kamath [ 8] used their torsional pendulum method to examinedamaged hair and the performance of several hair care active ingredients includingTable 9.7 Torsional moduliof waved and un-waved hairfrom data of Bogaty [ 106]% RH Unwaved hair Waved hairMPa MPa41 1,190 1,25058 1,060 1,13065 890 99081 730 76093 420 400100 220 140572 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
a cationic surfactant, a conditioning polymer and hair spray ﬁlms. These scientistsalso used the elliptical cross-section of hairs instead of assuming circularity tocalculate torsional rigidity to reﬁne their torsional data. Persaud and Kamath foundthat the torsional properties of hairs treated with hair spray dissipate more energyversus un-treated hairs. Persaud and Kamath suggested that the hair spray polymeris softer than the cuticle and deforms more than the cuticle thus energy dissipationis higher for hair spray treated ﬁbers.Persaud and Kamath [ 8] also examined the effects of a cationic polymer(Polyquaternium-10) and of a cationic surfactant (Cetyl trimethyl ammoniumbromide) on bleached hair in this same study. Bleaching signiﬁcantly reduces theshear modulus at 65% RH due to oxidation of disulﬁde bonds to cysteic acid and thesubsequent additional water absorption in the hair (particularly in the rigid cuticle
layers and in the matrix of the cortex). Treatment of the bleached hair with thecationic polymer produced a small increase in the shear modulus and in the averagelog decrement values conﬁrming a detectable effect of ingredients on and in thesurface layers of the ﬁbers.Treatment of bleached hair with 0.5% of the cationic surfactant produced a largeincrease in the shear modulus and a signiﬁcant reduction in the average logdecrement values relative to the bleached controls. This stronger effect is probablydue to penetration of the surfactant into the cuticle layers and perhaps even into thecortex as opposed to the cationic polymer which is conﬁned more to the surface ofthe ﬁbers.Thus Persaud and Kamath [ 8] demonstrated the sensitivity of the torsional
method to all three of these hair treatments that act predominately on and in thecuticle; whereas tensile measurements did not show any signiﬁcant changes withthese same treatments conﬁrming that tensile properties are a property of the cortex[7] and that torsional measurements are more sensitive to effects on and in thecuticle and to effects involving changes in water content of the total ﬁber.9.5.5 Damage to Hair by TwistingTwisting hair and twisting and stretching hair is described in the section entitledTwisting and Stretching Normal Hair and Hair with Natural Twists in this chapter.9.6 Density of Hair (Mass/Volume)The density of human hair in solutions of benzene-carbon tetrachloride was deter-mined by the method of Abbott and Goodings [ 109]. The density of chemically
unaltered hair at 60% RH varied from 1.320 to 1.327, depending on lot (dark brownEuropean hair from DeMeo Bros., New York, and three samples taken from headsof volunteers). The density of our wool control was 1.320, identical with one lot of9.6 Density of Hair (Mass/Volume) 573
hair. Permanent waving did not change the density of hair. Bleaching (approxi-mately 25% disulﬁde rupture) increased it, but only by 0.45%.King [ 110] determined the density of wool ﬁber as a function of RH. Some ofKing’s results are summarized in Table 9.8. King’s data show that density changesare negligible for wool ﬁber from 15% to 85% RH or normal room humidity. Onewould expect the density versus RH relationship for wool and human hair to besimilar, since their densities at 60% RH and their moisture binding versus RHrelationships are virtually identical as demonstrated later in this chapter. Hearle andPeters [ 111] explained that the increase in ﬁber density with moisture regain from0% to 15% RH is contrary to expectations and is not fully understood.The objective of these density experiments was to determine the relative density
of human hair and wool ﬁber and the inﬂuence of damaging cosmetic treatments onthis important property. The results of these experiments conﬁrm the conclusions ofseveral others [ 91,112]: the densities of human hair and wool ﬁber are similar, andthere is no appreciable change in the density of human hair from permanent-wavingor bleaching treatments.9.7 Dimensions, Swelling and Effects of Fiber Shapeon ReactivityTwo of the most commonly measured hair ﬁber dimensions are length and diame-ter. Assuming that a hair ﬁber approximates a cylinder, its volume, cross-sectionalarea, radius, and surface area may be obtained from formulae that describe thevolume of a cylinder (Vcylinder ), the area of a circle (A circle), and the surface area of aright cylinder (S cylinder ), in terms of its diameter (D) and length (L).Vcylinder ¼0:7854 D2LAcircle¼0:7854 D2Scylinder ¼DPLAlthough human hair ﬁbers vary in cross-sectional shape, from nearly circular to

ﬁber coarseness can signiﬁcantly reduce experimental scatter. A convenient equa-tion for calculating the cross-sectional area of an ellipse is:Aellipse¼pR1R2where R 1is the radius of the maximum diameter and R 2is the radius of theminimum diameter.Whenever maximum and minimum diameters are given one may calculate theaverage diameter from the following equation:Daverage ¼pDmaximum /C2DminimumFiber thickness is usually characterized as ﬁber diameter or cross-sectional area.Corrections to diameter for ellipticity are often not employed and are usually notrequired except for highly elliptical hair ﬁbers. Hair ﬁber dimensions are alsonecessary to calculate fundamental elastic properties, and dimensional changesare often employed to follow the course of chemical reactions with hair.For measurement of short lengths of hair ﬁbers (in the millimeter range or less) a
microscope may be used, but for longer lengths (several centimeters or longer) acathetometer is useful. Although ﬁber diameter may be measured directly with amicroscope, or more crudely with micrometer calipers, other excellent methods areavailable for determining cross-sectional dimensions of human hair. More recentlylaser scanning equipment has been employed similar to the system described by Liand Tietz [ 113]. This approach should improve the precision of the measurementsover microscopy especially when averaging over large sections and large numbersof ﬁbers.9.7.1 Methods to Determine Hair Fiber DimensionsBoth single-ﬁber and multiple-ﬁber methods are available for determining hair ﬁbercross-sectional dimensions or changes. Single-ﬁber methods include linear density,microscope (light or electron), vibrascope, micrometer caliper, and laser beamdiffraction. For multiple-ﬁber determinations, a centrifuge and optical scanningdevices may be used.9.7.1.1 Linear Density Method
9.7.1.1 Linear Density MethodThe linear density method is one of the methods of choice, for determining hairﬁber coarseness (diameter). A ﬁber is cut to a given length (10 cm is convenient),conditioned at 55–65% RH, and weighed on a microbalance sensitive to 2 mgo r9.7 Dimensions, Swelling and Effects of Fiber Shape on Reactivity 575
better. This gives the ﬁber weight in g/cm, which is divided by the ﬁber density,1.32 g/cm3, to obtain the cross-sectional area in cm2(A).A¼g=cm1:32The area so calculated is independent of cross-sectional shape. The ﬁber diame-ter (D) may then be calculated, assuming circularity:D¼pA=0:7854The volume (V) in cm3for a given weight (M) of hair may be calculated from theﬁber density:V¼M=1:32Finally, the length (L) of a ﬁber of volume V and radius r may be rechecked(since it is precut at a speciﬁed length and measured):L¼V=r2PThe length may then be used to estimate the surface area (Su).Su¼2PrLThis scheme assumes that the density of all hair ﬁbers is the same. It requires aminimum of manipulations and is an excellent “averaging technique” for dry state
dimensions of hair ﬁbers. Cross-sectional area and volume estimates for circularand elliptical ﬁbers should be relatively accurate, as well as diameter and radius forround ﬁbers. This method does not provide an indication of ellipticity, but providesan average diameter with respect to length as well as to cross section (averagediameter, not maximum or minimum diameter). The deviation of ﬁber diameterwith increasing ellipticity is described in Table 9.9which shows only about 1%difference in cross-sectional area by assuming circularity or a regular ellipse from40 to 120 microns and from an elliptical ratio of 1.10–1.78.9.7.1.2 Microscopic MethodSeveral excellent papers [ 114–116] describe experimental details for measuring thediameter of human hair ﬁbers with a light microscope. Once the diameter isobtained, calculation of radius, cross-sectional area, volume, and surface areamay be made as described in the previous section.576 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
The light microscope is an excellent instrument for determining dimensionalchanges in hair ﬁbers while they react with either liquid or gaseous systems(including moisture in air). The light microscope can also be used to measuredeviation from circularity; although, extensive manipulation and multiplemeasurements (10–20) along each ﬁber’s axis are required for accurate measure-ment. A modern scanning electron microscope, with vernier, is also a usefulinstrument to measure dry state (approximately 0% RH because of evacuation)diameter of human hair ﬁbers.9.7.1.3 Vibrascopic MethodThe vibrascope [ 117,118] is a device that applies an oscillatory force of knownfrequency to a ﬁlament under tension. The ﬁber cross-sectional area (A) in cm2maybe computed from the lowest (natural) frequency (f) in cycles per second thatproduces mechanical resonance. The tension (T) on the ﬁber is in dynes, the ﬁberlength (L) is in cm, and its density is 1.32 g/cm3.fi¼12LpT=1:32 A
3.fi¼12LpT=1:32 AThe ﬁber diameter, radius, volume, and surface area may then be calculated asdescribed.This method assumes that the ﬁber is a homogeneous ﬁlament and provides anaverage diameter. Nonetheless, it has been shown by Montgomery and Milloway[117] to be in close agreement with microscopic measurements of the diameterof nylon ﬁbers. The vibrascopic method, like the linear density method, is anexcellent averaging technique and offers time advantages over microscopicmethods.Table 9.9 Deviation of the diameter of a circle from the major and minor axes of an ellipseArea assume Average DassumingRatio D 1/D2aCircle Circularity1.108 1.234 1.500 ~1.78mm2mmD 1 D2 D1 D2 D1 D2 D1 D21,257 40.0 42 38 44 36 49 32.7 53.3 30Ellipse area 1,253 1,244 1,258 1,25611,310 120.0 126.3 114 133.3 108 147 98 156.5 92Ellipse area 11,308 11,307 11,314 11,308D1¼major axis of ellipse, D 2¼minor axis of ellipse and R1 and R2 ¼radius in mm

9.7.1.4 Micrometer Caliper MethodThis method works well for hard ﬁbers like steel, tungsten, and glass, but not as wellfor softer ﬁbers like human hair. It is a crude but fast way to approximate hair ﬁberdiameter. Since hair ﬁbers yield to low compression forces, and these forces aredifﬁcult to control, the micrometer caliper technique tends to provide low values forﬁber diameter and a large variance.9.7.1.5 Sieving Hair FibersBusch [ 119] used ﬁne-mesh sieves to separate ﬁne hair ﬁbers from a bundle for furthercharacterizations. It is conceivable that further separations of hair ﬁbers may beachieved via sieving and average diameters approximated via this useful technique.9.7.1.6 Laser Beam Diffraction MethodBrancik and Datyner [ 120] described the diffraction of monochromatic light from alaser to measure the diameter of single wool ﬁbers in liquids. Busch [ 119] used alaser beam diffraction system with robotic control for characterizing hair ﬁber
diameter and shape for a large number of hair ﬁbers. Also, see the paper by Liand Tietz [ 113].9.7.1.7 Centrifuge MethodThe centrifuge method has been described by Valko and Barnett [ 74] and byBarnett [ 121]. This method involves treating a known weight of parallel ﬁbers(400–800 mg and approximately 20 cm long) with a liquid, centrifuging to removeexcess liquid between the ﬁbers, and reweighing. This is a good averaging tech-nique for multiple ﬁbers and is well suited to follow reactions with hair ﬁbers bymeasuring the percentage weight gain of liquid imbibed by the hair. This methodmay be used to approximate ﬁber volume changes in aqueous systems, since weightgains at different relative humidity correspond relatively well to volume increases(see Table 9.10). From volume changes, cross-sectional area, diameter, length,surface area, and other dimensional changes may be computed (see the sectionentitled Linear Density Method for details).
entitled Linear Density Method for details).9.7.1.8 Optical Scanning Devices for Determining Fiber DiameterOFDA (optical ﬁber diameter analyzer) laser scanning as described by Watt [ 123]was originally developed for the wool industry. However, this method has found578 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
application for most natural and synthetic ﬁbers including human hair. This methodessentially takes images of an array of ﬁbers (several hundred in cross-section) andscans the ﬁeld with a laser that measures the width or diameter of the exposed ﬁbersthat are free from other ﬁbers. Temperature and relative humidity are also recordedat the time of measurement. This method offers time and cost advantages andaverages a large number of hairs.9.7.2 Fine Coarse HairConsumers usually evaluate ﬁne or coarse hair by handle or feel; however scientistsgenerally evaluate these parameters by measuring ﬁber diameter or cross-sectionalarea. Fine and coarse distinctions are used for qualitative comparisons in the cosmeticindustry, but there are no accepted quantitative deﬁnitions of these terms analogous towool ﬁber. One reference that deﬁned ﬁneness of human hair quantitatively by ﬁberdiameter is by Courtois et al. [ 124] in a study of ageing and hair cycles. This reference
deﬁned hair ﬁneness by the diameters summarized in Table 9.11.Although such a classiﬁcation of hair ﬁneness by diameter as in Table 9.11might be useful in some cases, it describes the average hair of Caucasians andAfricans as coarse and the hair of Asians (described below) as very coarse.However, this is not the way we normally classify Caucasian hair. To date, I haveTable 9.10 Percentageweight and volume changesversus RH for wool ﬂberChanges caused by absorption of water%R H% volume [ 122]increase% weight [ 37]increase% weight [ 74]increase00 0 09 – 3.9 –10 5.7 – –20 – – 7.640 12.2 10.2 –60 16.3 – –63 – 14.8 –86 – 22.6 –90 24.6 – –100 32.1 31.2 31.1Table 9.11 Hair ﬁne tocoarse and ﬁber diameter byCourtois et al.

not been able to ﬁnd any other reference that used this quantitative classiﬁcation byCourtois et al. [ 124].On the other hand, coarse and ﬁne are more clearly deﬁned quantitatively for thewool industry because the diameter of wool ﬁbers is related to both the end use andto the breed of sheep/animal. Table 9.12 shows deﬁnitions for wool ﬁber diametersexpressed as ﬁne or coarse with additional distinctions. In general, wool ﬁbers<25mm in diameter are used for garments whereas coarser grades are used forouterwear or rugs. Such distinctions for wool ﬁber are clearly more useful than forhuman hair; however, some quantitative distinctions for coarse and ﬁne human haircould be useful to the cosmetic industry.9.7.3 Variation in Fiber Cross-Sectional Shape with Emphasison Diameter and Ellipticity9.7.3.1 Fiber Diameter by Geo-Racial GroupThe term race applies to sub-populations or groups of people similar in several
biological characteristics. In the past, races developed and persisted because travelover large distances was limited, thus, similar peoples interacted and procreated.The geographic or racial differences that are found today in hair and skin type aremost likely remnants of prior adaptations to temperature, sun exposure and otherenvironmental inﬂuences.The words ethnic and ethnicity have been misused in the cosmetic industry.Ethnicity relates more to similarities in or shared social customs. Race relates moreto similarities in physical characteristics. In the following pages I refer to geo-racialgroups linking geographic origin to race. I will try to refrain from using the phrase
ethnic hair, but I will sometimes inadvertently use the term geo-ethnic. Thecosmetic industry frequently refers to these three primary geo-racial hair types:African type hair originates primarily from south, west, or central Africa and thedonors with a few exceptions tend to have heavily pigmented skin. Asian type hairoriginates from mid-eastern and south East Asia and the donors tend to have light toTable 9.12 Fine-coarse woolﬁbers deﬁned by ﬁberdiameter [ 111]Type of wool ﬁber Diameter in mmUltraﬁne merino <17.5Superﬁne merino 17.7–18.5Fine merino <19.5Fine medium merino 19.6–20.5Medium merino 20.6–22.5Fine <24.5Medium 24.5–31.4Fine crossbred 31.5–35.4Coarse crossbred 35.5580 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
medium skin pigmentation. Caucasian hair originates from northern Europe orNorth Africa and the donors tend to have lightly pigmented skin, but some mayhave heavily pigmented skin.These geo-racial groups will be referred to frequently in the sections involvinghair ﬁber shape focusing on ﬁber diameter, ellipticity and hair ﬁber curvature.These three geo-racial groups correspond to the Ethiopian, Mongolian and Cauca-sian groups used in a prior edition of this book. Fiber curvature and cross-sectionalshape as well as pigmentation variations of human scalp hair are controlled geneti-cally (Chap. 3) and these ﬁber shape characteristics control much of the cosmeticand physical behavior of human hair. Therefore, geo-racial information on haircharacteristics can and has been useful to the cosmetic scientist, although a centuryfrom now it will likely be less useful.Other classiﬁcations such as by curvature type will ultimately become more
important to cosmetic science than the three geo-racial groups because curvature isso important to all cosmetic hair assembly properties as discussed in the last part ofChap. 10. Consider the fact that the cosmetic behavior of scalp hair of a Caucasianof Curl type IV hair by the STAM procedure [ 47] (see the section entitled ,Measuring Hair Fiber Curvature in this Chapter ) has more in common with Curltypes IV of the African and Asian groups than with a curl Type I or II of their owngeo-racial group. The commonality is in the way their hair behaves with regard tothe more important cosmetic hair assembly properties described later in Chap. 10.During the latter days of this century and the next, populations of Curl types III,
IV and V will likely increase and Curl types I and VIII will decrease. So, in thenear future we must learn to type hair even better by its physical characteristicsand become more quantitative with regard to its relationships to its importantcosmetic hair assembly properties. Table 9.13 summarizes the general qualitativecharacteristics of the scalp hair of the three major geo-racial groups.It is generally accepted that on average the hair of Africans and Asians is coarserthan that of Caucasians [ 125,126]. Randebrock [ 126] suggested that human hairfrom the scalp varies from 40 to 120 mm in diameter. Kaswell [ 127] indicated thatthe diameter of human scalp hair varies from 15 to 110 mm. The lower end of thisestimate likely includes infants and children’s hair. Yin et al. [ 112] suggested thatCaucasian hair of adults (the ﬁnest of the three major races) varies from 50 to90mm. Yin is talking about the variation in diameter means of the hair of
individuals rather than the total variation among individual hairs among differentTable 9.13 Hair ﬁber characteristics by geo-racial groupFiber characteristics [ 125,126]Geo-race Coarseness Curvature Cross-sectional shape ColorCaucasian Fine Straight to curly Nearly round to oval Blond to dark brownAfrican Coarse Wavy to wooly Slightly oval to elliptical Brown-black to blackAsian Coarse Straight to wavy Nearly round to slightlyovalDark brown to brown-blackSee Fig. 9.189.7 Dimensions, Swelling and Effects of Fiber Shape on Reactivity 581
Caucasians. We found slightly greater variation for the means of Caucasianindividuals’ hair than suggested by Yin et al.Other sources cite even larger variation for example, Elert [ 128] cites from 17 to181mm. Elert most likely is referring to variation among individual hairs and notmean ﬁber diameters for individuals, and Elert likely includes minimum to maximumﬁber diameter for adult, children’s and infants’ hair rather than means. For example,Nagase et al. [ 93] measured maximum and minimum hair ﬁber diameters on hairfrom 132 Japanese females ranging from 10 to 70 years of age. The maximumdiameters, of 8,926 hairs, varied from 30 to 170 mm averaging 95.3 /C616.5mma n dthe minimum diameters varied from 30 to 130 mm averaging 74.4 /C610.5mm.Table 9.14summarizes means for human scalp hair diameter by geo-racial group
from several references showing that hair from Caucasians is ﬁnest and hair fromAfricans is coarser while hair from Asians is coarsest. For this table, I attempted touse averages from hair of 10 or more persons per group. In a few cases I could notdo so. The pooled hair was averages of 10 hairs from each group with hairs frommore than one person. The Steggarda and Siebert [ 129] data used in previouseditions was deleted because these scientists used hairs from only ﬁve females.The actual diametric variation of individual hairs must be greater than shown inthe distributions of Table 9.14 which are obtained from averaging means of severalhair ﬁbers for several subjects. The three largest studies of the data listed inTable 9.14 are the study by Nagase et al. [ 93] on scalp hair of Japanese femalesages 10–70 and the study of Trotter and Dawson [ 133] on hair of “Americanwhites” and French Canadians [ 131]. Data was extracted from these two latter
studies for females of ages 10–89. Nagase et al. measured and listed maximum andminimum diameters while Trotter and Dawson measured linear densities on the hairof American whites and French Canadians. For French Canadian hair, thesescientists also measured maximum and minimum diameters and linear densitiesfrom which the calculated diameters compared favorably.Fig. 9.18 General shapes ofhuman hair of different geo-racial origins582 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers

The percentage standard deviations of the data of the two studies by Trotter andthe one by Nagase were similar and close to 17% which was used to estimate thelikely range of means from individual persons for each of the three geo-racialgroups. These estimates for Asian hair, 54–110 mm, for African hair 48–96 mm and46–94 mm for Caucasian hair. This is a much more conservative and very differentestimate than the 95% conﬁdence intervals for the actual data of Table 9.14 whichis for Asian hair 84.9–78.3 mm and 78.99–64.51 mm for African hair and72.99–68.6 mm for Caucasian hair. The 95% conﬁdence interval is actually therange within which the actual mean of that data is likely to reside at the 95% level.The study by Otsuka and Nemoto [ 134] was the largest study found in theliterature for human hair diameters (Table 9.15). This paper did not describe detailsof how the hair was obtained or measured. The data of Table 9.15 shows that the
Asian hair sampled was coarser than the Caucasian hair examined. These data alsoshow that sampling or the actual populations chosen to represent either the Asian orCaucasian hair groups can have an inﬂuence on the dimensions found. For examplehair from females in Japan and China provided a slightly larger diameter than hairfrom females from Japan, China and Thailand combined.The diameter estimates for the Asian hair in this study by Otsuka and Nemotoare close to those of the averages of the studies of Table 9.14; however the estimatesfor the Caucasian hair are considerably lower than those found for Table 9.14.Otsuka and Nemoto suggest about a 30 mm difference between Caucasian hair andJapanese hair, but the data of Table 9.14 suggest about half that difference. Iconclude that part of this difference (between Otsuka and Nemoto data and thedata of Table 9.14) is from real diametric differences and part to sampling, scalp
site and to un-described methodology [ 134]. For example, Trotter and Dawson[131,133] found that hair of French Canadians (N ¼136) was 4 micrometerscoarser than hair of European “white Americans” (N ¼183). In the data ofTable 9.15 we see a similar difference for the two Caucasian groups, but part ofthis difference may also be due to experimental variation.Trotter and Dawson found that the hair of the French Canadians was darker incolor than that of the Americans which could be due to differences in physicalcharacteristics resulting from genetics and in this case related to geographicaldistribution of the different Caucasian populations. For example, the Trotter andDawson data may include hair of northern Europeans (American whites) versussouthern Europeans (French Canadians), a difference which is frequentlyTable 9.15 Approximate scalp hair diameters by race/country for females (ages 10–89) [ 134]Asian CaucasianJapan (J) +China (C)Japan + China +ThaiUSA Eur. + Am W.

speculated and described for a limited number of individuals hair, but for which Icould not ﬁnd a large supporting study.Frequency graphs for each group of women in the study by Otsuka and Nemoto[134] approximate a Gaussian distribution. Random sampling of large groups ofwomen in most populations likely are similar provided ages are limited from about10 to 60. When a large percentage of older persons are included, especially oldermen, the distributions will tend to deviate from Gaussian; see the section in thisChapter entitled, Hair Diameter of Males versus Females . Table 9.16 wasconstructed primarily from calculations to approximate the average maximumand minimum diameters and cross-sectional areas from the three major geo-racialgroups. Whether one calculates cross-sectional areas assuming circularity or aregular ellipse the results are within 1% of each other (see Tables 9.9and9.16).A discussion of how hair ﬁber diameter varies with age is described in this
chapter in the section entitled, Fiber Diameter, Cross-sectional Area, Fine CoarseHair and Hair Growth .9.7.3.2 Hair Fiber Diameter and Ellipticity Variation Along the FiberAxis or LengthIn 1942, Seibert and Steggerda [ 138] examined long hairs cut from the scalps of 7Caucasian and 9 Mayan females. They selected the longest 80–100 hairs averaging40–50 cm long and measured maximum and minimum diameters on these ﬁberssectioned at 2, 10, 20, 30, and 40 cm from the original cut near the scalp. In all but 3of 16 cases the hairs were larger in area and maximum diameter at their terminal ordistal end than at the basal cut. This effect is signiﬁcantly different by the non-parametric sign test. In addition, the ellipticity (major to minor axis of the diameter)tended to decrease in the direction toward the scalp.About 50 years later, Hutchinson and Thompson [ 139] reported changes in the
major-axis diameter of human scalp hairs that they associated with changes occur-ring inside the follicle, during the growth of human hairs. Hutchinson andThompson concluded that hair ﬁbers do not grow as uniform cylinders. But, theyTable 9.16 Calculated maximum D and minimum D and cross-sectional areas for Asian, Africanand Caucasian hairHair type Ave D Max D Min D Elliptical ratioaCross-sectional area Ave. curl typeAsian 82 93.4 72.7 1.28a5,333 IICaucasian 70 82.8 60 1.38a3,902 II, IIIAfrican 72 93.6 55.8 1.68a4,104 IV to VIIIDiameter values in mm and area in mm2(average D is from Table 9.14)All other values calculated from these equations via iterationElliptical Ratio ¼Max D =Min DAve D ¼pDmax /C2D minCross - sectional area ¼pRmax /C2Rmin ðR¼radius ÞaSee Table 9.17 for references on elliptical ratios9.7 Dimensions, Swelling and Effects of Fiber Shape on Reactivity 585
hypothesized that from the distal end of each hair ﬁber for a distance toward thescalp of about 6–8 cm an increase in diameter occurs that they associated with thestart up of anagen (approximately 5–7 months growth). After that distance of6–8 cm, their data showed a gradual decrease in the major-axis, but not the minoraxis of the ﬁber. The overall effect from that point is a gradual decrease in ﬁberellipticity, cross-sectional area and diameter of each hair shaft.When reading this paper, I was skeptical because the authors miscalculatedcross-sectional areas by a large factor and they hypothesized in some instanceswithout data. But after reading the previous paper by Steggarda and Siebert [ 138]and the following paper by Nissimov and Elchalal [ 140] I came to accept thegradual decrease in the major axis from the distal end of the ﬁber.Nissimov and Elchalal [ 140] conﬁrmed this effect and they observed the opposite
effect during pregnancy. That is during pregnancy the major axis of the ﬁbersincreased from distal to proximal end by 4.5% through 35 weeks of pregnancy. Thisstudy was conducted on 15–20 hair ﬁbers each from 13 non-pregnant women (averageage 36 years) and 12 post-term pregnant women (average age 29 years). The majoraxis of the hair ﬁbers in the control group of non-pregnant women during this same35 week period decreased from distal to proximal end by 5.2%. The decrease in themajor axis of hair ﬁbers from only 4 Caucasian non-pregnant women observed byHutchinson and Thompson was 16.4%. Only a small (likely non-signiﬁcant) increaseof 2.5% was observed in the minor axis on these same hair ﬁbers.Such variation within each hair ﬁber helps to explain the wide variation that we
observe in maximum and average ﬁber diameters and ellipticity and when consid-ered with variation among individual hairs on a head and between heads why largesample sizes are necessary to provide meaningful data when measuring hair ﬁberdiameter parameters.9.7.3.3 Ellipticity of Human Scalp Hair by Geo-Racial GroupTable 9.17 shows that hair from Africans has a greater deviation from circularity(average major axis to minor axis D1/D2of 1.74) than hair from the other two geo-racial groups and compares favorably with the calculated value of Table 9.16.The hair from Asians is the most circular with an average elliptical ratio of 1.27and for Caucasians, this ratio is 1.38 and is very close to be calculated values ofTable 9.16. These data suggest that the calculated circular diameter for Asian and
Caucasian hair averages about 13% and 16%, respectively, from the major andminor axes of noncircular ﬁbers. Therefore, in most circumstances, the assumptionof circularity is an acceptable approximation. However, this deviation averagesabout 26% or greater for most African hair. So, the assumption of circularity forAfrican hair should be carefully considered.The conﬁdence intervals above in Table 9.17 suggest that there is a 95%probability that the true mean is within this interval. The distributions of theindividual geo-racial groups are normal and the Asian, African and Caucasianmeans are all signiﬁcantly different by parametic and non-parametric statistics.586 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
The estimated distributions suggest variation in ellipticity found among individualhairs from the data by Nagase [ 93] and by Trotter [ 131,133].The study by Nagase et al. [ 93] contained 132 Japanese females ages 10–70and a total of 8,926 hairs were measured for maximum and minimum diameter.Therefore, this study is the most reliable with respect to the range of ellipticity forindividual hairs (not means) for this geo-racial group, which varied from 1.02 to2.19 with a mean of 1.28 comparing favorably with the average of all the studies of1.27. This study by Nagase et al. also shows that individual hairs from Asians canvary in ellipticity from nearly circular to highly elliptical.Trotter and Dawson [ 133] and Trotter [ 131] measured ellipticity on 6,400
Caucasian hair ﬁbers from 242 males and 398 females. This study is described inmore detail in the next section of this Chapter. Statistical analysis indicated nodifference in ellipticity between males and females. Ellipticity for these 6,400 hairsvaried from 1.09 to 2.13 similar to the range found by Nagase et al. on the hair ofJapanese females. Note that the ranges for these two studies are similar, but themeans are different 1.36 for Caucasians versus 1.28 for the Japanese. Also, theranges are larger than for the Africans because of the much larger number of hairsused in the Caucasian and Japanese studies. These distributions are obviously notGaussian, but when 25 or more hairs are averaged the means are quite reliable. Alsonote that, the size and shape of hair ﬁbers vary along the ﬁber length as describedearlier. Some of these variations have been attributed by Orwin [ 142] to growth
patterns and environmental effects.Table 9.17 Ellipticity of hair ﬁbers from three geo-racial groupsSource Asian African CaucasianMean (N) Range Mean (N) Range Mean (N) RangeSteggarda [ 129] 1.25 (10) 1.65 (9) 1.25–2.05 1.35 (10)Wolfram [ 130] 1.29 (20) 1.21–1.36 1.84 (20) 1.67–2.01 1.49 (20) 1.43–1.56Syed [ 44] – 1.83a1.69–2.09 1.29a1.06–1.52Vernall [ 137] 1.23 (20) J 1.69 (19) 1.44 (21)Franbourg [ 132] 1.23 (5) 1.16–1.28 1.78 (14) 1.67–1.85 1.32 (11) 1.25–1.39Nagase [ 93] J 1.28 (132) 1.02–2.19 – –Porter et al.

9.7.3.4 Hair Fiber Ellipticity and Age Among Caucasians and AsiansHair Fiber Ellipticity and Age Among CaucasiansTo date, I have been able to ﬁnd several studies of hair ﬁber ellipticity versus age[131,133,143]. Three of these papers are from the anthropological literature byTrotter and cited in the previous section. In Trotter’s earliest paper [ 131], she tookhair from 340 Caucasians (American whites) ages 0–79 and measured the majorand minor axis diameters of hairs taken from the vertex and calculated both cross-sectional sizes and ellipticity. Ten hairs were used per subject.Trotter and Dawson [ 133]a l s om e a s u r e dt h em a j o ra n dm i n o ra x i so f1 0h a i r sp e rsubject from the vertex of 300 Caucasians (French Canadians), 122 males and 178females age 1–89. If we combine the results of these two studies we have ellipticitymeasurements of 6,400 hairs from Caucasians. The results are summarized in
Table 9.18 showing an average ellipticity of 1.36 for Caucasians with a range of1.09–2.13 in the study on Americans. Trotter separated the data for the FrenchCanadians into seven different age groups for males and females and eight differentage groups for the American Caucasians allowing matched pairs statistical analysistesting for seven groups of the data showing no signiﬁcant difference for the ellipticitybetween Caucasian males and females in both studies and an average ellipticity of1.36 for Caucasians.Hair Fiber Ellipticity for Caucasians from Infancy Through ChildhoodTrotter and Duggins [ 143] ran another study among Caucasian children by havinghair sent to them periodically at 1 year intervals starting with infants throughpuberty. This study was discontinued after 17 years because of drop-outs. Thesescientists started with 15 infants each at 1 month (50 hairs) and 7 months (50 hairs)
and summed these two data points to represent 100 hairs at age 1 (closer to ½ year).Then they measured 100 hairs from each of these same 15 subjects at 2 years of age,with one additional child at age 2 and continued with these 16 children until age 7.At age 8 one dropped out, but at age 11 four other children dropped out until age 13Table 9.18 Hair ellipticity for two groups of Caucasians [ 131,133]Group No. subjects Mean ellipticity Ellipticity rangeMales Females Males Females Males FemalesFrench Canadians 122 178 1.37 1.38American Caucasians 120 220 1.35 1.34 1.09–1.75 1.11–2.13Total Caucasians 242 378 1.36 1.36 1.09–1.75 1.11–2.13Matched pairs testaProb <t¼0.28 Prob <t¼0.69 1.31–1.43 1.27b–1.48aNote, the mean ellipticities for males and females are exactly the same.

when four more dropped out rendering the study suspect beyond 10 years of age.Their data up to 10 years of age are summarized in Table 9.19.Not counting the 1 month and 7 month sampling, Trotter and Duggins hadcollected yearly data points measuring 100 hairs from each of 14 subjects fromage “1” through age 10. Trotter and Duggins [ 143] commented on the smalldifference found between the males versus females. However, since only sixmales and eight females were in this study I concluded that the sample size is toosmall for a meaningful comparison.I analyzed these data of Trotter and Duggins by not combining the 1 month and 7month data and by not examining data beyond age 10. I used the Wilcoxon signedrank test for paired observations. The results are summarized in Table 9.19 and
demonstrated that the largest change occurs after 1 month where the hair is moreround in the earliest stage of infancy. The 1 month data is signiﬁcantly differentfrom all other ages including the 7 month measurement (P <0.0001). It would alsoappear from diameters that another change occurs a few years later.Hair Fiber Ellipticity Versus Age Among AsiansAnother useful study on ellipticity versus age is at higher ages and is from a paperby Nagase et al. on Japanese hair [ 144]. The authors of this paper [ 144] measuredellipticity among 132 Japanese females. These scientists found no statisticallysigniﬁcant effect for the variation of ellipticity with age from 10 to 70 years.Table 9.19 Means for the effects of age on the hair index from approximately 1 month throughage 10 for the same 14 Caucasian childrenAge AverageindexaMaximum/minimumdiameter (ellipticity)1 month 79.42b1.262 years 69.36 1.443 years 69.64 1.444 years 70.93 1.415 years 70.71 1.41

The lines indicate the values that are notsigniﬁcantly different from each other9.7 Dimensions, Swelling and Effects of Fiber Shape on Reactivity 589
Regression analysis provided an average ellipticity of 1.28 with a signiﬁcantp value, but an index of determination (r2) of 0.0001 showing that the variationin ellipticity by age among Japanese females was very small (0.01%) or notmeaningful.This study on the hair of Japanese women shows no effect of age on hair ﬁberellipticity between the ages of 10–70 while two studies on Caucasian males andfemales over a similar age range also showed no effects of age on scalp hair ﬁberellipticity. I would speculate a similar effect for African hair, but not with a highlevel of conﬁdence because of the very large hair ﬁber ellipticity among that geo-ethnic group.9.7.3.5 Fiber Diameter, Cross-Sectional Area, Fine Coarse Hair and Ageand Hair GrowthInfants’ is Finest and Children’s’ Hair is Fine; for Females it is Coarsest (LargestDiameter) Near the Mid-Forties but Males’ Hair is Coarsest in the Late Teens toEarly Twenties
Early TwentiesAs described in Chap. 1, the mechanism for hair growth involves three stages: agrowing period called anagen; a transition period, catagen and a resting period,telogen. At telogen, the “old” hair falls out and is replaced by a “new” hair ﬁber.The time-span of the growth period (anagen) determines how coarse and how longscalp hair ﬁbers will become. The time-span of anagen is shortest for infants, longerfor children and longest from puberty to young adulthood, see Table 9.20.Trotter and Duggins [ 143] studied hair ﬁber cross-sectional areas from infancythrough childhood on the same 14 Caucasian subjects that they studied ellipticityfrom 1 month through 10 years of age. Their cross-sectional area data along withﬁber diameters (calculated assuming circularity) are summarized in Table 9.21.The data of Table 9.21 were analyzed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for
paired observations showing highly signiﬁcant differences between the cross-sec-tional areas at 1 month, 7 months and 2 and 3 years from all other ages. Several ofthe other pairs were not signiﬁcantly different as indicated by the connecting linesTable 9.20 Hair growth period, ﬁne coarse hair and hair length of Caucasians femalesHair type Approximate Approximate Est. anagen (Yr)Max. length (cm) Diameter ( mm)Infant ~15 30 (N ¼26)a~0.5Children (0–9) ~60 62 (N ¼82)b~4 yrAdult (15–29) ~100 74 (N ¼98)b~6 yrAdult (30–89) – 70 (N ¼75)b~5 yrVellus ~0.1 ~4 –aPecoraro V et al.

in this table. Clearly, the cross-sectional areas are smallest at 1 month. The cross-sectional areas and therefore average diameters are also smaller at 7 months, 2 yearsand 3 years compared with all other values except 1 month. Three to four times thepercentage change in cross-sectional area occurs between 1 and 7 months and 7months and 2 years compared to the total change that occurs between 4 and 7 yearsof age. These dimensional changes in the hair ﬁber correspond reasonably well withthe generalized description by Furdon and Clark [ 147] that the ﬁne hair of infantstends to be lost by about the sixth or seventh month and is replaced by a coarser hairthat grows longer. This hair then is replaced by an even coarser hair at about 2–3years of age that grows even longer.Hair Fiber Diameter Versus Age for Males and FemalesThe study by Otsuka and Nemoto [ 134] on the hair of Japanese males (1,177) and
females (7,580) between the ages of 10 and 60 shows a larger and earlier decrease inhair ﬁber diameter for men than for women; see Tables 9.22 and9.23.For Japanese males, the study by Otsuka and Nemoto shows that scalp hair ﬁberdiameter increases to a maximum to the late teenage years and then it decreasesrelatively rapidly with increasing age, see Fig. 1.10. These data suggest that forJapanese women, scalp hair diameter increases to a maximum near the age of 40and decreases thereafter.Similar effects (a peak in diameter during the teenage years for males followedby a gradual decline after that and an increase in diameter for women during theteens to the 40s when a decline begins) can be seen in a study by Trotter andDawson [ 133] for hair of French Canadians (see Table 9.23). Trotter and Dawsonnoted this effect was not statistically signiﬁcant by comparing subgroups of malesTable 9.21 Cross-sectional area and calculated average diameters versus age for hair from

versus females. However, the study of Trotter and Dawson involved only 136females and 82 males compared to 18,262 females and 1,177 males in the Japanesestudy.The work of Courtois et al. [ 124] comparing hair ﬁber diameters on the samemale subjects over a period of several years provides support for a decrease in hairdiameter of male Caucasians with age between the ages of 25 and 49. Courtois et al.[124] studied 10 Caucasian adult male subjects (starting at ages 25 up to 49 years ofage) by making observations periodically over 14 years. These scientistsdemonstrated a reduction in the duration of the growth period (anagen) coupledwith a decrease in the diameter of hair shafts with increasing age. In addition, thetime interval separating the loss of a hair in telogen and the appearance of areplacement hair in anagen also increased.Therefore, this study by Courtois et al. [ 124] on Caucasian adult males
demonstrated that hairs on the same male Caucasians after puberty become ﬁnerover the years conﬁrming the conclusions of Otsuka and Nemoto [ 134] on age andﬁber diameter on different Japanese males. This study by Courtois et al. on adultCaucasian males also conﬁrms the conclusions on the effects of age on the diameterof scalp hair of male Caucasians from the French Canadian data of Trotter andDawson.A very large study by Robbins and Dawson et al. [ 148] measured mean hair ﬁberdiameters from 250 to 400 hair ﬁbers from each of two sites one on the left and oneon the right parietal region on more than 1,000 female Caucasians from age 18 to66. In this study both an Optical Fiber Diameter (OFD) system and an ImageAnalysis system were used for diameter measurement; therefore, these data werenot included in Table 9.14. However, data comparing the OFD method with laser,
microscopic and linear density methods on the same 39 hair samples demonstrated77.31 mm for the OFD and 75.57 mm for the laser (no signiﬁcant difference),71.34 mm for the linear density and 66.7 mm for the microscopic method withboth of the latter methods providing signiﬁcantly different diameters from the OFDmethod.The OFD and the IA data from this large study of female Caucasians wereregressed against age providing a curvilinear relationship, see Fig. 9.19. Themaximum mean ﬁber diameter occurred between 43 and 46 years of age (by bothdiameter measurements) and is likely linked to the peri-menopause. The quadraticequation for the OFD method provided a p <0.0001, r2¼0.0257 and a root meansquare error of 9.380 with a maximum diameter at age 43. A cubic equationprovided a p <0.0001, r2¼0.0282 and the root mean square error was 9.370and a maximum diameter at age 46, see Fig. 9.19. Data from the quadratic model
along with instantaneous rates of diameter change with age are summarized inTable 9.23.The data from Table 9.23 shows that hair ﬁber diameter in the parietal region offemale Caucasians increased from about age 18 until about 43–46 whereupon itpeaked and then decreased with increasing age. This effect contrasts with data formales [ 131,133,134] where the maximum for mean ﬁber diameter peaks in the lateteens to early twenties, see Tables 9.22 and9.23.9.7 Dimensions, Swelling and Effects of Fiber Shape on Reactivity 593
Data for scalp hair diameter of Japanese females has been shown to occursomewhere around the age of 40 [ 134] and the median menopausal age occurs atabout 50–51 for women of most industrialized countries including Japan. There-fore, it is likely that menopausal status has a similar effect on scalp hair diameter ofwomen of most industrialized countries and that estrogens are somehow involved inhair ﬁber diameter. Therefore the mean ﬁber diameter for hair from Japanesewomen may actually be a little higher than found in the study by Otsuka andNemoto and closer to the age of 43–46 as shown for Caucasian women by Robbinsand Dawson et al.The quadratic model for the subjects in the Robbins and Dawson et al. studysuggests that the instantaneous rates of change of diameter (Table 9.23) or the speedof hair diameter change actually decreased at a constant rate of /C00.0236 mM/year(2nd derivative of the quadratic model). Even though the actual diameter increased
from age 20 to about 45 the rate and amount of diameter increase actually decreasedand it continued to decrease at this constant rate to about age 45 whereupon thediameter began to decrease and this process continued with advancing age.The Effect of Scalp Site on Hair Fiber DiameterMirmirani and Dawson et al. [ 149] demonstrated that mean ﬁber diameters for femaleCaucasians are signiﬁcantly higher in pre- versus post-menopausal women for thefrontal but not the occipital site. The larger study by Robbins and Dawson et al. [ 148]shows that the parietal region follows a similar pattern to the frontal site. TheFig. 9.19 Hair ﬁber diameterfor Caucasian females by animage analysis method fromRobbins and Dawson et al.[148]594 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
maximum mean ﬁber diameter in the parietal region occurred in the vicinity of theperi-menopause which is characterized by irregular periods or cessation of periods forless than 12 months. These studies collectively suggested that menopausal status hasa major impact on scalp hair ﬁber diameter for the frontal and parietal regions but notthe occipital site. This study also suggests that more studies on different scalp sites arenecessary to fully understand the properties of human scalp hair.The follicle is the sac that each mammalian hair ﬁber grows in. In sheep, ﬁne-wool breeds tend to have follicles of narrower diameters whereas longer folliclescorrelate with longer wool ﬁbers as shown by Orwin [ 152]. We would expectsimilar trends to exist in human hair. Furthermore, Lindelof et al. [ 150] providedevidence that the size and shape of the human hair follicle tends to correlate withthe hair ﬁber shape. However, there is strong evidence that hair ﬁber composition
and the distribution and orientation of different proteins in the cortex provide themajor contribution to the hair ﬁber shape (see Chap. 1for a more completediscussion of this subject).Why Hair Fiber Diameter of Males Versus Females Provides Inconsistent ResultsSteggarda and Seibert [ 129] examined scalp hair ﬁbers from six different racialgroups and claimed signiﬁcant differences by sex. However, these scientists exam-ined hair ﬁbers from only ﬁve males and ﬁve females for each group measuring70–100 hairs from each person.The confusion in the scientiﬁc literature about the diameter of hair of malesversus females can be explained by examining the studies of Otsuka and Nemoto[134], Robbins and Dawson [ 148] and the work of Trotter and H.L. Dawson assummarized in the preceding section. These studies all show that hair ﬁber diameter
for females increases until about 40–46 years of age, however the work of Otsukaand Nemoto and Trotter and Dawson and Courtois all show that the diameter ofscalp hair of males peaks much earlier, somewhere near the age of 20. Therefore,diameter comparison of the scalp hair of males versus females is most likely verydependent on the sampling ages. If additional differences exist between the scalphair of males and females due to geo-racial effects (between Asians andCaucasians) these will only be evident after larger scale comparative studies areconducted.The largest difference in the diameter between hair of males and females most
likely occurs at middle age (near ages 35–46), where the diameter of the hair offemales is near a maximum and the diameter of the hair of males had beendecreasing for about two decades. This difference most likely will become smalleras we move to younger ages from middle age to the teenage years and should eitherbecome equal or cross over near ages 15–20.9.7 Dimensions, Swelling and Effects of Fiber Shape on Reactivity 595
Fine Hairs do not Grow as Long in Length as Coarse HairsInfants’ hair generally does not exceed 15 cm length and it is very ﬁne. Pecoraroet al. [ 146] examined the hair of 26 new born infants within 76 h of birth. Thesescientists found that the average diameter was 30 mm and estimated the anagenperiod to be only a few weeks. Children’s’ hair prior to puberty usually does notexceed 60 cm long and it is coarser than infant’s hair as shown by Bogaty [ 145].But, adult hair has the capacity to grow even longer and is even coarser. Withadvancing age, hair ﬁbers become ﬁner [ 131,133,134,148] and will not grow ascoarse [ 124,134] or as long as in prior adulthood. Courtois et al. [ 124]demonstrated for male Caucasians that with increasing age beyond puberty, anagenbecomes shorter. Saitoh et al. [ 151] examined the hair of one Japanese male at 60
years of age. Saitoh et al. found the average anagen for hair ﬁbers growing on thevertex of the scalp was 23 weeks and the range was 17–94 weeks for “coarse” hair.These same scientists [ 151] found longer anagen time spans for two other subjects21 and 30 years of age, but the time spans for anagen exceeded the time allocatedfor writing the paper so additional data was not available.Because of the relationship of the time-span of anagen to hair fullness on thescalp and to longer and coarser hairs, anagen to telogen ratios have been used tomeasure either hair growth or hair loss. The evidence shows that coarse hairs on thesame person become ﬁner with advancing age [ 124] conﬁrming the conclusions ofOtsuka and Nemoto [ 134] on age and ﬁber diameter on different persons. Further-
more, the growth period and hair length (if never cut) also become shorter. Thesefacts suggest that neighboring hairs on the same scalp that are ﬁner should also notgrow to as long a length as coarser hairs (never cut). Furthermore, ﬁne versus coarsehairs among different persons will likely not grow as long in length and they willhave a shorter anagen time span.Hair Fiber Diameter Varies by a Factor of About 2 on Each ScalpMost of the work in the scientiﬁc literature is on scalp hair from the vertex or thecrown area of the scalp, although hair from other areas of the scalp is sometimesused [ 149]. Garn in his PhD thesis at Harvard University in 1948 was one of the ﬁrstto claim that scalp hair is ﬁnest at the temples and most coarse at the lowersideburns on “normal” scalps. “Normal” scalp usually means pre-alopecia or beforethe phenomenon of balding begins. The lower sideburns are actually beard hairwhich is coarser than scalp hair of the vertex. Tolgyesi et al. [ 152] demonstrated
that beard hair also contains a higher amount or higher percentage of hairs withmedulla. Beard hair is also more elliptical and has more irregular cross-sectionalshapes than scalp hair. Beard hair also has lower disulﬁde content (cross-linkdensity) than human scalp hair [ 152].For adult Caucasian individuals, the average diameter (from the vertex or crownareas) usually ranges from about 46 to about 94 micrometers. Scalp hair diametershows large differences among neighboring hairs on the same head, ranging from a596 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
factor of less than 1.4 to more than 2.0 on adult Caucasian women [ 112]. Garn isessentially in agreement with Yin et al. [ 112] on these ranges on an individual scalp,claiming as early as 1948 that the average diameter of neighboring hairs on thesame scalp may vary by more than a factor of 2. Hair on different regions of thescalp grows at different rates as described in Chap. 1. DeBerker et al. [ 153] haveshown that on “normal” scalps, hair grows slowest on the temples (0.39 mm/day formales ~14 cm/yr) and faster on the vertex (0.44 mm/day for males ~16 cm/yr)where it grows coarser.Fine Hair Tends to be Lighter in Color than Coarse HairThe extreme case supporting this conclusion is that vellus hair, the ﬁnest of all hairsdoes not contain pigment, whereas most permanent hairs the coarsest of scalp hairsgenerally contain pigment. Caucasian hair on average is ﬁner than Asian or Africanhair and on average it is lighter in color. Schwan-Jonczyk [ 154] demonstrated that
the size of the pigment granules in scalp hair is larger in Asian and African hair thanin Caucasian hair. Fitzpatrick et al. [ 155] described that the hair of Africans tends tobe black and that the pigment granules of the hair of those of African descent tend tobe larger than those of dark European hair. Schwan-Jonczyk [ 154] also determinedthat the pigment granules from dark European hair are on average larger than thoseof blonde and red hair.In addition to pigment size, the main pigment of darker hair is eumelanin,whereas pheomelanin is the primary pigment of most red and some blonde hairs.There are undoubtedly exceptions to this conclusion that ﬁne hair tends to be lighterin color than coarse hair, because hair color is determined by several variablesincluding the type of melanin pigment, the size of the pigment granules and the
density (frequency) of the pigment granules that are dispersed throughout the cortexof human scalp hairs, however there are several other references supporting thisconclusion and some of these are described below, also see Chap. 5for additionaldetails.Pecoraro et al. [ 146] examined hair from 26 infants within 76 h of birthconsidering hairs from 13 males and 13 females. These scientists found that themean coarseness of dark hairs from dark complexioned newborns was 37 mm whilethe average diameter for light colored hairs from light complexioned newborns was22mm.Trotter and Dawson [ 131,133] examined hair of children and adult Caucasians(French Canadians and Americans). They concluded that coarse hair tends to bedarker than ﬁne hair [ 131,133]. In addition, Bogaty [ 145] concluded from his
review of the anthropological literature that Caucasian children’s hair is on averageﬁner, rounder, less frequently medullated and lighter in color than adult’s hair, seeTable 9.24.9.7 Dimensions, Swelling and Effects of Fiber Shape on Reactivity 597
Is Gray Hair Coarser than Highly Pigmented Hairs on the Same Scalp?Whether gray hair is coarser than highly pigmented hairs on the same head is still inquestion because of mixed results. This subject is covered in detail in Chap. 5in thesection entitled, Hair Pigment Structure and Chemical Oxidation . See these [ 156,157] and other relevant references in Chap. 5.Cross-Sectional Size and Hair Fiber CurvaturePorter et al. [ 47] found a signiﬁcant negative correlation between hair ﬁber curva-ture and cross-sectional area (R2¼0.98) from 12,050 African type hair ﬁbers thatvaried from curl class IV to VIII, see Table 9.25. Therefore, 98% of the variation incross-sectional area of this type of hair over this curvature range can be explainedby hair ﬁber curvature and the cross-sectional area decreased with increasing ﬁbercurvature over this curvature range.Even though we were unable to ﬁnd direct data on curl type versus cross-
sectional area for Asian or Caucasian hair, the data of Table 9.25 shows this samedirectional trend on averages for cross sectional area and curvature for these threehair types. For example, the average cross-sectional area for Asian hair is highestand that for African hair is lowest with Caucasian hair in the middle. While theinverse holds for Curl Type. It will be interesting to see if this same trend existswithin these populations (Asians and Caucasians), because if it does then hair ﬁberTable 9.24 Caucasian children’s hair is ﬁner and lighter than adult’s (N ¼310)aAges Diameter ( m) % brown-black % blond-dark blond % light blond0–4 58 35 50 155–9 66 75 22 310–14 69 96 4 015–19 74 98 2 020–29 73 98 2 030+ 70 97 3 0aData from anthropological study of French Canadian hair by Trotter and Dawson [ 133]Table 9.25 Cross-sectional areas and curvature for average Asian, African and Caucasian hairHair type Ave D Max D/Min D Cross-sectional area Ave. curl type

curvature could be calculated from cross-sectional area data provided a suitablemodel equation could be developed.Hair ﬁber diameter correlates positively with cross-sectional area. Otsuka andNemoto [ 134] have shown that hair ﬁber diameter of Japanese females from ages 40and up decreases with age. Furthermore, Nagase [ 93] determined that hair ﬁbercurvature of the hair of Japanese females ages 10–70 increases with age. Therefore,we can conclude for Japanese females ages 40 and higher hair ﬁber curvaturecorrelates negatively with diameter and cross-sectional area of hair.9.7.4 Effects of Fiber Cross-Sectional Shape on Properties andReactivityThe previous section shows how the ﬁber c ross-sectional shape can vary betweenand within different geo-racial groups and Figs. 9.20–9.25 illustrates some of theshape variation of human hair. As indicated, hair ﬁber cross-sectional shape variesFig. 9.20 Caucasian hairﬁber with a slight twist(bottom ) and ﬂattened areas

within each geo-racial group and even on a single person’s head. Even though wetalk about the hair of Caucasians as repres enting relatively cir cular hair ﬁbers,Figs. 9.20 and9.23–9.25 show the “normal” variation that encompasses non-circular cross-sectional shapes that can be found on Caucasian scalp hair.Indented areas are frequently observed (Fig. 9.20). Twists in human hair ﬁbersare not un-common especially in African type hair (Figs. 9.21 and 9.22).Fig. 9.21 African American hair ﬁber with multiple twists. Light micrograph kindly provided byJohn T. WilsonFig. 9.22 An AfricanAmerican hair ﬁberillustrating a ﬁber twist athigher magniﬁcation than forFig.9.21. Light micrographkindly provided by John T.Wilson600 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
Figures 9.20 and9.24 illustrate twists in Caucasian hair and Figs. 9.21 and9.22showing more extensive twists in African American hair. Flat spots and high spotsare also common (Figs. 9.23–9.25) in hair of all origins. Widely varying diametersoccur in ﬁbers from the same scalp and even on the same hair ﬁber. As indicated, arule of thumb is that hair ﬁber diameter on the same scalp varies by about a factor oftwo [ 112].These different ﬁber shapes affect not only the physical properties of theﬁber such as ﬁber breakage and abrasion resistance, but, ﬁber shape also affectsthe physico-chemical reac tivity of the ﬁber. Figure 9.25 shows an electronmicrograph of an irregularly shaped ha ir ﬁber from the scalp of a Caucasianfemale. This ﬁber contains ﬂat and high s pots that form ridges along the axis of theFig. 9.23 A Caucasian hair ﬁber with a large indented area on its surface. Note the irregular shapeon the rest of the hair created by this indent

ﬁber. This hair ﬁber had previously been permanent waved and dyed on the scalpand then treated in the laboratory with alternating treatments of triethano-lammonium lauryl sulfate and stearal konium chloride. This type of treatmentraises scales on ﬁbers that are damaged in the cuticle cell membrane complexor the endocuticle.The scale lifting that resulted occurred more on the high spots along the ridges ofthe ﬁber than on the ﬂat areas. This effect in scale lifting not only represents adifference in reactivity along the ﬁber cross-section, it makes the scales on theridges more susceptible to fragmentation and removal and subsequently makesthese high spots more susceptible to further penetration and damage by chemicaltreatments and rubbing actions.Fig. 9.25 Scale lifting on a highly irregular shaped hair ﬁber surface. Note the greater lifting onthe ﬁber “high spot” where the scales are most severely bent602 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
This ﬁber shape induced reactivity difference is only one example of the variationin reactivity on hair ﬁbers caused by ﬁber shape variation. Undoubtedly many of theexperimental variations that we observe in hair science that are difﬁcult to explainmay be caused by ﬁber shape variations and oftentimes they go unexplained.9.7.5 Scale Type of Mammalian Hair is Related to Hair FiberDiameterA series of papers were written in the 1920s by Hausman [ 160] on structuralfeatures of the hair of mammals. Hausman classiﬁed cuticle scales of differentmammals on the basis of their size and shape into two general kinds that he calledimbricate and coronal, see Fig. 9.26. Hausman then divided the imbricate typescales into ﬁve different kinds and the coronal scales into three different kinds, seeFig. 9.26. Human scalp hairs ﬁt into the ﬂattened imbricate classiﬁcation ofHausman. Hausman [ 160] deﬁned the scale index as the scale interval (free
proximo-distal diameter) of a cuticle scale (F) in Fig. 9.26 divided by the shaftdiameter or F/D ¼scale index. After examining 190 samples of dorsal under-hairof many species of mammals, Hausman concluded that the scale index is relatedmore to the diameter of the scales than to the scale type classes that the species havebeen assigned to, thus the scale index is inversely related to the diameter of the hairshaft.Fig. 9.26 The scale indexand different scale shapes ofmammalian hair ﬁbers(adapted from Hausman[160])9.7 Dimensions, Swelling and Effects of Fiber Shape on Reactivity 603
Hausman did not provide a statistical model for this relationship. Therefore, Iexamined his graph of Scale Index versus ﬁber diameter for different mammalianspecies. From that graph, I estimated the Scale Index versus ﬁber diameter from24 data points for different mammals over the range of 7–99 mm and using JMPstatistical software calculated a quadratic model as the best ﬁt with an R2of 0.916and a p value of <0.0001.This equation {Y ¼0.0382–0.01333 X + 0.000209 (X-48.0385)2} where Y ¼the predicted value of the scale index and X ¼ﬁber diameter provided predictedvalues for the scale index versus diameter as summarized in Table 9.26 Thepredicted data of this table show that the scale index is inversely related to theﬁber diameter and this relationship is strong. An interesting observation is thatHausman did this work nearly 90 years ago and it is still very useful.Wynkoop [ 161] examined the form of cuticle scales and the extent of medulla
(described in Chap. 1) with respect to age. However, Wynkoop used too fewsubjects’ times hairs. For example, other than age group 0–9 and 20–29, she used3 hairs from only 1 to 9 persons per group. However, Wynkoop did show a betterﬁt of scale index and extent of medulla with ﬁber diameter than with age. Fromwhat we currently know about ﬁber diameter, scale interval and extent ofmedulla, large variations are inherent in data of these varia bles. Therefore,Table 9.26 Scale indexversus hair ﬁber diameter formammalian hair ﬁbers [ 160]Estimated scale index Diameter Predicted scale indices1.48 7 1.311.3 9 1.221.02 11 1.131.1 12 1.080.7 15 0.960.88 18 0.860.68 20 0.790.7 24 0.960.52 26 0.620.78 27 0.600.4 34 0.450.5 36 0.420.48 38 0.390.38 42 0.340.26 50 0.270.22 60 0.220.16 70 0.200.14 74 0.190.16 76 0.180.20 78 0.180.18 83 0.160.07 93 0.090.06 96 0.060.06 99 0.03604 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
I conclude that if Wynkoop would have used more hairs and more subjects foreach age group, she would likely have shown a relationship of both scale indexand age and the extent of medulla with age. For example since children’s hair isﬁner than adults hair there should be more m edulla in adult’s hair than children’shair, see Chap. 1in the section entitled Medulla for details on the medulla andﬁber diameter.Takahashi et al. [ 162] examined the scale interval for a large number of Asianand Caucasian scalp hair ﬁbers. The total number of subjects was 89 Japanese and214 Chinese for Asian hair and 160 Germans and 50 Americans for Caucasian hair.Two hundred and eighty two hairs from these Caucasian females and 200 hairs fromthe Asians were measured at more than 300 points on each hair ﬁber for the scaleinterval which was found to be 6.61 /C60.52mm for the Asian hair and 6.98 /C60.60mm for the Caucasian hair. This difference is signiﬁcant beyond the 0.001 level.
Using the average diameters for Asians and Caucasians from Table 9.14, I calcu-lated the scale indices for these two groups to be 0.103 for the Caucasians and0.0796 for the Asians hair. These values are reasonably close to the predicted valuesof 0.115 and 0.087 from the quadratic prediction equation for the data extractedfrom Hausman’s graph on different mammalian species. See the section in Chap. 1entitled The Cuticle .The question now is what is the effect of the scale interval (F in Fig. 9.26) on hairproperties? My conclusion is that since the scale index (F/D) is strongly correlatedwith hair ﬁber diameter then the scale interval F is also. So, if we normalize the datato ﬁber diameter the effects will largely be compensated for in our calculations.Furthermore, cuticle scale thickness (thickness of each cuticle cell times thenumber of cuticle layers) both of which Takahashi et al. [ 162] demonstrated to be
larger in Asian versus Caucasian hair will play a stronger role than the scale intervalor scale index in ﬁber reactivity. Takahashi et al. in this same paper determined thatwet cuticle fragmentation is different in Japanese versus Caucasian hair. Therefore,the cuticle composition including the ratio of exocuticle (A-layer plus exocuticle) toendocuticle will play a larger role in cuticle damage than the scale interval or thescale index. I also conclude that the primary changes versus age of these parameterswill occur in infants, versus children’s versus adults’ hair with possibly the elderlybeing different from younger adults. However, none of these effects have beenexamined to date.9.8 Hair Fiber Curvature9.8.1 Factors Related to the Origin of Fiber ShapeNot considering permanent waving or straightening, the longitudinal ﬁber shape(curvature) is genetically determined (see Figs. 9.27 and9.28). Curvature is related
to the degree of coiling including natural crimps and bends of hair ﬁbers and is the9.8 Hair Fiber Curvature 605
most important ﬁber characteristic involved in styling, combing, and other aspectsof hair assembly behavior. Permanent waves and hair relaxers function primarily bychanging ﬁber curvature to produce either a curlier or a straighter hair. Figure 9.27depicts hair ﬁber curvature by the Robbins–Reich system and Fig. 9.28 by theSTAM. When curvature is low, the hair is relatively straight as in tresses withratings of 0, 2 and 4 in Fig. 9.27 and STAM I and II in Fig. 9.28. When hair isrelatively straight, friction and stiffness play a very important role in hair assemblybehavior. However, when the hair is very curly as in tress 16 by Robbins–Reich orIV by STAM or even curlier, then ﬁber curvature has the ability to dominate otherﬁber properties and control hair effects.Fig. 9.27 Hair of different ﬁber curvatures illustrating how hair assembly volume increases withcurvature by the Robbins–Reich method
curvature by the Robbins–Reich methodFig. 9.28 Hair of different ﬁber curvatures by the Segmentation Tree Analysis Method (STAM)illustrating curvatures from level I to VII. I could not ﬁnd hair of level VIII for this illustration606 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
The Robbins–Reich method for determining hair ﬁber curvature works well forcurl classes I through IV (Fig. 9.28), but does not distinguish as well as STAM forhigher curvatures. Furthermore, since the STAM curvature method has beenapplied to so many subjects (more than 2,400) in so many different countries andit can be applied to curl types I to VI from curl radius or curl diameter data or evencalculated from hair ﬁber ellipticity; for these reasons this author recommends theSTAM method for hair ﬁber curvature over his own method.The dominant feature relevant to the origin of hair ﬁber shape is the distributionof different types of cortical cells in the ﬁber. In general, hairs that are straightcontain a distribution of cortical cells that may be pictured as concentric circles.That is they are symmetrically arranged about a common axis in the center of theﬁber. On the other hand, curly hairs contain different types of cortical cells on the
inside of the curl relative to the outside of a curl. Therefore, the cortical cells ofcurly hairs tend to be distributed more in a bilateral type arrangement. For a morecomplete discussion of hair ﬁber shape including a review of the current status ofthe origin of hair ﬁber shape see the section in Chap. 1entitled The Origin of HairFiber Curvature .9.8.2 A Historical View of Approaches to Measure Hair CurvatureMany attempts have been made to classify the longitudinal shape or the curvature ofhuman hair ﬁbers both in the anthropological and cosmetic ﬁelds of hair science. Ina review paper, Trotter [ 163] described the history of curvature classiﬁcation
wherein she indicated that in the early nineteenth century, there were two qualita-tive distinctions for human hair, straight-wavy hair and wooly or tufted hair. Thenext meaningful step in the classiﬁcation of hair curvature occurred in the mid tolate nineteenth century and involved combinations of curvature and cross-sectionalshape characteristics. Then in 1900, Deniker [ 164] provided four semi-quantitativeclasses for curvature for physical anthropology:Straight and smooth hairWavy hair: a long curve from one end to the otherFrizzy hair: hair rolled spirally with rings 1 cm or more in diameterWooly hair: spiral curves from 1 to 9 mm in diameterMartin in 1928 [ 165] published his 3 major curvature classes with sub-groups:Smooth: straight, smooth, shallow wave subgroupsWavy: wide waves, narrow waves, curly subgroupsKinky: frizzy, loose kinks, tight kinks, tight spirals subgroupsAnother important step was to provide more quantitative classiﬁcations or
deﬁnitions for the longitudinal shape of hairs. Hardy [ 48] deﬁned several longitu-dinal shape characteristics and measured these for seven different populationsincluding the following:9.8 Hair Fiber Curvature 607
Kink: “a sudden constriction and twisting of the hair shaft producing an obviousdiscontinuity in curvature”.Curl radius or radius of Curvature: compare each curve of a hair to curves of atransparent template consisting of circles of known radius.Average Curvature: is “the inverse of the average radius of curvature”.Ratio of maximum to minimum curvature: Ratio of the “highest to lowest” radius ofcurvature of a hair ﬁber.Crimp: (Hardy adopted the deﬁnition of the wool industry) “number of times thedirection of curvature changes per unit length”.“Ratio of natural to straight length”: the effect of curling on the hair ﬁber length.Others have used some of Hardy’s deﬁnitions or minor modiﬁcations to approx-imate or assess hair ﬁber curvature. For example, Nagase et al. [ 93] and Kajiuraet al. [ 166] used the curl radius. Robbins and Crawford [ 167] used the inverse of theratio of maximum to minimum length. Porter et al. [ 47] used curl diameter and De
La Mettrie et al. [ 158] and Loussouarn [ 159] combined three parameters usedseparately by others including curl diameter, the ratio of maximum to minimumlength [ 3,48,167] and the number of wave crests for a given length [ 3]. Robbinsand Reich [ 3] described another approach based on the number of wave crestsdivided by the ratio of the minimum to maximum length, see Fig. 9.27. But, to datenone of these methods have received wide acceptance outside of their ownlaboratories.The STAM described ﬁrst by De La Mettrie et al. [ 158] classiﬁed the curvatureof hair from 1,442 subjects, see Fig. 9.28. Subsequently, Loussouarn et al. [ 159]published data with measurements and curvature classiﬁcation on hair from anadditional 1,007 subjects. A third paper from this same laboratory by Porter et al.[47] used the STAM to examine the behavior of African type hair as a function ofcurvature and provided minor adjustments to the original parameters forclassiﬁcation.
Using data from several different researchers and technical papers [ 48,129,166,168] where either curl radius or curl diameter are provided, one can show that thismeasurement permits meaningful classiﬁcations, over the ﬁrst ﬁve curl groups.Furthermore, ellipticity [ 47] may be used to calculate Curl type classes between IVand VIII when STAM curl typing has not been done. Such a method for the entirecurl range is described in the next section of this Chapter, entitled Curvature by theSTAM method can be approximated by Calculation from Ellipticity.The STAM method consists of measuring three parameters after the 6 cm hairﬁbers are washed in dilute detergent rinsed with water and allowed to dry to theirnatural curvature for at least 5 min:The smallest curl diameter is then measured for each ﬁber ¼CDThe ratio of the straight length 6 cm to the curled length is then taken ¼L6//LCThe number of wave crests are counted on a 5 cm ﬁber when it is held at

Curvature is then classiﬁed by the following criteria:Curl Type I ¼CD>10:8c mCurl Type II ¼CD between 5 :7 and 10 :8c mCurl Type III ¼CD between 3 :1 and 5 :7c mCurl Type IV ¼CD between 1 :2 and 3 :1c mCurl Type V ¼CD<1:2 cm and L 6=LC<5:9 and W <or¼3 wavesCurl Type VI ¼CD<1:2 cm and L 6=LC<5:9 and W ¼or>4 wavesCurl Type VII ¼CD<1:2 cm and L 6=LC>5:9 and W ¼or>5 wavesCurl Type VIII ¼CD<1:2 cm and L 6=LC>5:9 and W ¼or>6 wavesCurl types I through IV are classiﬁed by curl diameter alone. The othermeasurements are used to distinguish between Curl types V through VIII.9.8.3 Curvature by the STAM Method can be Approximatedfrom EllipticityEllipticity has been shown to increase with ﬁber curvature in separate studies withlarge numbers of hair ﬁbers on hair of widely differing curvatures, one study onJapanese hair by Nagase et al. [ 93] on more than 8,900 hair ﬁbers (small effect) andanother study on African type hair by Porter et al. [ 47] on more than 12,000 hair
ﬁbers (larger effect). Since these two ranges of ellipticity and curvature cover theentire scale of curvatures and ellipticity for human scalp hair, this relationshipshould exist for all geo-racial hair including Caucasian. A regression equation wascalculated by taking a total of 9 data points, 3 directly from the graph of Nagaseet al. [ 93] and 5 from the prediction equation from Porter et al. [ 47]. One furtherassumption was that an ideal ellipticity of 1 occurs at an ideal Curl type of 1 forSTAM Curvature [ 47]. The relationship is best described by this cubic equation ofthe natural logarithm of Curvature versus Ellipticity (E):ln Curl type ¼/C0 1:8087þ1:9765 E þ4:0319ðE-1:474Þ2þ10:039ðE-1:474Þ3The R2¼0:9993 ;p<0:0001 and Root Mean Square Error ¼0:023519.8 Hair Fiber Curvature 609
The reliability of this model is supported by the data of Table 9.27 showing areasonable ﬁt for the calculated Curl types which are generally within plus or minus0.5 from the referenced STAM values; however for the one African sample thecalculated value is off by 2.2 which may be due to a poor ellipticity value. Moredata is required to provide a better feeling for the real reliability of this model,however it should serve as a reasonable approximation. This model will likely workbest for mean ellipticity values from more than 20 hairs for a hair sample rather thanfor individual hairs. The hair of the people of India by ellipticity and Curl type ismore Caucasian-like than East Asian-like and the model conﬁrms this observationwhich is consistent with genetic studies.9.8.4 Variation of Curvature Across Populations and CountriesTable 9.28 summarizes data from the Loussouarn et al. [ 159] study by STAM for
hair ﬁber curvature for three major geo-racial groups. The American Anthropolog-ical Association (AAA) issued a statement on race on May 17, 1998 stating that,“human populations are not unambiguous, clearly demarcated, biologically distinctgroups” [ 169]. Furthermore the statement said, “Genetics indicates that mostphysical variation about 94% lies within so-called racial groups.” The AAATable 9.27 Calculation of STAM curl type from ellipticityType of hair Ave. curl typeaCalc. curl typebAve. ellipticity£ 1.0 1.0 1.0€ 2.3 2.43 1.34€ 2.6 2.9 1.45€ 4 4.15 1.596¥ 5 4.7 1.63¥ 6 5.54 1.668¥ 7 6.5 1.7¥ 8 8.2 1.74China 1.62 [ 158] 2.04 1.23 [ 136,137]Asian 1.92 [ 159] 2.16 1.26 [Table 9.17]Japan 2.03 [ 93] 2.22 1.28 [ 93]India 2.41 [ 158] 2.58 1.38 [ 137]Caucasian 2.57 [ 159] 2.50 1.36 [Table 9.17]Brazil 3.19 [ 159] 3.05 –African 5.93c8.2 1.74 [Table 9.17]W.

provided this relevant example [ 169], “Dark skin may be associated with frizzy orkinky hair or curly or wavy or straight hair”.It is true; linkage of hair ﬁber curvature to skin color alone just does not work.For example dark skinned people of African descent will most likely have verycurly to kinky hair while similarly dark skinned people from northern India willmost likely have very straight hair and many dark skinned people from southernIndia (sometimes called Dravidians) will have curly to wavy hair. But, if we linkgeographic origin, with racial origin and the tendency for skin color of the geo-racial group then the association with hair type increases markedly as shown by thedata of Tables 9.24–9.29.The following discussion considers curvature classiﬁcation of hair ﬁbers frommore than 2,800 persons from the following references [ 47,48,129,158,159].
From these data sets we considered that Native Americans ﬁt into the Asian groupand that most other Americans can ﬁt into one of the other three major geo-ethnicgroups while most of the peoples of Europe, Asia and Australia also ﬁt into thesethree groups.The data of Table 9.28 shows that more than 90% of the African type hairexamined is distributed primarily in Curl types V through VIII. Nevertheless, thehair of small percentages of panelists of African origin who are currently located inthe United States and Northern African countries were classiﬁed in curl groups IIIand IV. Asian hair is most frequently found in curvature classes I through IV with amaximum percentage in group II. Caucasian hair is also found in groups I throughIV, although the data shows it to be more of a Gaussian type distribution over these4 curl types than for Asian hair.From the data of Table 9.28 there appears to be a clean break for Asian and
Caucasian hair between curl groups IV and V with virtually no persons abovegroup IV from these two populations. Now if we consider geography alone, forthe United States or Europe all eight curv ature classes will be found. And if weconsider skin color alone, all eight cur l types will also be found. Therefore thissummary of the data of Table 9.28 shows more meaningful distinction among haircurvature types can be made by considering geographic origin that I callTable 9.28 Hair curvature by STAM for three major geo-ethnic groups from de la Mettrie et al.[158], Loussouarn et al.

[ 158]and Nagase [ 93] shows hair curvature distrib utions from 4 different Asiancountries. A concern is in the small sample numbers for the Korean and Japanesehair classiﬁcations by de la Mettrie, that is the number of subjects is so small thatthe total distribution is most likely not representative of the hair for thosecountries. This conclusion is reinforced by the data of Table 9.29.T h eD eL aMettrie et al. data [ 158]o fT a b l e 9.29 from only 40 Japanese subjects shows hairclassiﬁed in curl Types I, II and III only, while the data by Nagase et al. [ 93]measuring curl radius of hair from 230 Ja panese subjects provides an average curldiameter of 8.8 cm and a distribution from 1.2 to 32 cm corresponding to a STAM
curl classiﬁcation over all four curl Types I to IV. The Nagase data also provides43% in Curl type II while the de la Mettr ie provides 67%. The average curldiameter (peak in the distribution curve) by Nagase et al. corresponds to curl typeII which is the largest percentage Curl t ype found by de la Mettrie for Japanesehair also, see Table 9.29.The data by Nagase [ 93], Hardy [ 48] and Kajiura et al. [ 166] are different studieswhere the curl radius was measured, while the study by Porter et al. [ 47] measuredcurl diameter, but STAM was not used for classiﬁcation of hair curvature in themanuscripts of these later four studies. Therefore, I converted curl radius to curldiameter for Table 9.30 and classiﬁed the data by the STAM procedure showinggood agreement with expectations. For the data by Syed et al. [ 44] I calculated thecross-sectional area and ellipticity and used the equations above to approximate theCurl type between curl classes IV to VIII.
This type of hair ﬁber curvature classiﬁcation can be done conveniently fromcurl radius or curl diameter data for curl types I through V and from ellipticity datafor Curl types I through VIII.The conversion of curl radius or diame ter or ellipticity from differentlaboratories to the STAM hair curvature types of Table 9.30 provides goodagreement with the classiﬁcati ons found by De La Mettrie et al.

as shown by these curl assignments in Table 9.30, it allows useful curvaturedistinctions. Furthermore, because of th e large database provided by de la Mettrieet al. and Loussouarn et al., I recommend t hat our industry adopt this method (or aminor modiﬁcation of it) for future hair ﬁber curvature comparisons. Whereverpossible in this book I have tried to refer to hair curvature comparisons by theSTAM hair curvature types.9.9 Water (RH), pH and Solvents and the Dimensions of Hair9.9.1 Hair and Wool Have Similar Water Binding Amounts andGroupsStam et al. [ 122] used a microscopic method to measure changes in the length anddiameter of human hair ﬁbers at different RH’s and calculated changes in cross-sectional area and volume (see Table 9.31). These data show a small increase inﬁber length and a large increase in diameter with increasing RH. This swellingbehavior of hair is related to its fundamental structure as described in Chap. 1in the
section entitled, Swelling Behavior of Hair .Although the swelling behavior of keratin ﬁbers is usually explained in terms of itsintermediate ﬁlament-matrix components, Swift [ 170] and others have providedevidence that the non-keratin portions of hair may also be important to ﬁber swelling.For example, Swift demonstrated by microscopic studies involving the penetration ofﬂuorescent labeled proteins into hair in an aqueous medium that a large orderswelling occurs in the non-keratin regions of hair. The diameter swelling of hair bywater from the dry state is usually given as about 14–16%. On the other hand, X-raydiffraction measurement of intermediate ﬁlament separation distances by Spei andZahn [ 171] indicates that swelling of only 5.5% occurs in these regions.Swift [ 169] therefore proposed that the difference may be explained by the large
order swelling that occurs in the non-keratin regions of hair, primarily theendocuticle and the cell membrane complex of hair. However, greater swelling isTable 9.31 Dimensional changes of human hair versus RH [ 122]% RH Moisture absorption% increasein diameter% increasein length% increasecross-sectional area% increasein volume00 0 0 010 2.3 0.56 4.7 5.740 5.1 1.29 10.5 12.260 6.9 1.53 14.3 16.390 10.6 1.72 22.3 24.6100 13.9 1.86 29.7 32.1614 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
expected in the keratin associated proteins than the intermediate ﬁlaments. Foradditional details on hair swelling, see Chap. 1.The hysteresis in the moisture absorption-desorption curves of keratin ﬁbers isan interesting phenomenon. At any given RH between 0% and 100%, human haircontains less water when absorbed from the dry state compared to when itundergoes desorption, that is when it loses water from the wet state (see Table 9.32).Chamberlain and Speakman [ 36] observed this phenomenon earlier for human hairand Speakman [ 37] observed it for wool ﬁber (see Table 9.33). Additional waterbinding when the hair is wet occurs because certain groups in hair that are capableof binding water are not accessible to water vapor from the shrunken dry state. Onthe other hand, when the hair is highly swollen with liquid water these groups areaccessible and water binds to them.Stam et al. [ 122] found that tension on hair ﬁbers inﬂuences their dimensions
(moisture content) at different RH’s. For example, stretching hair ﬁbers below 60%RH provides less swelling than for un-stretched hair, while stretching hair at RHabove 60% provides more swelling than un-stretched hair.Table 9.33 shows that moisture loss (desorption) and regains (absorption) forhuman hair and wool ﬁber are virtually identical. It has been suggested [ 30] that themoisture regains of human hair and wool ﬁber are virtually identical up to about90% RH, where they diverge wool to a regain of 33%, and hair to about 31%, thedifference most likely due to the higher cross-link density in human hair. However,even if divergence does occur, the actual difference in moisture regain by these twoﬁbers is relatively small which suggests that to a large extent the same functionalgroups are responsible for water binding in hair and wool ﬁber.Table 9.32 Absorptionverses desorption of moisture[122]% RH Absorption %increase in volumeDesorption %increase in volume00 010 5.7 6.8

The rate of moisture regain is considerably slower from water vapor than fromliquid water (diffusion-controlled reaction). Liquid water at room temperature willpenetrate the hair in less than 15 min and in <5 min at 92/C14F( ~ 3 3/C14C) [122], whereas18–24 h is required for single ﬁbers to equilibrate in a humid atmosphere, with evenlonger times for a ﬁber assembly as shown by Steinhardt and Harris [ 172].9.9.2 Variation of Fiber Surface Area with DiameterFor a given weight of hair, the ﬁber surface area is inversely proportional to the ﬁberdiameter. Table 9.34 shows how the calculated ﬁber surface area varies withdiameter for 1 g of hair (assuming it is a right cylinder).9.9.3 The Swelling of Human Hair Changes with pHThe swelling of human hair in aqueous solutions after 24 h or longer at different pHvalues exhibits four distinct parts [ 109–111] (Fig. 9.14):1. A minimum in swelling from pH 4–9
1. A minimum in swelling from pH 4–92. Above pH 10, a large increase in swelling3. pH 3–1, a slight increase in swelling4. Below pH 1, a slight decrease in swellingThe minimum in swelling from pH 4–9 is consistent with the observation ofSteinhardt and Harris [ 172]. In the absence of added electrolyte, there is nocombination of wool ﬁber with mineral acid or alkali from pH 5 to 10. This isin the vicinity of the isoionic point of ha ir (the neutral point for the total ﬁber,which is when the number of positively ch arged and negatively charged groups isequal). The large increase in swelling a bove pH 10 is largely due to ionization ofdiacidic amino acid residues in the hair and partly due to keratin hydrolysis. Theincrease in swelling from pH 3 to 1 is due to the combination of acid with thedibasic amino acids. Breuer [ 75] attributed the decrease in swelling below pH 1 toan irreversible structural change.
an irreversible structural change.Ehrhardt (private communication) observed alkaline swelling in 0.1 N NaOHafter only 5 min of reaction with hair at 95/C14F (~35/C14C). Under these conditions, aTable 9.34 Fiber diameterand surface areaFiber diameter(mm)Calculatedasurfacearea (cm2for 1 g hair)Calculated relativesurface area40 758 3.080 379 1.5120 253 1.0aFor 1 g of hair, assuming it is a right cylinder616 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
similar effect was not observed using 0.1 N hydrochloric acid. The swelling ofhuman hair in acid below pH 3 is slightly less than that of wool ﬁber [ 114], and hasbeen attributed to the higher cross-link density of human hair [ 34,114].9.9.4 Solvents and Swelling of Human HairValko and Barnett [ 74] and Barnett [ 121] showed that acetonitrile, triethyl-phosphate, and glycerol swell hair to a lesser extent than water. In fact, glycerolis sometimes used in tensile or torsional testing to approximate 0% RH [ 25]because of the lack of hair swelling when hair ﬁbers are immersed in this solvent.Dimethyl formamide, ethylene glycol monomethylether, and diethylene glycolmonomethylether swell hair similar to water, although the rate of swelling bythese solvents is slower than the rate of swelling by water [ 74,121]. Glacial aceticacid and formic acid swell hair to a greater extent than water [ 74,121]. Formamide
and urea (aqueous solutions of urea) also produce swelling beyond that of water,probably by promoting greater cleavage of hydrogen bonds than produced by water[66,121].Amines such as ethyl amine, at 25% in water or higher concentrations, swell hairto a greater extent than water. These solutions rupture peptide and amide linkagesand ultimately disintegrate (dissolve) the hair (after several days) [ 74,121].Concentrated solutions of alkali halides (25–60%), after several days, produceextensive dimensional changes to hair [ 74,121]. Barnard and White [ 114] foundextensive swelling by potassium iodide, sodium bromide, lithium bromide, andlithium chloride solutions, but not for sodium chloride. Those halide salts thatproduce extensive swelling of human hair are believed to be capable of breakinghydrogen bonds that water alone is incapable of breaking. For additional details onthis subject, see the section on supercontraction in Chap. 4.9.9.5 Hair Swelling by Permanent Wave Agents
9.9.5 Hair Swelling by Permanent Wave AgentsShansky [ 173] developed a special cell to follow hair swelling under the lightmicroscope. He used this system to s tudy permanent-wave reactions withhuman hair and found that the reduction st ep produces an increase in diametralswelling which increases with increasing disulﬁde bond rupture [ 173,174].Shansky also found that rinsing with water, after reduction, produces additionalswelling. He attributed this effect to osmotic forces, since there is a lower saltconcentration outside the ﬁbers after r insing. Neutralization then reversesswelling. This de-swelling effect is c aused by the reformation of disulﬁdecross-links [ 173,175].Ekstrom [ 116] described a moving boundary be tween swollen and un-swollenﬁber as the reducing front penetrates the hair during permanent waving and9.9 Water (RH), pH and Solvents and the Dimensions of Hair 617
depilation. Keil [ 176] using the polarizing microscope noted a similar movingboundary in his studies on permanent waving. Wickett [ 177] studied the reductionof hair with sodium thioglycolate above pH 10 when diffusion of the mercaptaninto the hair is rate-controlling and de monstrated moving boundary kinetics.However, for reaction at lower pH values (below pH 9), the nature of this reactiondepends on the reactivity of the particul ar individual’s hair. For one individualwhose hair was highly reactive, the reaction followed pseudo-ﬁrst-order kinetics.In this situation, the permanent wave was reaction-controlled. However, foranother individual’s hair (difﬁcult-to-w ave hair) the reaction exhibited movingboundary kinetics.Powers and Barnett [ 174] found that a large excess of reducing solution at pH 10(for reduction times of 15 min or longer) produced swelling in excess of 200% and
effectively destroyed the hair. They also found that the amount of swellingincreased with increasing pH from 8 to 10. This effect is related to the increasingrate of disulﬁde rupture with increasing pH. Finally, these scientists indicated thatthe effectiveness of the neutralization step in permanent waving could be assessedby relating it to the swelling action of hair in water. In general, hair swellingmethods have been valuable for providing information about chemical alterationsto human hair, relevant to permanent wave reactions. For additional details seeChap. 4.9.9.6 Swelling Test for Hair DamageKlemm et al. [ 178] described a swelling test to assess hair damage by permanentwaves and bleaches. This test consists o f measuring hair ﬁber diameter swelling ina series of three solutions: the ﬁrst trea tment is water for 10 min; the second, 60%
lithium bromide for 60 min; and the third, water for 10 min. From an empiricalequation, numerical values of swelling be havior may be calculated. This methoddistinguishes between single and multi ple permanent waves and between singleand multiple bleaches on hair. It essentia lly compares swelling in water versuslithium bromide, one of the most effecti ve hydrogen bond breaking agents know.The results rely on the fact that the more damaged a hair ﬁber the more hydrogenbonds are capable of being broken by this powerful hydrogen bond breakingagent.9.10 Hair Fiber FrictionFriction is the force that resists motion when one body slides over another. Theclassical laws of friction were formulated by Leonardo da Vinci and later byAmontons, with whom they are generally associated. Amontons Law states that618 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
the frictional force necessary to slide one surface over another is proportional to thenormal load pressing the two surfaces together (W).Frictional force ¼mWThe proportionality constant ( m) is called the coefﬁcient of friction. The fric-tional coefﬁcient is generally independent of the area of contact. At low loads, whenthe ﬁber undergoes a large amount of deformation the true area of contact changessigniﬁcantly. Thus, at low loads, the area of contact affects the coefﬁcient offriction. The force necessary to initiate movement determines the coefﬁcient ofstatic friction (ms). The force necessary to maintain movement when the body is inmotion determines the coefﬁcient of kinetic friction ( mk).mkis almost always lessthanms.These laws of friction apply to dry, un-lubricated surfaces and to boundarylubricants (very thin solid or nonﬂuid ﬁlms separating the surfaces). But, theselaws do not apply to hydrodynamic lubricants [ 179], such as ﬂuid layers that
separate the moving surfaces (for example, engine-lubricating oils). Generally,lipid on the surface of the hair provides a reduction in friction. This is an experi-mental variable of concern to control. For example, by careful cleansing of the testsurfaces of the ﬁbers or by testing in surfactant solutions this variable may becontrolled. There are several theories attempting to explain friction. For discussionof these theories, see the book by Howell et al. [ 180],Friction in Textiles.Two important variables relevant to fri ction on hair are relative humidity (ormoisture content of the hair) and the nor mal load (W) pressing the two surfacestogether. It is helpful to consider fricti on on hair in terms of two conditions forrelative humidity and two conditions of load, thus forming the 2 /C22m a t r i xbelow.Low RH (60% RH or lower) High RH (in water)" High (g) Dry high load Wet high loadLoad Low (mg) Dry low load Wet low loadRelative humidity !
Relative humidity !The dry high-load condition is the state that simulates hair friction conditionsrelevant to dry combing or brushing of hair. The wet high-load condition is relevantto wet combing. On the other hand, the dry low-load condition is relevant to thosecritical hair-on-hair interactions involved in style retention and hair body. Robbins[181] described three different experimental conditions to characterize hair ﬁberfriction by these three relevant humidity-load conditions. These three approachesare summarized in the next section.9.10 Hair Fiber Friction 619
9.10.1 Methods for Measuring Friction on Hair FibersTwo different capstan methods (a ﬁber over a rod) have been used to measurefrictional coefﬁcients of single hair ﬁbers [ 182,183] at high load both in air (lowRH) and in aqueous media. The apparatus used by Schwartz and Knowles [ 182]involves draping a ﬁber with equal weights on each end over a cylinder. One weightis placed on a torsion balance to measure the frictional forces developed as thecylinder is moved against the ﬁber.The method of Scott and Robbins [ 183] involves attaching the root end of a hairﬁber to the load cell of a device such as an Instron tensile tester. The ﬁber is
weighted at the tip end and partially wrapped around two mandrels (these may berotated) but more relevant results are obtained when the mandrels are not rotated.The mandrels are attached to the crosshead. As the crosshead moves downward themandrels are rubbed against the ﬁber and the frictional load is recorded. In a capstansystem (such as this), the coefﬁcient of kinetic friction ( mk) may be calculated fromthe following expression:mk¼16olnT2T1where ø is the angle of wrap in radians, T 2is the tension after passing over the rod,and T 1is the tension before passing over the rod. This equation assumes that frictionis independent of load, a condition valid for the load ranges used in these twostudies of frictional effects on human hair. Scott and Robbins used a 1 g load (highload, on the tip end of the hair) small enough so that the total load (weight plusfrictional load) did not exceed the ﬁber yield point.
Different rubbing speeds (in the vicinity of 10 in. per minute or higher) do notappreciably change the friction coefﬁcient [ 183]. However, Robbins [ 181]demonstrated that friction increases with decreasing rubbing speed in the vicinityof 0.5 in. per minute and it appears to level near 0.05–0.02 in. per minute, probablyapproaching static friction. At these lower rubbing speeds, greater differences canbe demonstrated between treatments, especially on dry hair. Therefore, the pre-ferred laboratory conditions for simulating the actions involved in wet combing ofhair involve a load of approximately 1 g/ﬁber, with the ﬁber immersed in water, at alow rubbing speed in the vicinity of 0.02 in. per minute. To simulate dry combing,the preferred conditions are also a load of approximately 1 g per ﬁber, near 60%RH, and a low rubbing speed of approximately 0.02 in. per minute.Wrap angle changes produce signiﬁcant differences in friction, as indicated by
the capstan equation above. Thus, the friction coefﬁcient increases with increasingwrap angle. The above two friction methods measure coefﬁcients of kinetic frictionand the low rubbing speed system approaches static friction. Since Amontons lawstates that static friction is generally higher than kinetic friction, there is probably adirectional similarity between static and kinetic friction.620 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
Robbins [ 181] also developed a procedure for de termining dry static friction atlow load (in the milligram range) by modiﬁ cation of the incline plane ﬁber loopmethod of Howell and Mazur [ 184]. This procedure attem pts to measure thoseintimate ﬁber-ﬁber interactions associa ted with hair body and style retention. Theprocedure involves determining the angle of slip for a small hair ﬁber loop sittingon two parallel hair ﬁbers. Above 1 mg load , the friction coef ﬁcient decreasesvery slowly with increasing load. However, below 1 mg load, the friction coefﬁ-cient increases abruptly with decreasing load (see Fig. 9.29) .T h ed i a m e t e ro ft h eﬁber loop (in the vicinity of less than 2 c m) affects the friction coefﬁcient.Presumably this effect is due to scale disto rtion as the loop becomes progressivelys m a l l e rr e s u l t i n gi na ni n c r e a s ei nt h et r u e area of contact (A) as described by thisequation:F¼ASA¼true area of contact
equation:F¼ASA¼true area of contactS¼shear strength of materials in contactLarger hair ﬁber loops are recommended (in the vicinity of 5 cm diameter)providing a load of 1–2 mg, depending on ﬁber thickness. At low load (mg range),the ﬁber system is sensitive to cohesive/viscosity forces from thick layers ofproduct deposits, because the ﬁber system at such low loads has difﬁcultyploughing through thick viscous deposits. For example, a pomade-type combingaid (consisting of petrolatum and mineral oil) was evaluated and shown to dramati-cally increase the apparent friction coefﬁcient at low load due to the cohesive natureof the viscous pomade. However, when this same pomade was tested by a high-loaddry friction method, the friction coefﬁcient decreased relative to the untreatedcontrol ﬁbers. These effects show that this pomade will hold ﬁbers of an assemblyFig. 9.29 The directional nature of the frictional coefﬁcient of human hair and its variation with
load (at 60% RH)9.10 Hair Fiber Friction 621
in place better, because ﬁber movement at low-load forces (mg range) will beresisted by the cohesive forces of the viscous pomade ingredients. However, whenhigh-load forces are applied as in combing, a viscous product can act as a lubricantand thereby facilitate comb on hair and hair on hair movement. This experimentveriﬁes the need for both low- and high-load friction methods to develop a morecomplete understanding of hair product behavior. Other approaches to measureﬁber friction are described in the books by Howell et al. [ 180] and Meredith andHearle [ 185].9.10.2 Relative Humidity and FrictionAs indicated above, wet friction for human hair is higher than dry friction (seeTable 9.35). In addition, both static and kinetic friction and the differential frictioneffect increase with increasing RH, that is with increasing water binding by the hair.These same phenomena have been observed for wool ﬁber [ 186,187].9.10.3 Friction and Fiber Diameter
9.10.3 Friction and Fiber DiameterScott and Robbins [ 183] found that high-load friction is independent of hair ﬁberdiameter. This effect agrees with theory and with the results of Fishman et al. [ 188].However, Martin and Mittleman [ 189] reported a slight increase in friction withwool ﬁber diameter. For low-load hair on hair friction, the ﬁber diameter effect isdifﬁcult to test, because as ﬁber diameter increases, the load also changes and thusthe friction coefﬁcient changes.9.10.4 The Directional Friction EffectAs with most animal ﬁbers, human hair shows a directional friction effect, that is, itis easier to slide a surface over hair in a root-to-tip direction than in a tip-to root-direction (see Figs. 9.29 and9.30). This directional friction effect is useful fororienting hair ﬁbers for experimentation. For example, take a hair ﬁber between thethumb and foreﬁnger, and gently rub back and forth along the ﬁber axis. If rubbingTable 9.35 Frictioncoefﬁcients for hair on

is done correctly, the ﬁber will move in the direction of the root end or one will notethat it is easier to rub over the hair in the root to tip direction. Moistening the ﬁngersmakes this effect even more apparent, because the differential friction effectincreases with increasing moisture in the ﬁber surface layers.Table 9.36 illustrates this effect when rubbing hair ﬁbers against a hard rubbersurface in dilute shampoo and creme rinse solutions. Note that the differentialfriction effect is greater in the creme rinse solution than in the test shampoo. Thisis because the test creme rinse lowered the root-to-tip friction coefﬁcient more thanit lowered the tip to root coefﬁcient.Scott and Robbins [ 183] and Schwartz and Knowles [ 182] examined root to tiprubbing in more detail, because the friction coefﬁcient for root to tip rubbing islower than tip to root rubbing and it produces less abrasive damage to the hair.
Swift and Bews [ 190] suggested that totally or absolutely dry wool ﬁber (0%RH) does not display a differential friction effect (absolutely dry wool against aglass surface). However, Swift pointed out that absolutely dry wool is a hypotheti-cal condition. King [ 186] demonstrated a differential friction effect (DFE) from drywool against horn, and Robbins [ 181] for human hair against hard rubber. The DFEdoes become smaller with decreasing RH, but whether or not the DFE disappearsFig. 9.30 SEM of a knottedhair ﬁber, illustrating thecuticle cell surface structure.Note the raised scales causedby the severe bending stressof the knotted ﬁberTable 9.36 Directionalfriction effect for human hairat high load (Scott, privatecommunication)High cleaningshampoo ( mk)Cremerinse ( mk)Rubbing root to tip ( m1) 0.425 0.293Rubbing tip to root ( m2) 0.546 0.475Directional friction effect (DFE) 0.285 0.621DFE¼m2/C0m1m19.10 Hair Fiber Friction 623
completely at absolute zero RH is academic. Swift and Bews [ 190] proposed thefollowing explanation to account for the decreasing DFE with decreasing watercontent in animal hairs.The two major layers of cuticle cells, the exocuticle and endocuticle, may beexpected to behave differently with respect to moisture regain. The exocuticle,because of its high cross-link density, should not swell so readily as the endocuticle,with its paucity of cross-links and high density of ionic groups. Swelling of theendocuticle on regain could convert it to a gel-like structure which could contributeto the DFE in animal hairs [ 180,185,187,191].9.10.5 Mandrel and Comb Composition and Fiber FrictionBoth Scott and Robbins [ 183] and Schwartz and Knowles [ 182] found widevariation in the coefﬁcient of kinetic friction for rubbing human hair ﬁbers against
different mandrel compositions. Some of Schwartz’s results are summarized inTable 9.35. Most interesting are the relatively low values on aluminum, suggestinga beneﬁt for aluminum combs. However, Wolfram and Hambidge [ 192] determinedthat the frictional characteristics of combing materials are not a very importantfactor in hair combing. This result suggests that hair on hair friction the cause oftangles and snags is more important to combing forces than hair on comb friction.Experimentally, it is generally easier to test friction of hair against anothersubstrate than to test hair-on-hair friction. It is likely that the relative frictionaleffects of hair against rubber or another substrate will correlate well (but notperfectly) with hair-on-hair friction, as evidenced by the results of Table 9.35showing lower dry than wet frictional coefﬁcients for all substrates.9.10.6 Normal Room Temperatures do not Affect Hair Friction
Scott and Robbins [ 183] found that temperature changes from 75 to 110/C14F(~24–43/C14C) produced virtually no changes in the high-load friction coefﬁcient.Other temperature ranges have not been reported.9.10.7 Bleaching (Oxidation of Hair) Increases Hair FrictionScott and Robbins [ 183] demonstrated that bleaching hair increases hair ﬁberfriction. Furthermore, friction increases with increasing bleach damage. Thissame effect has been observed both at high load and at low load. The results ofTable 9.37, in “shampoo” illustrate this effect, while those in conditioner illustratethe effect of conditioners on bleached hair. These results suggest that the stronger624 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
interaction of bleached hair with cationic conditioner ingredients is consistent withthe higher concentration of ionized cysteic acid groups at or near the surface inbleached hair [ 53]. The inﬂuence of bleaching and its frictional effects on thecosmetic properties of hair are discussed in Chap. 10.9.10.8 Permanent Waving Increases Hair FrictionPermanent waving not only changes hair ﬁber curvature, but it also increases hairﬁber friction [ 182]. The inﬂuence of permanent waves on cosmetic hair assemblyproperties is discussed in Chap. 10.9.10.9 Shampoos and Hair FrictionTable 9.38 summarizes some of the data of Scott and Robbins [ 183] for the wetfriction coefﬁcients of shampoos at high load. The coefﬁcient of friction for hairﬁbers treated with the high conditioning shampoo is lower than for hair treated withthe high cleaning shampoo. This effect suggests easier wet combing by the condi-tioning shampoo and has been veriﬁed.9.10.10 Conditioners and Hair Friction
9.10.10 Conditioners and Hair FrictionFrom friction behavior versus concentration of different cationic types, Scott andRobbins [ 183] suggested three types of cationic conditioner ingredients. Table 9.39illustrates this behavior in which the cationics were tested by determining thefriction coefﬁcient of hair ﬁbers against hard rubber ﬁrst in the higher concentrationsolutions (0.1% and 0.01%) and then simply by changing solution to deionizedTable 9.37 Effect ofbleaching on hair ﬁberfriction [ 183] (high load)mkin shampoo mkin conditionerrinseUnmodiﬁed hair 0.249 0.2201/C2mild bleach 0.342 0.1903/C2mild bleach 0.427 0.193Table 9.38 Frictioncoefﬁcients by shampoos[183] (high load)Hair on hardrubber ( mk)High cleaning shampoo 0.342Experimental high conditioning shampoo 0.1559.10 Hair Fiber Friction 625
water, to simulate rinsing. For CTAB, the friction coefﬁcient decreased withconcentration from 0.1% to 0.01%. For a “simulated rinse” (0%), it increased,indicating that CTAB is not bound tightly to the hair ﬁber surface.SBDAC illustrates another type of behavior, where friction decreases withconcentration; however, on rinsing to 0% it remains low. Both IQ and DDACillustrate the third type of behavior, where the friction coefﬁcient is low under alltest conditions. These data suggest a point of superiority for DDAC and IQ overCTAB. The decrease in the friction coefﬁcient with concentration and with rinsingfor SBDAC is unexpected. These results indicate the necessity for thorough rinsingwith this ingredient for optimum conditioner performance.Scott and Robbins [ 183] tested CTAB above and below its critical micelleconcentration, using salt to promote micelle formation. No signiﬁcant differencewas found in the friction coefﬁcient, suggesting that molecular sorption rather than
micellar sorption occurs to affect the friction coefﬁcient in systems of this type. Foradditional discussion of conditioners and the effects of reduced ﬁber friction on hairproperties, see Chap. 10.9.11 Mechanical Fatiguing, Extension Cycling and Scale LiftingKamath et al. [ 193] of Textile Research Institute in Princeton tested mechanicalfatiguing of human hairs by employing loads of 20–40 grams (generally 30 g) for aﬁxed number of cycles up to 100,000. Controlled humidity and temperature is arequirement for this type of testing as for most hair ﬁber testing. At 30 grams load,the strain is generally just beyond the Hookean region and is similar to “some” ofthe strains encountered in combing and brushing of hair [ 194] where repetitive orcyclic stresses occur at very rapid strain rates. Mechanical fatiguing is essentiallyimpact loading hundreds to thousands of times [ 193–196]. A hair ﬁber with an
attached weight can be impacted either by fatiguing (many times) or against anotherobject such as another hair ﬁber or a comb tooth (once or a few times) and isdescribed in Chap. 10and in two publications by Robbins [ 14,195].Extension cycling on the other hand has been used by Gamez-Garcia [ 16] wherehe employed strains of 10–30% under conditions of controlled humidity andTable 9.39 Inﬂuence of cationic concentration and rinsing effects on hair friction [ 183]Concentration0.1%mk 0.01% mk 0%amkCetrimonium bromide (CTAB) 0.390 0.298 0.537Stearalkonium chloride (SBDAC) 0.450 0.394 0.298Distearyldimonium chloride (DDAC) 0.171 – 0.298Imidazolinium quaternary (IQ) 0.188 0.169 0.166aThis point was determined after the higher concentration (0.1%) simply by changing solution todeionized water, to simulate rinsing626 9 The Physical Properties of Hair Fibers
temperature, generally for 50–200 cycles. Gamez-Garcia found the most damagingeffects to the cuticle at low relative humidity produced microscopic damage withstrains as low as 10% stretch.These methods (fatiguing, extension cycling and impact loading) are relativelynew (compared to tensile testing) and they simulate “some” of the damagingactions and effects from combing and brushing. Tensile testing is useful forinvestigating changes to the cortex of the ﬁber from treatments or physical actions.But, tensile testing is not so meaningful in terms of simulating the stresses normallyencountered by hair ﬁbers on consumers’ heads because hair ﬁbers are not normallystretched 25–50% of their length or at exceedingly low strain rates as employed inmost tensile tests. Furthermore, the fact that cuticle damage cannot be detected bytensile testing is another important negative. However, torsional testing can reveal
cuticle damage. The following discussion illustrates some of the results from thesenewer test methods.Cyclic stretching and fatiguing of hair ﬁbers occurs in everyday groomingactions and these actions ultimately lead to cuticle deformation and cuticle frag-mentation (Figs. 9.31–9.35).Gamez-Garcia [ 16] demonstrated that cuticle cracks in the non-keratin regionscan be induced by only 10% extension at low humidity (Fig. 9.31) creating crackedand lifted scales. He also showed that the extent of crack formation depends on thenumber of cycles. Kamath et al. [ 193] observed similar ﬁndings for mechanicalfatiguing of hair ﬁbers. Figure 9.32 illustrates the effects of fatiguing on the cuticleand Figs. 9.33 and9.34 shows the effects on the cuticle and the cortex of hair byfatiguing followed by stretching the ﬁbers to break.Fig. 9.31 Scale lifting caused by extension cycling to 10% at 10% RH [ 16]: (a) to 50 cycles, ( b)t o

The process of cuticle loss or fragmentation was described in detail in Chap. 6.Amechanism was also presented to explain this phenomenon. Chemical or physicalattack to the cell membrane complex and the endocuticle weakens these vitalregions producing increased swelling and even cracks that accelerate the processesof fragmentation and in some cases catastrophic failure. Penetrating chemicals canenter damaged areas more rapidly. Certain chemicals either strengthen the ﬁber (notoften) or more likely produce scale lifting and/or distortion and in this mannereither inhibit or accelerate the process of cuticle degradation and scale removal.The next section of this manuscript describes the effects of penetrating ingredientson the cell membrane complex and the endocuticle and the consequences of theseactions using the techniques of mechanical fatiguing and extension cycling coupledwith microscopy.Fig. 9.35 Hair ﬁber chemically bleached with alkaline peroxide and then fatigued.

If cuticle cracks are formed by stretching or fatiguing and the ﬁbers are treatedwith water and dried, the scales sometimes return to their “normal” appearance at amicroscopic level. However, subsequent treatments (other than water) to cracked ordamaged scales can either inhibit further damage or accelerate cuticle fragmenta-tion. Even pre-treatments can affect fragmentation.Gamez-Garcia [ 16] determined that pre-treatment of hair ﬁbers with hydrogenbonding plasticizers such as glycerine or propylene glycol (without rinsing) inhibitsscale lifting from extension cycling. These effects may be similar to the effects ofpre-shampoo treatments with oils such as coconut oil which has been shown byRuetsch et al. [ 197] to reduce cuticle fragmentation.Hilterhaus-Bong and Zahn [ 198] demonstrated that intercellular lipids can beextracted from hair by multiple detergent washings. Gould and Sneath [ 199]
examined root and tip sections of scalp hair by transmission electron microscopy(TEM) and observed holes or vacancies in the thin cross-sections. These holes(cracks) were attributed to breakdown and removal of intercellular components byshampoos. Removal of parts of the cell membrane complex by shampoos willweaken this domain making the hair more susceptible to cuticle fragmentation.This effect is consistent with the ﬁnding in our laboratories that cuticle fragmenta-tion and protein loss (see Chap. 6) is greater in the tip ends of hair ﬁbers treated onlywith shampoos and no other cosmetic treatment.Polymer JR-400 when applied to fatigued or stretched hair inhibits cuticle scalelifting. This effect is illustrated by comparing Fig. 9.35 (bleached, fatigued controlﬁber) to Fig. 9.36(bleached, JR treated, fatigued). Note the breakage and crumbling
of the scales at the cuticle edges in the control versus the fewer broken scale edgesof the treated ﬁber of Fig. 9.36. This effect is illustrated further by comparingFigs. 9.37 (bleached, fatigued and extended control) and 9.38(bleached, JR treated,Fig. 9.36 Hair ﬁber chemically bleached with alkaline peroxide then treated with Polymer JR-400solution and then fatigued 100,000 times with a 30 g load.

fatigued and extended). Note the large difference in the cuticle scale lifting ofFig.9.37 versus that of the JR treated hairs in Fig. 9.38.Post treatment of extension cycled hair with 3% aqueous solutions of polymerssuch as a hydrolyzed wheat-polysiloxane copolymer or a protein-silicone copoly-mer inhibits scale lifting that can be induced by additional bending after extensioncycling (Fig. 9.39)[16]. On the other hand, polymers such as polyethylene-imine(3%) fail to prevent scale lifting from additional ﬁber extension. But, blow dryingof polyethylene-imine treated hair produces cuticle lifting and distortion (Fig. 9.40)[16].Fig. 9.37 Hair ﬁber chemically bleached with alkaline peroxide then fatigued 100,000 times witha 30 g load and then extended.

Inhibition or promotion of scale lifting and hair fragmentation by isolatedpolymers or ingredients can be informative in terms of helping to explain themechanism of ﬁber degradation from stretching, bending, torsion and abrasiveactions. However, such treatments are often of limited use in product formulationFig. 9.39 Both hair ﬁbers extension cycled 200 times to 20% extension at 10% RH and put intowater and knotted by Gamez-Garcia [ 16].Right : Fiber treated with 3% cystine polysiloxane priorto knotting.

Note the severe

studies, because the addition of other ingredients to make a ﬁnished and aestheticformulation often changes the nature and effects of the active ingredient on cuticlefragmentation or protein loss. For example, hair ﬁbers with a weakened cellmembrane complex from permanent waving and stretching when treated alternatelywith triethanol ammonium lauryl sulfate and stearalkonium chloride producedpronounced scale lifting and distortion. On the other hand, the addition of cetylalcohol (a common additive in cre `me rinses) to the stearalkonium chloride producesnoticeably less scale lifting and distortion.Certain shampoo formulations with cationic guar produce scale lifting. How-ever, other formulations with only small formula changes produce no detectablelifting or less protein loss. Thus the combination of ingredients in a formulation caneither retard penetration and/or deposition into the cuticle or alter the interactions of
an active ingredient with functional groups that are a part of the structure of hair andchange the effects on cuticle/hair damage.Hair ﬁbers with a weakened cell membrane complex/endocuticle are exceed-ingly sensitive to penetrating ingredients. Ingredients that penetrate into theseregions can either remove or breakdown non-keratin components or can depositand promote cuticle lifting and scale distortion. On the other hand, thosepenetrating ingredients that diffuse into the cell membrane complex-endocuticleand interact by bonding so as to either plasticize or provide adhesive bridges to the
weakened layers can strengthen the cuticle and make it more resistant to fragmen-tation and protein loss. Furthermore, scale lifting methodology (extension cyclingor fatiguing evaluated by microscopy and/or light scattering) is more effective fordistinguishing between these types of damage and repair than tensile or load-elongation methods which have not been shown to be capable of detecting changesin the cuticle.References1.

Chapter 10Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair AssemblyProperties and How These are Controlledby Single Fiber PropertiesAbstract Herein is an attempt to bridge the gap between consumer and scientistby deﬁning the more important consumer hair assembly properties (heads of hair,tresses, or wigs) describing how these properties are affected by changes fromcosmetic treatments to fundamental single ﬁber properties. The effects of changesin single ﬁber properties by chronological age for ﬁve different stages of one’s life isalso described in terms of how these ﬁber properties relate to and affect the importantconsumer hair assembly properties. The literature on hair breakage is also
summarized as a multifactorial phenomenon involving tangle formation with hairslooped over other hairs, severe bending deformations, highly localized stresses, andthe amount of water in the ﬁbers. The effects of hair curvature, ﬁber twists, knots, hairdamage and abrasive wear on hair breakage are also described. A new unpublishedsection describing split hairs found on the heads of consumers is described along withpreferred mechanisms for the formation of these different types of split hairs.10.1 IntroductionThis new Chapter deﬁnes and summarizes the literature on the more importantcosmetic hair assembly properties (CHAP) of human hair including, hair condition-ing, hair strength, hair breakage, split ends, ﬂyaway hair, luster or shine, combingease, hair body, style retention, manageability and hair handle or feel. Hair feelassessments include dryness-oiliness, clean-feel, conditioned-feel, softness andsmoothness, etc. are important assessments that are currently being addressed and
is summarized in the section entitled Hair Handle or Feel .Over the past several years these elusive cosmetic terms, hair conditioning, hairdamage, hair strength, hair body, manageability and moisturization have beendeﬁned in ways that have permitted progress to be made in terms of understandingthese properties and in stimulating new methods for their measurement. Therefore,C.R. Robbins, Chemical and Physical Behavior of Human Hair ,DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-25611-0_10, #Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012641
I decided to deﬁne these and other important CHAP all together in this Chapter.Some of these deﬁnitions are new; however, several have been taken or slightlymodiﬁed from the cosmetic literature including the following references [ 1–7] andsections of Chap. 8in previous editions.This Chapter also contains a summary of the hair literature on hair breakage andsome new information on the splitting of hairs that actually occurs on live heads.This information shows that splitting of hairs is accelerated by cosmetic treatmentsand sunlight exposure that involve free radical reactions on the cortex cell mem-brane complex of hair.Some of the more important cosmetic terms are deﬁned below including:Combing ease: the ease of aligning hair ﬁbers of a tress or hair assembly with acomb so the ﬁbers are essentially parallel [ 1,2].Frizziness: when the curvature of neighboring hairs of an assembly are not
synchronized (parallel) producing the appearance of disorder or disarray nearthe ends [ 3].Hair body: is primarily the apparent volume of an assembly of hair ﬁbers [ 1], but itis deﬁned in more detail on the next few pages.Relative scalp coverage or “Amount of Hair”: a new metric for the manner inwhich hair provides coverage to the scalp [ 7].Style retention: the ability of an assembly of hair ﬁbers to retain a style that it isplaced in for several hours after grooming (time limit is arbitrary, but longer thangrooming operations) [ 1].Manageability: the ease of putting hair into place and its temporary ability toremain in place during styling operations. See additional details below [ 4].Flyaway hair: the static ballooning of a hair assembly at a speciﬁc RH by controlledcombing, brushing[ 1] or rubbing.Luster: a scientiﬁc term to measure consumers’ assessment of hair shine.Hair breakage : is only relevant as it relates to and explains breakage that occurs on
the head of consumers. The most relevant tests for breakage are those that countor weigh the hairs that are broken in hair combing or brushing tests or those thatcorrelate closely with that type of test.In addition to the deﬁnitions above, deﬁnitions for Hair Conditioning, Hairdamage, Hair Strength, Hair Body, Moisturization and additional details for Man-ageability are provided below:A good working deﬁnition for Hair Conditioning is based on the action orfunction expected by consumers for this type of product. Thus, a hair conditioner isan ingredient or a product, that when applied to hair in its recommended useprocedure and concentration improves the combability relative to appropriatecontrols. For testing an ingredient in a product, the control should be a productcontaining all ingredients except the potential active. In the case of a product, thecontrol should be a cleansing medium such as 12% sodium lauryl sulfate or sodiumlaureth-2 sulfate in water.
This deﬁnition does not say that combability is the only property of a hairconditioner, but it deﬁnes combability as the “acid test” or the “price of entry”642 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
for a hair conditioner. Different combing tests to assess hair conditioning aredescribed in the section entitled, Combing Ease . Market research studies withconsumers and current scientiﬁc literature are consistent with the above deﬁnition.The advantage of this deﬁnition is that it permits ease of combing a method that canbe used for reproducible measurement to be used to study and to improve hairproducts for conditioning.Hair Damage is deﬁned and described in detail in Chap. 6in the section entitled,Damage to Hair from Shampoos, Grooming and Weathering .Hair Strength maybe deﬁned as the ability to resist hair breakage by grooming actions and is deﬁnedfurther in the section entitled, Breakage of Hair during Grooming Actions in thisChapter. Methods to assess these important properties are also described in thesesame sections.Hair Body has been deﬁned by Robbins [ 1] as thickness or apparent volume of a
hair assembly, involving sight and touch for assessment. This deﬁnition does notlend itself to one simple method for measurement, however, it does help to improveour understanding of this important hair property and it has permitted severalscientiﬁc tests to be proposed that correlate with hair body. For a more completediscussion on the utility of this deﬁnition, see the section on Hair Body in thisChapter.Manageability [4] involves the ease of arranging hair in place and its temporaryability to stay in place during the grooming process; that is while arranging hair inplace. Long-term effects on hair behavior (after one is ﬁnished arranging the hair inplace) are actually style retention and not manageability. Manageability is an evenmore complex consumer assessment than hair body. It is such an inclusive term thatit cannot be measured by one single procedure. Robbins et al. [ 4] recommended
considering this important cosmetic property in terms of its component ﬁberassembly properties, such as different types of manageability that can be morereadily visualized and measured. Manageability is concerned with:Arranging hair in place (combing/brushing),Keeping hair in place (style retention during styling), andFlyaway hair.Therefore, the suggestion was made [ 4] to consider these three types of man-ageability to permit measurement and scientiﬁc evaluation, rather than the singleelusive term manageability. The section on manageability (later in this chapter)explains how to prioritize and use methods relevant to these three types ofmanageability.Moisturization of hair is another important cosmetic term that has been
misunderstood in the past. Because this word is derived from moisture, somejump to the conclusion that moisturization should relate to the water content ofthe ﬁbers. Actually moisture in hair is a scientiﬁc or technical term determined by theamount or percentage of water in hair and it can be measured, see the section in Chap.9entitled, “ Water (RH), pH and Solvents and the Dimensions of Hair ”. On the otherhand, moisturization is a consumer (ist) term not a scientiﬁc term. Davis and Stofel[5] described the consumers’ perception of moisturized hair vs. the actual water10.1 Introduction 643
content. These scientists [ 5] demonstrated that the consumers’ perception ofmoisturized hair does not correlate positively with the amount of water in hair, butit does correlate with consumers’ perception of smoothness of hair. For example,trained panelists were asked to rate hair tresses for moisturized hair equilibrated at15% RH vs. the same type tresses at 80% RH when the tresses were brought togetherrapidly at 45% RH. The hair tresses that had been equilibrated at 80% RH werejudged to be less moisturized even though they were found to contain higher watercontent at the time of evaluation. The apparent discrepancy here is that the hair withthe higher water content has a higher friction coefﬁcient and feels rougher.These scientists also asked panelists to rate shampooed hair vs. hair treated withshampoo plus conditioner for% moisturization. The conditioner treated hair wasjudged as more moisturized by a large margin even though the samples had
identical water content at the time of evaluation. Additional related experimentswere run demonstrating conclusively that the consumers’ perception of mois-turization is not at all related to the water content of the hair but to smoothnessand softness. Therefore, the hair feel involving smoothness or ﬁber friction isclearly a more reliable estimate of the consumers’ perception of moisturization ormoisturized hair than the actual water content of the ﬁbers.The above deﬁnitions of hair conditioning, hair damage, hair strength, hair body,manageability and moisturization, in all cases, do not provide a single method tomeasure these properties; however, they do permit a better understanding betweenscientist and consumer and a better overall understanding of these importantconsumer hair assembly properties. Therefore, these deﬁnitions will permit scienceto move forward to improve these important hair properties for consumers.10.2 Combing Ease
10.2 Combing EaseAs indicated earlier, combing ease may be deﬁned as the ease of aligning ﬁbers ofan assembly with a comb so that they are essentially or more parallel. Combing easemay be considered in terms of a combination of single-ﬁber properties or treated asan assembly property. Robbins and Reich [ 2] conducted a very large study relatingquantitative combing behavior to the single-ﬁber properties of curvature, friction,stiffness, and diameter for straight, wavy, and very curly hair. These different hairtypes were each treated with a shampoo detergent (sodium lauryl sulfate), a long-chain quaternary ammonium compound (stearalkonium chloride), a commercialpomade (from mineral oil and petrolatum), and a hair bleach (peroxide/persulfatesystem).In their analysis of combing ease, Robbins and Reich [ 2] demonstrated that
combing forces can be quantitatively deﬁned by the square of the ﬁber curvaturewhile considering only linear terms for friction and ﬁber stiffness as in this equationfor 3 g tresses of 10 in. hair:644 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
log PCL ¼0:0057 C2þ1:48 F/C00:05 Sþ1:66PCL¼Peak combing load ;C¼curvature ;F¼friction ;S¼stiffnessr2¼0:96;p<0:0001Fiber diameter did not provide a signiﬁcant contribution to combing forces(because diameter correlates with stiffness). Fiber friction was determined by acapstan method measuring friction of hair ﬁbers over a hard rubber mandrel at ahigh load of 1 g per ﬁber [ 2].The above quantitative combing expression suggests that when hair is curly tohighly coiled as for curly African American hair or hair permanent waved on smallrollers, curvature tends to dominate combing behavior and changes in friction andstiffness play only a minor role leading to the C2hypothesis of Robbins. However,when curvature is low as for wavy to straight hair of all types, for example, Curltypes I, II and III (by the STAM system, see Chap. 9) such as most Caucasian orAsian hair or even wavy to straightened African hair, friction plays the major role
with only a small contribution from ﬁber stiffness. This conclusion was conﬁrmedby regression analysis of the data for only wavy and straight hair showing thatcurvature effects are not signiﬁcant with hair of low curvature as in average Asianor Caucasian hair or straightened African American hair.In an unpublished part of this same project naturally curly African American hairfrom several female panelists was examined. This hair was cut directly at the scalp,and tresses were made from it. Its combing behavior compared to the combingbehavior of curly to highly coiled steam set Caucasian hair (two different lots ofdiffering curvatures). Both types of hair were reasonably close to the combingvalues predicted by a combing equation involving the square of the ﬁber curvature.The results of this latter study are in agreement with what is essentially the reverseexperiment by Epps and Wolfram [ 8]. These scientists concluded that, “straightening
of Black hair whether by chemical (relaxers) or physical (hot combing), results in hairwhose assembly behavior is indistinguishable from Caucasian hair”. Robbins actu-ally straightened some of the naturally curly African American hair using a commer-cial alkaline straightener and conﬁrmed that the combing forces for hair tresses fromthis hair were similar to that of tresses made from wavy Caucasian hair and inagreement with values predicted by a combing equation.The work from these two different laboratories conﬁrms that using very curlyhighly elliptical hair from African Americans (ellipticity ¼1.76) and very curlyhair of Caucasians of low ellipticity (ellipticity ¼1.38) that the longitudinal shape(hair ﬁber curvature or curliness) is the primary factor governing combing forcesand not the elliptical cross-sectional shape of the ﬁbers.Robbins and Reich also demonstrated that the primary reason the combing
forces are lower for wet curly hair vs. dry curly hair is an effect on ﬁber curvature.Wetting out the hair in a tress or an assembly actually uncurls the ﬁbers to somedegree decreasing the ﬁber curvature. This water straightening in high curvaturehair is sufﬁcient to provide a signiﬁcant decrease in combing forces in agreementwith the values found by quantitative combing.10.2 Combing Ease 645
Table 10.1describes how “changes” in the more important ﬁber properties affectcombing ease. This table suggests that increasing ﬁber curvature, friction or staticcharge will each make hair more difﬁcult to comb. Fiber length cannot be changedby cosmetic treatments. On the other hand, increasing ﬁber stiffness, diameter, orcohesive forces will make hair easier to comb as conﬁrmed by the study of Robbinsand Reich [ 2].Table 10.1 indicates that curvature has the most impact on combing forces.
When the curvature changes are relatively small and the ﬁbers are straight to wavy,the curvature effect on combing forces is small, but at higher curvatures the effecton combing forces increases until it becomes dominant. Fiber friction and stiffnessalso contribute to combing behavior. The effect of these two variables becomesmore important as curvature decreases and they are most important when the hairis relatively straight. Fiber diameter was not signiﬁcant in the quantitative studyby Robbins and Reich [ 2] because it is collinear with and contained in stiffness.Increasing ﬁber curvature or ﬁber friction makes combing more difﬁcult asexpected (see Table 10.1). However, increasing ﬁber stiffness results in lower
combing forces. Pomades and other oily or wax-containing conditioning productsare used in leave on products and large amounts of these materials, are left on thehair surface. These low level cohesive forces serve to lower combing loads. Thiseffect occurs because these ingredients’ inhibit the reformation of entanglements asthe comb traverses through the hair. Thus, cohesive ingredients facilitate combingby helping to keep the ﬁbers more parallel.10.2.1 Methods to Evaluate Combing EaseQualitative combing of tresses in replicate and evaluation of the data by nonpara-metric statistics can be a powerful tool when properly applied. This procedureprovides a fast, sensitive, and reproducible method for the development of products.However, quantitative instrumental methods have also been useful [ 9–12]. Basi-
cally, these methods consist of attaching a tress or swatch of hair to a strain gaugesuch as the load cell of an Instron tensile tester and measuring the forces and/orwork required to move a comb through the tress under controlled conditions.Table 10.1 How single ﬁber properties relate to combing ease [ 2]Increase in these ﬁber properties makescombing easierIncrease in these ﬁber properties makes combingmore difﬁcultStiffness CurvatureaDiameterbFrictionCohesion LengthStatic charge (chargeability)cNote: Fiber length is not changed by cosmetic treatmentsaA relatively large effect, and the effect increases with increasing curlinessbRelatively small effectcA relatively small effect is predicted646 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
Figure 10.1 represents a schematic of typical wet and dry combing force curvesfor a single comb system with relatively straight hair such as Curl types I, II or III.Note the high end peak force for the dry combing vs. the wet combing and therelatively high mid-length force for wet vs. dry combing. Analysis of combing forcecurves tells us that dry combing reveals tip end conditioning, and tip damage, alongwith short segment breakage better than wet combing. However, wet combing isbetter for revealing longer segment breakage and conditioning over the mid-lengthportion of the ﬁber.Figure 10.2 represents a schematic of typical dry combing force curves for verycurly hair; for example, Curl type VI or higher vs. relatively straight hair, such asCurl type I or II. Note the extremely large differences in the relative combingforces. The curves for Fig. 10.2 were drawn to represent combing forces where the
same type comb is used with both hair types. In practice, this would not be the casebecause the person with Curl type VI or higher will use a comb with wider spacesbetween the teeth or a pick.An interesting modiﬁed version of this test is the one by Kamath and Weigmann[12] that involved a double comb system wherein the combs are about 100 mmapart. With this system, the ﬁrst comb helps to remove snags while the second combmeasures the hair on hair plus hair on comb rubbing forces. Figure 10.3 is aschematic representing the combing forces for a double comb system. In a singleor double comb system, the mid-length combing loads or the forces or work ofcombing (total area under the curve) are related to long segment breakage. On theother hand, the end peak force is related more to short segment breakage.An alternative approach to the determination of combing forces is the raspinessmethod of Waggoner and Scott [ 11].

10.2.2 Treatment Effects on Combing EaseBoth permanent waving and bleaching make hair more difﬁcult to comb [ 2,10].Permanent waving increases both ﬁber curvature and inter-ﬁber friction [ 2], pri-mary factors that make hair more difﬁcult to comb (see Table 10.1).In the case of bleaching, the primary factor is the friction increase [ 2,13]. Thereis no measurable curvature change in bleaching [ 2]. Stiffness [ 2] and diameter [ 2]changes are also negligible from bleaching. In contrast to permanent waves andbleaches, conditioners [ 9,10,13] and some conditioner sets make hair comb easierby providing a decrease in inter-ﬁber friction. Chargeability [ 13,14] may also
decrease, thus helping to improve dry combing. Pomades decrease ﬁber friction andincrease low-level cohesive forces between hairs. This cohesive effect helps toinhibit the formation of entanglements beneath the comb as it travels through thehair. At the same time it helps to keep the ﬁbers parallel after each comb stroke.Thus, cohesive forces from oily ingredients make hair comb easier.Shampoos are a category with wide vari ability because these products canmake hair either easier or more difﬁcult t o comb (Ross, private communication).High-cleaning shampoos with anionic surfa ctants remove surface oils, increasinginter-ﬁber friction (Chap. 9) and thereby make clean hair more difﬁcult tocomb than greasy hair. However, certain conditioning shampoos deposit ingre-dients onto the hair surface and decrease ﬁber friction, making hair easier tocomb.Shampoo ingredients [ 13,14] can also alter the chargeability of the hair. For
example, high-cleaning sh ampoos remove surface oils and deposit small amountsof anionic surfactant onto the hair, thus increasing chargeability. On the otherhand, some conditioning shampoos lubric ate the hair surface, providing easiercombing and at the same time decreasing c hargeability, leading to less ﬂyawayand easier dry combing. Other conditioning shampoos deposit conditioners thatimprove wet combing, but they increase ﬂyaway hair demonstrating that thenature of the deposit is critical to char geability and to static charge. Changes inﬁber stiffness, curvature, and diameter by current shampoos are negligible.Therefore, changes in these propertie s are not relevant to combing effects bycurrent shampoos.10.3 Breakage of Hair During Grooming ActionsResearch shows that methods such as combing hair and collecting the brokenfragments and either counting or weighing the broken hairs [ 15–20] is the best
approach to measuring or estimating hair strength. Abrasion to break [ 17] which hasalso been called ﬂex-abrasion by Leroy et al. [ 18] and impact loading [ 19] are morerelevant than tensile testing to hair breakage during grooming because they relate10.3 Breakage of Hair During Grooming Actions 649
more to the actual strength of hair ﬁbers under the stresses of abrasion, bending and/or impact actions. These methods will be considered in this section.Abrasion resistance and the resistance to break under abrasive stresses (ﬂex-abrasion) are methods that should receive more attention in the future because oftheir closer relationship to some, but not all of the stresses that actually damage hairand ultimately lead to hair breakage during grooming actions. The apparatus builtby Textile Research Institute of Princeton, NJ under the guidance of Sandhu andRobbins [ 17] illustrates this type of test procedure, see Fig. 10.4. Rubbing hairﬁbers to break on this apparatus is capable of differentiating between some condi-tioning shampoos.Furthermore, work by Swift et al. [ 20] suggested improvement in the sensitiv-i t yo ft h i sm e t h o db e y o n dt h i se a r l i e rw o r k . This system merits further investiga-
tion, because of the relevance of rubbing , bending and compressive actions toeveryday hair grooming/hair wear and ﬁ ber breakage. The protein loss methodmeasures cuticle and cortical fragment ation damage and is a measure of abrasionresistance and dissolution; however, it is not a measure of catastrophic failure ofhair ﬁbers.Fig. 10.4 Schematic illustrating an instrument developed by TRI Princeton and S.

10.3.1 Evidence that Hairs Don’t Break from Tensile Elongationby Combing or BrushingThere are several important papers in the scientiﬁc literature on the fracturing andbreakage of human hair ﬁbers [ 15,19–29]. However, there is relevant literature thatraises questions as to how relevant tensile test conditions are for simulating or forpredicting hair breakage on live heads [ 21,22,25,28,29] or from combing orbrushing human hair tresses in the laboratory.Contrary to a superﬁcial assessment, most hair ﬁber breakage that occurs duringcombing or brushing does not result from simple tensile elongation. Hamburger,Morgan and Platt in 1950 [ 21] demonstrated that the load to pull Caucasian hairsout of the scalp was about 45% of the load required to break hair ﬁbers at 65% RH.Subsequently, Berthiaume et al. [ 22] published results that the pullout load forCaucasian hair is about 40–45 g (slightly higher than that of Hamburger et al. [ 21]),
for African hair 30–35 g and for Asian hair 60–65 g. Back calculating the averageload to break at 65% RH from the breaking stress for these three different types ofhair provides breaking loads for average Caucasian hair at about 76 g, for averageAfrican hair at 73 g, while average Asian hair should be more than 100 g because ofits larger area of cross-section. Therefore hairs must be damaged extensively orthey will pull out before breaking by tensile elongation; however, an alternative isthat hairs must break by another mechanism.An equally important factor to consider is the percentage extension to break forhair ﬁbers at 65% RH which is about 50% for Caucasian and Asian hair and about40% for African type hair at 65% RH (discounting premature failure) and evengreater at higher humidity. Hair on the head just does not stretch to this extentbefore breaking.10.3.2 Hair Fibers Bend and Loop Around Other Hairs Forming
Tangles Which Break Hairs by High Localized Forcesfrom Pulling a Comb or Brush Through a TangleCombing and brushing hair of Curl types I–III (by the STAM procedure) havebeen studied more systematically than hi gher Curl types and have been shown toprovide two types of breakage, short segment breaks (less than 2.54 cm) andlonger segment breaks. Brown and Swift [ 29] examined the arrangements of hairﬁbers in snags while combing tresses in a sc anning electron mi croscope to try tounderstand more fully how hair ﬁbers break during combing. These scientistsconcluded that hair ﬁbers loop over other hairs (see Fig. 10.5) and that hair on hairinteractions with severe bending actions are involved in hair breakage duringgrooming.10.3 Breakage of Hair During Grooming Actions 651
Robbins [ 19,26] studied hair breakage by combing hair tresses and examiningphotographs of snags of hair ﬁbers in combs. The resultant hair ﬁber arrangementsprovided support to the evidence and the conclusions of Brown and Swift thatbreakage involves hair on hair interactions (see Fig. 10.6) where hairs loop andbend over comb teeth and over other hairs to provide sites for hair on hair breakagethrough highly localized forces on impact while pulling through a tangle. Further-more, in combing experiments broken fragment size related to the site of highercombing forces in combing force curves suggesting that breakage occurs primarilyat or near the hair to comb interface.Even though these experiments were on Curl types I–III, it is likely that Curltypes IV–VIII break similarly because the more highly coiled the hair the morelooping and entanglements and higher combing forces and as we shall see breakageincreases with combing forces. In addition, Robbins and Kamath [ 28] demonstrated
an increase in breakage with hair ﬁber curvature corresponding to higher combingforces with higher curvature.Fig. 10.5 Small tress combed in the SEM showing hairs looped around other hairs by Brown andSwift [ 29] (Reprinted with permission of the Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists)Fig. 10.6 Hairs wrappedaround comb teeth and otherhairs in a snag [ 27] (Reprintedwith permission of the Journalof the Society of CosmeticChemists)652 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
10.3.3 Hair Fibers by Combing or Brushing Break into Shortand Longer SegmentsEvidence suggests that longer segment breaks (generally longer than 2.54 cm)occur primarily by one hair ﬁber bending over or wrapping around another hair(as illustrated in Fig. 10.6) and impact loading [ 19]. Furthermore, breakage bybending and impact loading occurs at a hair to hair contact point with essentially noincrease in hair length (strain) as compared to normal tensile loading which requireslarge strain increases [ 19,28–30]. On the other hand, short segment breaks (lessthan 2.54 cm) involve end wrapping of the distal ends of hairs about comb teeth orbrush bristles [ 19,26–28], see Fig. 10.7. This action at the ﬁber ends (especially inthe dry state) increases the end peak force and with continued abrasive damage tothe ends produces an increasing number of short segment breaks [ 26–28]. Theformation of entanglements is a critical determinant for both long and short
segment breaks including hair on hair and hair on comb entanglements and abrasionis more important to short segment breaks than long segment breaks.10.3.4 Hair Breakage Increases with Hair Fiber CurvatureCombing forces increase with the second power of hair ﬁber curvature as shown byRobbins and Reich [ 2]. The middle portion of the combing curve and the work ofcombing relate more to long segment breaks, while the end peak force relates moreto short segment breaks.Robbins and Kamath [ 28] compared the number of short and long segmentbreaks by combing hair tresses that had been permanent waved into Curl type IIand Curl type III conﬁgurations. These scientists found large increases in both thenumber of short and long segment breaks with increasing curvature. The increase inFig. 10.7 Ends of hair ﬁberswrapped around comb teeth ina snag [ 28] (Reprinted withpermission of the Journal ofthe Society of CosmeticChemists)10.3 Breakage of Hair During Grooming Actions 653
the long segment breaks are due to more snags that occur from entanglementshigher up in the tress produced by higher curvature. Even though the number oflong and short segment breaks increased with curvature, the number of longsegment breaks increased more than the number of short breaks.The effect of hair ﬁber curvature on ﬁber breakage is well known amongconsumers, because grooming devices were developed centuries ago to help com-pensate for curvature effects. For example, combs with small teeth and narrowspacing are normally used for short straight hair, while combs with larger teeth andwider spacing are normally used for hair of medium curvature. On the other hand,combs with very wide spacing called picks are used with hair of high curvature suchas Curl types V through VIII or even for some persons with Curl type IV.10.3.5 Curly Hair Forms Knots Which Also Break on Impactat the Site of the KnotKhumalo et al. [ 31] examined a large number of broken and pulled out hair ﬁbers
from two Africans (from South Africa). This hair was most likely one of the higherCurl types between V and VIII. Two Asian and two Caucasian volunteers were alsoon this panel. These panelists had never used chemical treatments on their hair. Thevolunteers shampooed and combed their hair (using their usual combs or picks) for4 days in a row and collected the hairs each day from the combings. At thebeginning of the experiment, the average hair length of the African hair was5 cm, for the Caucasians 22 cm and for the Asians 25 cm. Since the two Africanshad not cut their hair for more than 1 year and since the growth rate is about 13 cmper year, these facts testify to the high rate of breakage from high stresses, thefragility and the deformations imposed on highly coiled African hair by groomingactions.The total number of hairs collected was, 1,163 from the Africans, 464 from theCaucasians and 200 from the Asians. Ra ndom samples of 100 hairs (or the total
number of hairs) from each person for eac h day were examined visually, by lightmicroscopy and by SEM. For the Africans, 35% of the hairs had bulbs. Therefore,these hairs were pulled out of the scalp by grooming actions leaving 65% brokenhairs. For the Caucasians, 85% of the hairs were pulled out and 15% broken.Ninety two percent of the hairs from the A sians were pulled out, providing only8% broken hairs from the Asians. These sc ientists also observed that 13.3% of theAfrican hairs examined had knots. This average was relatively consistent eachday providing 106 knots in 800 hairs over t he 4 day period. This knot formationcontrasted to only one knot found in the hair of 464 Caucasian hairs and no knotsin 200 Asian hairs.These scientists proposed that knot formation in the highly coiled African hair isinvolved in breakage of some curly to highly coiled hairs. Robbins [ 26]
demonstrated that hairs in a knot under light impact loads break much more readily654 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
than unknotted hairs and the break forms at the knot. The severe bending in the knotproduces extensive elongation and compression over a very short segment of theﬁber making it more susceptible to breaking. These results conﬁrm once again theimportance of bending actions to hair breakage described by Swift and Brown [ 29].So, highly coiled hair ﬁbers such as Curl types IV–VIII tend to form knots andmany break through this mechanism [ 19,31]. And, the more highly coiled the hairthe higher the propensity for knot formation. So, some curly hairs do form knots andbreak by impact at the site of the knot, however, knots generally account for a smallpercentage (probably a maximum of about 13–26%) of the broken hairs.10.3.6 Hair Chemically or Physically Damaged Breaks Easierthan Non-Damaged HairChemical damage by perms (Chap. 4), bleaches (Chap. 5), permanent dyes Chap. 5[32], straighteners (Chap. 4)[33] and sunlight exposure (Chap. 5)[34] weaken hair
and increase inter-ﬁber friction leading to more tangle formation and more break-age. On the other hand, hair conditioners make hair comb and brush easier and havebeen shown to produce less breakage [ 27] (see Table 10.3 in Section 10.4.2 entitledCauses of Split Hairs and Split Ends).Relative humidity or the amount of water in the ﬁbers also affects combingforces and hair breakage [ 27]. Epps and Wolfram [ 8] demonstrated that the work ofcombing of highly coiled African hair is lower wet than dry, but the reverse holdsfor wavy to straight Caucasians hair where the combing forces are higher wet thandry [27,35].Physical damage or wear by abrasion [ 22,27] occurs from grooming devices
such as combs, picks or brushes and to some extent a fatiguing action. Wear byabrasion occurs over the entire ﬁber but more near the ﬁber tip ends because of alonger residence time, but even more so by high end peak forces when combing orbrushing hair dry [ 22] as evidenced by examination of many of the smallerfragments of short segment breaks [ 22,27].10.3.7 Hair Fibers with Twists Contain Flaws and Can BreakPrematurelyAs indicated earlier, the work of Kamath, Hornby and Weigmann [ 24] showed“premature failure” (breakage occurring at 20% extension or less) on 22% of thehair ﬁbers from one African American male. In addition, 17% of the ﬁbers brokewithin 8% extension at 65% RH. These scientists concluded that premature failuregenerally occurred in a region of twist. Interestingly, premature failure virtuallydisappeared when the African American ﬁbers were wet with only about 2%10.3 Breakage of Hair During Grooming Actions 655
breakage within 33% extension [ 24]. So, premature failure for African type hair isprimarily a dry state phenomenon.This particular African hair examined by Kamath et al. [ 24] had a very highellipticity (1.89) suggesting it is of Curl type VII–VIII. In addition, the load to breakfor this type of hair in the 3–20% strain area (the yield region) would be one-half orless of the average load to break at 65% RH and very close to the pull out load.Nevertheless, it is still likely that this type of hair breaks more frequently frombending than stretching stresses as suggested by Brown and Swift [ 29], that is, itwould more likely break by bending and impacting over another hair [ 19,26–28]o rby severe bending and deformation in a knot [ 18,31] rather than by tensile loading.In a few instances it is possible that tensile breakage could occur with this type ofhair. The wet breaking stress is lower for curly hair, therefore, dry breakage for
highly coiled African type hair should be more severe than wet breakage because ofthe higher grooming forces in the dry state [ 2,35]. The fact that premature failureoccurs in the dry state and it is virtually eliminated in the wet state and the ﬁbers aremore extensible when wet [ 36] are other reasons favoring dry state breakage forhighly coiled hair.10.3.8 Hair Breakage Correlates with Combing and BrushingForces and the Location of the Break on the FiberCorresponds to Where the Higher Combing Forces OccurAccumulated data from condi tioned vs. shampooed hair [ 27], bleachedvs. unbleached Caucasian hair [ 27] and comb stroke length comparing brokenhairs vs. combing loads (Crawford, pr ivate communication) shows that hairbreakage increases with combing forces. Pearsons’s non-parametric correlationtest of these data provides a signiﬁcant correlation for this effect. Furthermore,Kamath and Weigmann [ 12] observed that wetting and combing Caucasian hair
tresses provides a large increase in the mid-length force and at the same time adecrease in the end peak force compared with combing hair dry (65% RH). A fewyears later, Robbins and Kamath [ 27] observed more short segment breaks in dryvs. wet combing for Caucasian hair, but more long segment breaks in wetcombing. Furthermore, we have shown in our own laboratories that cross cuttinghair and combing it dry vs. a tapered cut provides even higher end peak forces andmore short segment breaks (see Table 10.4 in section 10.4.2 entitled Causes ofsplit hairs and split ends). These results conﬁrm that combing forces correlatewith hair breakage but more importantly t h el o c a t i o no nt h eﬁ b e rw h e r eb r e a k soccur during combing actually correspon ds to where higher combing forces occur
in combing force curves. In other words, mid-length combing forces correspondto long segment breakage and the end peak force corresponds to short segmentbreakage. This relationship suggest s that hairs break near the hair to combinterface in tangles.656 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
10.3.9 Fatiguing and Hair BreakageEvans and Park [ 37] suggested that fatiguing is the primary reason for hair break-age. On the other hand, Kamath and Robbins [ 15] considered the prior literature onhair breakage and suggested that hair breakage is a multifactorial phenomenon asdescribed above involving looping, bending and breakage by highly localizedstresses generated from impact during combing or brushing through a tangle.Fatiguing occurs primarily between the root section of the ﬁber and the brush orcomb when the combing device encounters a snag, but only on the ﬁbers undertension in that snag and when the same ﬁbers are under tension on thousands of repeat
cycles because low cycle fatiguing is deﬁned as less than 50,000 cycles. If weconsider fatiguing as two to millions of cycles of highly variable stresses then itcovers virtually every event. But, thousands of fatiguing cycles in exactly the samespot on the same ﬁber happens to only a low percentage of the ﬁbers in the comb orthe brush. So, fatiguing is a lower probability process than for a single hair under hightension to be impacted once or even a few times and broken. It is likely that in manycases hairs are damaged or even weakened by a fatiguing action (especially near thetips), however in most cases catastrophic failure occurs from a high localized impactof one hair bent over another in the damaged or undamaged region of the ﬁber.Evans and Park [203] used Weibull statistics to calculate the shape parameter
and the characteristic life for virgin and bleach damaged hair, and hair treated withconditioners. The deﬁnition of the characteristic life for hair breakage in theirexperiment is the number of brush strokes necessary to break 63.2% of the ﬁbers.For virgin hair, the characteristic life is 55.2 million brush strokes. But, for the samehair after conditioning it increases to 1.04 billion brush strokes. But the data forthese huge numbers are based on only 10,000 brush strokes when only 1.6% of theﬁbers broke (326 of 20,000) as compared to 12,640 ﬁbers corresponding to theirdeﬁnition of characteristic life. These characteristic life values are so large relativeto the actual data that they are of questionable reliability. For additional concernsabout the application of Weibull statistics to hair breakage data, see the paper byKamath and Robbins [ 15].Therefore, the fracture mechanism based on ﬂaw propagation by fatiguing in
real brushing and combing situations requires thousands of cycles. So, fatiguingactions on the same region of the same ﬁber may occur with a few ﬁbers, but itcannot be the primary cause of hair breakage especially for long segment breaks asshown above and in the following section.10.3.10 Where Hair Fibers Break Favors a Mechanism InvolvingHigh Localized StressesWhere hair ﬁbers break (along the length of each ﬁber) during combing andbrushing corresponds very closely to the higher combing forces in combing force10.3 Breakage of Hair During Grooming Actions 657
curves as described above. This fact supports the mechanism of Robbins andKamath [ 15] that involves high localized stresses and a few impacts rather thanthousands of cyclic stresses for the fatigue mechanism of Evans and Park [ 37].In the fatiguing process (primarily in the elastic and/or plastic regions) a crack islikely to initiate anywhere between the snag and the root section of the ﬁber, but notprimarily near the same location and in fatiguing the snag must always be at thesame spot on the same hairs. Furthermore, once initiated, the crack is propagatedand terminated by thousands of fatiguing actions at exactly the same spot. There-fore, fatiguing would not be expected to show such a close relationship between thelocation on the ﬁber where catastrophic failure occurs and the hair to comb interfacein tangles as has been found.This rationale holds especially for long segment breaks. Some short segment
breaks likely involve a fatiguing action, but even most short segment breaks willultimately require a ﬁnal high localized stress to produce catastrophic failure.Furthermore, short segment breaks are not easily detected by consumers (most ofwhich are less than 1 cm) and often fall unnoticed into the sink. But, long segmentbreaks (along with pulled out hairs) end up in the comb or brush and those are thehairs that bother consumers.Tress combing experiments when snags produce high combing forces, show thatbroken hairs can be collected in tens of comb strokes [ 27,28] rather than inthousands of comb strokes necessary for fatigue breakage. These combing forcefacts have been demonstrated in various ways and they clearly demonstrate thathigh localized stresses created by tangles are the primary cause of hair breakage byimpact more so than by fatiguing actions.10.3.11 Summary of Hair Breakage as a Complex MultifactorialPhenomenon
Phenomenon– Tangle formation is involved with hair ﬁbers looped over other hairs and severebending deformations as suggested by Brown and Swift [ 29].– Hairs are broken by impact [ 19] generated by pulling a brush or a comb througha tangle producing high localized forces where one or more hairs are looped overanother hair or hairs [ 26,29].– The complexity of snags increases with hair ﬁber curvature [ 8,27] producingvery high combing forces in both the mid-length and end peak regions.– The amount of water in the ﬁbers affects combing forces and hair breakage [ 27].Straight to wavy hair when combed dry produces higher end peak forces thanmid-length forces, but when wet produces higher mid-length combing forces[12] corresponding to where hairs break and to the amount of breakage.– The work of combing of highly coiled hair is lower wet than dry, but the reverse
holds for wavy to straight hair [ 8,27] producing more breakage for coiled hair658 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
when it is dry and more breakage for straight to wavy hair when it is wet,corresponding to combing forces.– Chemical damage by perms, bleaches, permanent dyes [ 32], straighteners [ 33]and sunlight exposure [ 34] weaken hair and increase inter-ﬁber friction leadingto more tangle formation and more breakage. Once again breakage correspondsto combing forces.– Conditioners reduce combing and brushing forces and have been shown toproduce less hair breakage [ 27] consistent with combing forces.– Wear by abrasion for straight to wavy hair occurs from combing over the entireﬁber, but more near the ﬁber tips because of a longer residence time, but evenmore so by high end peak forces when dry [ 12] as evidenced by an increase inthe number of short segment breaks [ 12,27].– Combs or brushes with more space between the teeth or bristles lead to fewer
and less complex tangles and therefore to lower combing forces, to less abrasionand fewer broken hairs. Most brushes provide more long segment breaks andfewer short segment breaks than combs [ 28].The literature on hair breakage clearly shows that the primary factors involved inhair breakage are the occurrence of tangles created by combing or brushing whereat least one or more hair ﬁbers are severely bent around at least one other hair [ 12,26,29]. Furthermore, hair breakage correlates with combing forces. In addition,combing force curves vs. breakage shows that where the break occurs along theﬁber corresponds to the higher combing forces in combing force curves. Therefore,highly localized stresses are created by hair on hair impact when one pulls a combor a brush through a tangle [ 29]. As a result, one or more hairs break, either with or
without ﬂaws, under this condition. Other variables (described above) are clearlyinvolved to determine the actual number of broken hairs and the type of fractures.These variables are described in detail above and include hair type (primarilycurvature) [ 2,8,27], hair condition (treatments and wear) and wet vs. dry combingor brushing of the hair and the speciﬁc grooming device as explained in thediscussion above. Brushing and combing and fatiguing certainly play a role inweakening hair especially for short segment breaks but it is unlikely to lead to ahigh percentage of fatigue breaks as claimed by Evans and Park [ 37] unless onebroadens the fatigue deﬁnition to include anywhere from two cycles to more thanmillions, but low cycle fatiguing starts at 50,000 cycles and goes down.10.4 Split Ends, Types, Their Occurrence and Formation
This author carried out a project to identify the different types of split hairs thatform on live heads under “normal” usage conditions by consumers. An arrangementwas made with a local hair dresser to collect hair clippings from his customers thathe judged would likely have split hairs. A questionnaire was completed by the hairdresser in collaboration with the client to provide an idea of the type of hair and the10.4 Split Ends, Types, Their Occurrence and Formation 659
different types of treatments and conditions that the hair had been exposed to. Haircuttings were collected from eight different consumers and the hairs examinedinitially under a magnifying lens with a light to separate out the split hairs. Thesplits were then photographed and classiﬁed according to the types summarizedin Table 10.2.Figures 10.8,10.9,10.10 ,10.11 ,10.12 ,10.13 ,10.14 ,10.15 ,10.16 ,10.17 ,10.18 ,10.19 ,10.20 and 10.21 depict the different types of split hairs described inTable 10.2. Figure 10.8 is a magniﬁed photograph of two split ends; the one nearestthe lower left corner is a simple small split end while the other is a simple large splitend. The legs of the split in each case are nearly equal in length and width; thereforethese are called simple split ends. The distinction between the large and the small
simple split end is when the length of the legs of the split is about 10 times the widthof the hair ﬁber or longer it is called a large split end. Large split ends can be ofthree different types: One type is when the two legs of the split are essentially equalin width (Figs. 10.8 and also see 10.9 for an extreme case of a large simple splitend). Another type is when the two legs are unequal in width (see Fig. 10.10 ).A third type is when the two legs are unequal in length and the short leg does notappear to be broken off or when the two legs of the split are unequal and the shortleg is broken off (this split is sometimes not distinguishable from a split end off of astep fracture (Fig. 10.11 )).A split end off of a step fracture is illustrated in Fig. 10.11 . Kamath andWeigmann [ 23] described this type of split end in their paper on fractography ofhuman hair. The split end of Fig. 10.12 also appears to be a split end off of a step
fracture, although it may have been a simple large split end in which a part of one ofthe legs broke off.

appears to be ready to break off. This split resembles the break found in the geneticabnormality Trichorrhexis nodosa described in Chap. 1. It is remarkable that suchhairs can still exist on human heads, but all these split ends came from live heads ofconsumers who used normal consumer or salon hair products on their hair.Figure 10.13 depicts a complex split end. I deﬁne a complex split end as one thathas either two or more splits at different parts of the ﬁber or three or more legs off ofa single split end.

periodically for 2 years. This damaged hair ﬁber remained on her head and the legsof the splits remained intact without breaking off.Figure 10.15 is another complex split hair that was found on the head of aCaucasian female with shoulder length hair who had used permanent dye periodi-cally on her hair. This woman was also a frequent sun bather and used a straighten-ing iron on her hair regularly. These three treatments involve free radical reactions.This ﬁber is another example that I would have expected to have broken off and notbe found on the head of a person. Figure 10.16 is another complex split hair inwhich the three legs of this split originate from or near the split origin.Figure 10.17 is an example of a split hair that is not at the distal end of the hair
ﬁber. In this case the split occurred about 4 cm from the tip end of the ﬁber. I haveseen cases of this type of split hair in which the distal end of the split is at least 6 cmfrom the distal end of a hair ﬁber. In this particular case the origin of the splitFig. 10.16 A compound split end with three legs near the origin of the splitFig. 10.17 A split hair not asplit end. This split was foundabout 4 cm from the distal endof the ﬁber664 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
appears to be close to a twist. This hair was taken from the head of a Caucasianfemale who treated her hair periodically with oxidation dye. About 1 year prior tocutting, she had a cosmetologist apply a peroxide-persulfate bleach to her hair. Shealso spent considerable time sun bathing in the Florida sun and regularly used a hotiron straightener and a blow drier on her hair. The oxidation dye, bleach, sunbathingand hot iron all involve free radical reactions.Figure 10.18 is a split hair (found from the hair of the same woman) in which thefracture site is not at the end. In this case, the ﬁber has fractured but remainsconnected by ﬁbrils that resemble the broom-like fractures at the nodes ofFig. 10.18 A split hair not a split end where the ﬁber is held together by ﬁbrils a few centimetersfrom the distal endFig. 10.19 Another split hair not at the end.

But in this case the effect is caused by cosmetictreatments and grooming actions, not by a genetic abnormality.Figure 10.19 is another case of a partially broken hair ﬁber in which the fracturesite is far from the distal end. This woman periodically used permanent dye on herhair and she regularly used a straightening iron on it but indicated she did notsunbathe (two free radical treatments).The hair ﬁber depicted in Fig. 10.20 contains a slit far from the distal end. Thisﬁgure shows the slit at two different magniﬁcations. This split goes completelythrough the ﬁber but does not continue to the distal end.

she sunbathed frequently and regularly used a straightening iron on her hair; onceagain three free radical treatments.Figure 10.21 is an example of a split hair at a knot. Several knots were found inthe hair of this Caucasian woman who had curly hair (curl type III by the STAMprocedure). This woman regularly used a straightening iron on her hair and period-ically used permanent hair dye and a peroxide-persulfate bleach system had beenapplied to her hair by a hair dresser. She also occasionally sunbathed. In each casewhere I examined knots under the light microscope I could see varying amounts ofﬁbrillation at or near the site of the knot. Figure 10.21 depicts the most extensiveﬁbrillation that I observed at a knot.10.4.1 Hair Treated with Free Radical Cosmetics and Sunlightare Susceptible to SplittingThe data of Table 10.2 shows that the highest incidence of splits (splits per gram of
hair) and the most severe splits occurred on the hair that had received both ableaching treatment (oxidation dyed or bleached) and frequent sunlight exposure.The one exception is the hair that was treated with a peroxide-persulfate frostingtreatment (another free radical system) multiple times over a 2 year period. All hairsamples were shoulder length or longer. So, a common factor in the hair with themost severe and most splits involved extensive free radical attack on the hair.Robbins [ 38] described the cortex-cortex cell membrane complex as the area ofthe ﬁber that is most sensitive to free radical attack, because of its multiplicity ofdouble bonds (allylic groups) and tertiary hydrogen atoms. This conclusion isconsistent with the conclusion of Kamath and Weigmann [ 23] in their paper onfracturing of human hair and with the paper by Swift [ 39] on split end formation.Kamath and Weigmann [ 23] observed that the cortex-cortex cell membrane com-
plex serves as an area for the axial propagation of cracks which can ultimately leadto split hairs.Zimmerman and Hocker [ 40] in their studies on radiation of wool ﬁbers showedthat wool ﬁbers that were not irradiated, when fractured, provided mainly smooth orcut fractures. Wool ﬁbers that received short and intermediate term exposures tosimulated sunlight when fractured provided mainly step and split fractures. How-ever, after long times of irradiation (approaching unrealistic exposures for hair onheads) when fractured the ﬁbers provided amorphous fractures. Therefore, thecortex-cortex cell membrane complex after it has been damaged by exposure tofree radical reactions is prone to crack formation and the splitting of hairs.The types of free radical reactions that commonly occur on live heads are in sun
exposure, bleaching with either peroxide-persulfate or peroxide where copper oriron is present (including permanent dyeing) and/or hair that has undergone a largenumber of exposures to heat treatments such as hot curling or straightening irons.These effects have been conﬁrmed by the types of hair most prone to split endformation on live heads described in Table 10.2.10.4 Split Ends, Types, Their Occurrence and Formation 667
10.4.2 Causes of Split Hairs and Split EndsAmong the more important scientiﬁc papers with regard to splitting of hairs are thehair fracturing studies by Kamath and Weigmann [ 23,24], the paper describing amechanism for split end formation by Swift [ 39], the hair breakage study by Brownand Swift [ 29], the study of irradiation of wool ﬁber by Zimmerman and Hocker[40] and the hair breakage studies by Robbins [ 19,26] and by Robbins and Kamath[27,28].The literature provides the following conclusions with regard to split endformation:1. Split hairs form more readily in the dry state than the wet state, particularly from30% to 65% RH [ 23]. In addition, this author has shown in unpublished workthat split ends are formed more readily from dry combing than from wetcombing.2. Splits form more readily on oxidized hair (see Table 10.3) and on damagedhair in general [ 29,39,40]; also see Table 10.3. The use of conditioners decrease
split end formation, see Table 10.3. The evaluation of split hairs taken fromheads shows that ﬁbers that have been exposed to photochemical and chemicalbleaching and in some cases also treated with straightening irons (free radicaltype exposures) are susceptible to split end formation.3. Paragraph 2 supports this conclusion that the cortex-cortex cell membranecomplex serves as a route for the propagation of axial splits in the ﬁber andfor the formation of split ends [ 23,38].4. Splits form more readily on abraded [ 19,23] and or weathered hair [ 29,39], thatis, hairs in which large sections of cuticle have been removed [ 23].5. There is a stronger association between short segment breaks and split ends thanlong segment breaks and split ends (see Table 10.4).Table 10.3 Effect of chemical bleaching and conditioning on split end formation and on long andshort segment breaks after combing at 50% RHHair type and treatment Split endsaShort breaksaLong breaksa

6. Split hairs form more from bending [ 29,39] or impact loading [ 19] than fromextension actions [ 29,39].7. Cross-cutting hair tresses or a switch so that all of the ﬁbers are essentially of thesame length increases the number and severity of splits, see Table 10.4.The data of Table 10.4 shows that cross cutting the hair so that the ends of thehair are nearly equal in length vs. taper cutting the hair (ends are of differentlengths) increases the number of split ends nearly threefold. As expected, the endpeak force in quantitative combing also increases by cross cutting the hair. In thiscase the increase was by a factor of about 4. In another study the end peak force wasfound to correlate with short segment breaks and the data of Table 10.4 shows adirectional effect between split ends and short segment breaks. The split end data ofTable 10.3 was obtained on hair tresses that had been used in a breakage study
where short and long segment breaks were also counted. These data were analyzedby analysis of variance providing a signiﬁcant relationship between short segmentbreaks and the number of split ends; however, the relationship between longsegment breaks and split ends was not signiﬁcant. This analysis suggests a relation-ship or a connection between short segment breakage and split end formation. Inaddition, previous data on similar types of hair and similar tresses shows that theend peak force increases by a factor of about 5 (Table 10.4) by cross-cutting hair vs.taper cutting.These results (Table 10.4) suggest that the end wrapping mechanism describedby Robbins and Kamath [ 27] for formation of short segment breaks is likelyinvolved in the formation of split ends. Before combing, hairs exist in complexinterwoven patterns and the curlier and longer the hairs the more complex the
interweaving. As the comb descends through the hair, sections of hair above thecomb are made parallel. Those hair ﬁbers beneath the comb are either made parallelor entangled. Entanglements occur by hairs looping around other hairs, or hairslooping around comb teeth and other hairs between the comb and the distal tips ofthe ﬁbers.As the comb continues to advance through the looped/entangled hairs longsegment breaks occur. As the comb approaches the tips (when the hair is dry)wrapped ends result. End wrapping of hai rs around comb teeth and other hairsoccurs by inertia and possibly static c harge. End wrapping produces a high endpeak force resulting in high abrasion an d severe bending deformations along withimpacting and fatiguing all resulting in short segment breaks ( <2.5 cm). Shortsegment breaks are more numerous if the hair is cross cut compared with a taperedcut or if the hair is damaged wherein inter-ﬁber and hair on comb friction ishigher.
Split ends form from a crack in the cortex-cortex cell membrane complex as aresult of severe bending deformations [ 39] and hair on hair impacting [ 19,28]i nwrapped ends. The crack propagates to the end of the hair particularly on highlyabraded hair wherein some cuticle has been worn away. Two schemes [ 23,39]described in the literature for split end formation are described below.10.4 Split Ends, Types, Their Occurrence and Formation 669
10.4.3 Mechanisms for Formation of SplitsThe formation of split hairs has been either directly or indirectly studied by severaldifferent scientists. Since so many different types of split hairs have been identiﬁed(Figs. 10.8,10.9,10.10 ,10.11 ,10.12 ,10.13 ,10.14 ,10.15 ,10.16 ,10.17 ,10.18 ,10.19 ,10.20 ,10.21 ), more than one mechanism is likely to be involved to accountfor the different types of splits.The literature suggests that split hairs can form from bending [ 39] and fromstretching actions [ 23] although Swift suggests that bending actions are moreimportant than stretching on heads. From an examination of the hair literatureand the seven factors above that promote or lead to increased split formation,I conclude that split hairs form more readily from abrasion in combination withimpact loading involving bending and or torsional deformations.Swift [ 39] provided the following mechanism for the formation of split hairs. He
explained that snags form as the comb approaches the distal ends of the hair. Whenthis occurs hairs become increasingly bent over each other and comb teeth (endwrapping occurs). Swift explained that since most hairs are elliptical they will bendabout the plane of the major elliptic diameter. Upon bending, shear stresses will beparabolic and distributed across the minor axial diameter with a maximum at theplane containing the major axial diameter. Shear fracture then occurs which tends topropagate toward the tip end by the continued bending and straightening of the hair.This author believes that Swifts mechanism does occur with highly elliptical hairsthat are damaged, but other mechanisms are operable under other conditions.Kamath and Weigmann [ 23] also offered a mechanism for split end formation intheir paper on hair fracturing. This mechanism does not favor or preclude any ﬁbershape from the formation of split ends. Kamath calls this mechanism “shock-wave”
splitting. I discussed this mechanism with Kamath while we were working togetheron hair breakage. According to the mechanism of Kamath, “shock-wave” splittingoccurs at low humidity when the ﬁber is impacted and deformed in a snag and whenthe cuticle is damaged and weakened.The following mechanism is what I have taken from these discussions and I havemerged Swift’s and Kamath’s mechanisms in the following manner. When thecomb approaches the distal ends of the hair, end wrapping occurs and relativelyhigh forces are applied to move the hair through the ends. This likely involves
bending actions and as Swift proposed since most hair ﬁbers are elliptical bendingwill occur about the plane of the major axial diameter. At that instant primarilythrough impact loading and severe bending deformations a crack is formed in thecortex. Residual elastic energy then dissipates like a shock wave in a radial plane atthe fracture faces. The shock wave is then propagated axially through the damagedcortex-cortex cell membrane complex forming the split hair or split end. Further-more, splitting is most prone to occur at low RH and when the ﬁber is damaged(both in the cuticle and in the cortex-cortex cell membrane complex). When thecuticle is damaged and weakened that is highly abraded with badly worn tip ends sothat there are too few cuticle layers to strongly hold the ends together and the cortex670 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
cell membrane complex has been highly oxidized by free radical chemistry the“shock wave” propagates rapidly to the end of the ﬁber. Thus, this phenomenon isassociated with short segment hair breakage explaining the correlation of shortsegment breaks with split ends.10.5 Flyaway Hair10.5.1 Static Charge and FlyawayWhen a comb is brought into contact with hair at low RH, charges of opposite signbut equal magnitude are generated on both the comb and the hair surface. Thecharges are generated because of the difference in the afﬁnity of each of thesematerials for electrons (electrochemical potential). The repulsive forces of staticelectricity on the hair cause the ﬁbers to separate producing Flyaway Hair [ 1]. Static
electricity consists of electrons or ions that are not moving. It results from rubbingand pressure during combing and brushing between two poorly conductingsurfaces. An electric charge from friction is called triboelectricity; that frompressure is called piezoelectricity.After combing or after separation of the comb from the hair, the dissipation ofthe static charge is governed by the conductivity (reciprocal of resistivity) of theﬁbers or their electrical resistance. In general, materials with a high electricalresistance such as human hair, wool, silk, or nylon are more prone to static buildupthan are lower-resistance materials like cotton and rayon [ 41]. Therefore, thephenomenon of static ﬂyaway is concerned with three conditions:– Static charge generation on the ﬁbers,– Conductivity or the removal of static charge from the hair, and– Hair type.The primary factors involved in static charge generation are (1) the difference in
electrochemical potentials of the two surfaces, and (2) the rubbing forces involved.For example, the use of lubricants can reduce rubbing forces and in that mannerprovide less charge generation [ 6]. Jachowicz et al. [ 14] determined that theconductivity of the hair surface is also important to static ﬂyaway. These scientistsdemonstrated that long-chain quaternary ammonium salts increase the conductivityof the hair surface in addition to decreasing hair ﬁber friction. For these tworeasons, long-chain quaternary ammonium compounds are excellent antistaticagents.Hair type is also relevant to the condition of ﬂyaway hair. For example, hair ﬁbercurvature is critical to ﬂyaway. Robbins [ 6,42] proposed that by the C2hypothesis,
2hypothesis,at high curvature (for example, Curl types IV–VIII), ﬂyaway hair would be minimalor nonexistent. This lack of ﬂyaway is because the entanglements created by highcurvature hair will dominate over the ability of the ﬁbers to separate from static10.5 Flyaway Hair 671
charge. He demonstrated that tresses of Caucasian hair steam set to Curl type V hadno ﬂyaway in spite of a high static charge build-up. On the other hand, hair tressesof Curl type II with the same static charge generated extreme ﬂyaway. Furthermore,when the two hair tresses were brought together, the ﬂyaway ﬁbers of Curl type IIwere repelled by the entangled hairs of the Curl type V tress. This effect proves thatthe higher curvature hair did have static charge build-up capable of producingﬂyaway, but not on highly coiled hair. This experiment also supports the hypothesis[6,42] that at high degrees of curvature, curvature dominates the hair assemblyproperty of ﬂyaway hair as it does for so many consumer hair assembly properties.10.5.2 Methods Relevant to Static FlyawayMills et al. [ 43] described two techniques for estimating static charge on humanhair. The “ballooning method” actually estimates static ﬂyaway. This method
consists of acclimating tresses at a desired low humidity in a chamber (generallyfor 24 h) and then combing the hair in a controlled manner. The relative amount ofstatic charge is then estimated by the amount of ballooning or separation of theﬁbers of the tress (see Fig. 10.22 ). The second method of Mills et al. [ 43] consists ofﬁrst acclimating tresses, then combing them in a controlled manner with a specialcomb containing a bare copper wire in its back. The copper wire leads through aninsulated holder to an oscillograph. The charge on the comb is measured, andtheoretically it is equal and opposite to that on the hair.Barber and Posner [ 44], Lunn and Evans [ 13], and Jachowicz et al. [ 14] haveall described similar yet more sophisticated approaches. Lunn and Evans [ 13]described methods for measuring charge generation on hair tresses, charge mobilityon the hair, and charge distribution along the hair ﬁbers. These methods involve
Fig. 10.22 Static ballooning of hairs in a tress due to static charge build-up672 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
combing hair tresses to induce the charge. Jachowicz et al. [ 14] developed a usefulmethod to measure both charge generation and charge decay by rubbing hair ﬁbersagainst different elements under controlled conditions. Jachowicz et al. alsomeasured charge density along the length of tresses and showed that the electricalﬁeld that concentrates near the ﬁber tips causes ﬂyaway hair.The measurement of static charge on textile ﬁbers, fabrics, and yarns has alsoreceived a considerable amount of scientiﬁc attention and is relevant to this samesubject on human hair. The book by Meredith and Hearle [ 45] provides a goodintroduction into this subject. Electrical resistance (reciprocal of conductance) ofﬁbers is also fundamental to their static electriﬁcation and is described by Hersh[46] for human hair and other ﬁbers and by Meredith and Hearle [ 45] for textileﬁbers.10.5.3 Triboelectric SeriesAttempts have been made [ 47,48] to classify materials according to “triboelectric
series” which lists materials in an order so that the higher one on the list will bepositively charged and the lower one negatively charged when any two of thematerials are rubbed together. In theory, triboelectric classiﬁcations should beuseful, because the relative afﬁnity for electrons of each of the materials in contact(electrochemical potential) is very important to the charge developed [ 13]. How-ever, such series are generally not very consistent.10.5.4 Moisture Content and ResistanceThe moisture content of human hair provides a large inﬂuence on static charge.Increasing moisture in hair decreases its electrical resistance [ 46]. Therefore,increasing moisture increases the conductivity of the ﬁber surface so that it is lessprone to develop a static charge because the electrons distribute more evenly overthe entire hair surface.The electrical resistances of wool and human hair have been shown to be very
similar at 85% RH (see Table 10.5), and their resistances are similar from 52% to85% RH [ 49]. Since the moisture binding-RH relationships of wool and human hairfrom 0% to 100% RH are virtually identical (see Table 9.33), their resistance-RHrelationships from 0% to 100% RH must also be very similar. Morton and HearleTable 10.5 Electricalresistance of wool and humanhair at 85% RH [ 46]Wool 4.2–7.4 /C21012ΩHuman hair 10.0–17.0 /C21012Ω10.5 Flyaway Hair 673
[41] described the resistance of wool ﬁber to vary by a factor of approximately 105from 10% to 90% RH and by a much larger factor from 0% to 100% RH.Conﬁrming this relationship of resistance-RH and static charge for human hair isthe effect of RH on static charge shown by Mills et al. [ 43] (see Table 10.6). Thesedata show a progressive decrease in the static charge developed on the hair withincreasing RH, for each of two different types of treatment. For both treatments, theprincipal effect of RH is to increase the water content of the hair. Increasing thewater in the hair surface decreases its electrical resistance, making the ﬁber a betterconducting system and therefore less capable of retaining a static charge.10.5.5 Temperature and Static ChargeThe resistance of keratin ﬁbers generally decreases as temperature increases. Anincrease of 10/C14C will produce approximately a ﬁvefold decrease in resistance [ 43].
Therefore, the perceived effect of temperature on conductivity does not appear to bethe cause of greater ﬂyaway from hot combing as compared to room temperaturecombing.10.5.6 Impurities on the Fiber Surface can Inﬂuence StaticChargeFor hygroscopic ﬁbers like wool ﬁber and human hair, the resistance can beinﬂuenced by electrolyte content. For example, the addition of potassium chloridelowers the resistance of wool, whereas washing in distilled water can increasewool’s resistance [ 43] by removal of electrolyte from the hair surface layers.10.5.7 The Amount of Static Generated is VirtuallyIndependent of Rubbing VelocityHersh’s [ 46,48] studies with textile ﬁbers suggest that the amount of static chargegeneration is virtually independent of rubbing speed, when rubbing one high-Table 10.6 Effect of RH on the static charge developed on human hair for a shampoo and a cre `merinse conditionera[43]% Relative humidityTreatment 27% RH 51% RH 76.5% RH

resistance ﬁber against another high-resistance ﬁber. However, Cunningham andMontgomery [ 50] have shown an increase in static charge with increasing rubbingvelocity when rubbing high-resistance ﬁbers against metal ﬁbers. Rubbing velocitiesin both these studies were approximately 1–30 cm/s.10.5.8 Decreasing Rubbing or Combing Forces DecreasesStatic ChargeAfter tresses are shampooed and combed, the amount of static ballooning alsodepends on the amount of combing. As already indicated, Lunn and Evans [ 13]concluded that the primary way that long-chain quaternary ammonium salts reducestatic buildup is by decreasing inter-ﬁber friction which in turn reduces the workof combing. Therefore, one way to reduce static buildup is to reduce the work ofcombing, which is to make the hair comb easier [ 44].10.5.9 The Sign of the Charge is Related to the Directionof RubbingThe sign of the static charge that develops on both human hair and wool when
rubbed against similar ﬁbers has been shown to be related to the direction ofrubbing [ 14,46,51]. If the ﬁbers are oriented in the same direction and one ﬁberis removed from the bundle by pulling it out by its root end, a positive chargedevelops on this ﬁber. If a ﬁber is removed from the bundle by pulling it by its tipend, a negative charge develops on the ﬁber. If the ﬁber that is removed is orientedopposite to the other ﬁbers of the bundle, or if it contains no scales, no chargedevelops on it. Although this effect is not fully understood, it has been attributed tothe heterogeneity of the scales. The points of the scale edges have been suggested tohave a different triboelectric nature from the main scale surfaces. Therefore,rubbing a ﬁber root to tip rubs primarily against scale surfaces, whereas rubbingtip to root rubs mainly against scale edges [ 46].An equally interesting effect on the sign of the static charge on hair has also been
found to relate to the nature of surface deposits or treatments [ 14,41]. Washing hairtresses with an anionic shampoo and drying at low relative humidity and thencombing produces a large amount of static ballooning. Flyaway was considerablyless for tresses treated with a cationic creme rinse followed by water rinsing anddrying. However, if tresses were treated with a cationic creme rinse and not rinsedor only lightly rinsed with water, a relatively large amount of ballooning wasapparent. Furthermore, the charged ﬁbers from this treatment were attracted to(not repelled from) charged ﬁbers from the anionic shampoo treatment, indicating10.5 Flyaway Hair 675
opposite signs of static electricity. This different sign for the charge was conﬁrmedby oscillographic measurements. Jachowicz et al. [ 14] described related effects.For discussion and theoretical explanations and controversies on the staticelectriﬁcation of ﬁbers, see the book by Morton and Hearle [ 41], the thesis byHersh [ 46], and the paper by Jachowicz et al. [ 14].10.5.10 Effect of Ingredients on the Static ChargeTable 10.6 describes the effects of shampoos (high cleaning) compared with cremerinses on the development of static charge on hair. The amount of charge developedby combing or brushing hair tresses (straight to wavy hair) is related to the amountof ﬂyaway. The amount of ﬂyaway generated is related to both the chargeability(charge generation and conductivity combined) of the hair ﬁbers and to the workof combing. The lower static values (see Table 10.6) for both creme rinse and
shampoo treatments as a function of RH are due primarily to a decrease in theelectrical resistance of the hair, and the lower work of combing, as well as theincreased moisture content (see Table 9.32). When the resistance drops below acertain value near 108Ω-g/cm2, the charge can apparently spread more readily overthe entire hair to adjacent surfaces and dissipate into the air. In this manner, thecharge density required to cause noticeable ﬂyaway is not exceeded.Jachowicz et al. [ 14] found that the adsorption of long chain quaternary ammo-nium compounds, cationic polymers, and some speciﬁc polymer-detergentcomplexes decreased the electrochemical potential and increased the conductivityof hair. Of course, long-chain quaternary ammonium compounds also decrease therubbing forces by a lubricating action. This lubrication decreased the chargegenerated, and Lunn and Evans [ 13] suggested that lubrication is the major reason
for the antistatic effect of creme rinses. Jachowicz et al. [ 14] suggested that theincrease in surface conductivity by quats in creme rinses is also important to theeffectiveness of these ingredients as antistats. Therefore, the lower static charge forcreme rinse vs. shampoo treatments (Table 10.6) is a result of lower frictional dragduring combing as well as an increase in the conductivity of the hair. The change inresistance (of keratin ﬁbers) from 1012to 108Ω-g/cm2that occurs between 22% and77% RH (Table 10.7) approximates the required decrease in resistance for a cremerinse effect at 27–76% RH (Table 10.8), assuming that a large part of the antistaticeffect by creme rinses is due to an increase in conductivity.Table 10.7 Effect of relativehumidity on electricalresistance of hair% RH Approximate R sfor woola[46]27 101277 108aRs¼resistance in ohms between the ends of a specimen 1 cm

Jachowicz et al. [ 14] modiﬁed hair ﬁbers by reduction, bleaching, and oxidationdyes and found only a small difference in triboelectric charge vs. chemicallyunaltered hair and no increase in surface conductivity by these treatments.10.6 Hair Shine or LusterConsumer research suggests that hair shine is a more meaningful cosmetic term toconsumers than luster. The word luster is used more frequently in scientiﬁc workson textile materials. In most of our work on this important cosmetic property, theobjective was to develop methods to correlate with the consumers’ subjectiveassessment of hair shine. The words shine and luster are used interchangeably inthis discussion.When hair is illuminated, the incident light may be reﬂected at the surfaceor refracted (bent) (see Fig. 10.23 ). It may enter the ﬁber and be absorbed (by
pigment), or it may reemerge, usually after hitting the rear wall of the ﬁber, where itis partly reﬂected and refracted again. The phenomenon of light scattering is amajor subject of this section, and we shall see how reﬂection of light may eitherenhance or reduce hair shine, how refraction of light can reduce hair shine, and howabsorption of light can enhance it.10.6.1 The Scale Angle and the Specular to Diffuse ReﬂectanceRatioLight striking hair in a root-to-tip direction at an incident angle of 30/C14, provides aspecular reﬂection of 24/C14(large peak of Fig. 10.24 ), rather than 30/C14. The specularreﬂectance may be estimated from light-scattering curves (Fig. 10.24 ), primarilyfrom the specular peak height. If the axis of the hair is 30/C14relative to the incidentlight, then the scale angle must be 3/C14(30–2 /C2scale angle ¼24/C14). The second peak(lower peak) of Fig. 10.24 occurs at approximately 40/C14, and represents light that has
entered the ﬁber and is reﬂected from the back wall of the hair. This second peak ismuch larger for blond hair (dashed line) than for dark brown hair (solid line)because of the greater absorption of light in the cortex by the additional pigmentgranules of the darker hair.When incident light strikes a surface, it may be reﬂected specularly (S), when theangle of reﬂectance equals the incident angle (which increases shine), or it may beTable 10.8 Effect of cremerinse and RH on static chargein hair [ 43]27% RH 76% RHShampoo 11.5–14.3 2.2–3.3Rinses 2.0–3.8 0.4–0.5aData are relative pip heights from oscillographic recordings ofcharge on the comb10.6 Hair Shine or Luster 677

Unless one examines a perfect mirror, a combi-nation of both specular and diffuse reﬂection takes place.Diffuse scattering may be estimated from light-scattering curves by drawing aline between the light intensities (voltages of Fig. 10.24 ) at 0–75/C14and measuringthe area under the line. A light scattering curve with an incident light of 30/C14strikingthe ﬁber in a tip to root direction, shows the back wall reﬂection near 15/C14and thespecular reﬂection at 36/C14, once again suggesting a 3/C14scale angle.Some ratio of specular to diffuse reﬂectance is generally accepted as a measureof luster for ﬁbers and yarns [ 52–54]. Ward and Benerito [ 52] determined that theratio of specular to diffuse reﬂectance for cotton ﬁbers correlates with visual lusterassessments. Fourt [ 53] suggested a contrast ratio for evaluating luster of wool
fabric, using a ratio of specular reﬂectance at a 45/C14angle of incidence to diffusereﬂectance at 0/C14. Stamm et al. [ 55] suggested the function:Hair shine ¼S/C0DðÞ =Swhere S ¼specular reﬂectance and D ¼diffuse reﬂectance.Fig. 10.23 Some parameters important to hair luster678 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
10.6.2 Hair Shine MethodsHair shine may be evaluated subjectively on tresses or on heads of hair (preferablyon half heads), or it may be evaluated instrumentally. The subjective evaluation ofhair shine on tresses can be very consistent and reliable, provided care is taken toconsistently align the ﬁbers of the tresses, to control lighting, to use multipleobservers to evaluate tresses, and to use replication. Figure 10.25 is a photographof a board constructed to help align the ﬁbers of a tress consistently and to orient thetresses with respect to the lighting. This board also helps to keep the tresses alignedduring the evaluation period. Six tresses seem optimal for any single test. There-fore, only two to three treatments can be evaluated at a time. The data should beanalyzed by a nonparametric procedure such as the Friedman or Kruskal Wallistest [ 56].Similar care should be taken for subjective analysis of shine on live heads. The
primary variables to control for evaluating shine on live heads are lighting and hairalignment [ 57]. Alignment can be controlled to a limited degree by parting the hairin the center of the head and blow-drying the hair while combing it straight afterFig. 10.24 Light-scattering curves from dark brown hair ( solid line ) and blonde hair ( dashed line )[58] (Reprinted with permission of the Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists)10.6 Hair Shine or Luster 679
treatment. A useful system is to treat hair on heads and to take 30–40 ﬁbers per sideafter treatment and to evaluate the ﬁbers instrumentally for shine by light scattering.Several different instrumental methods and approaches have been used toevaluate the shine of human hair [ 45,54–62] (Schebece and Scott, private commu-nication). The method of Thompson and Mills [ 54] measures reﬂectance from anassembly of hair ﬁbers; the methods of Stamm et al. [ 55] and Reich and Robbins[58] measure light scattered from either single hairs or from a parallel array of tauthair ﬁbers. The method of Schebece and Scott (private communication) measureslight reﬂected from single hair ﬁbers alone. The method of McMullen andJachowicz [ 60] takes digital images of tresses and analyzes the data with specialsoftware.The method of Thompson and Mills [ 54] illuminates a small tress of hair after
the ﬁbers have been carefully aligned over a cylinder 4 in. in diameter. A photocellis placed at an angle of 160/C14to the incident beam, and at varying distances from thehair sample. The hair is rotated to give a maximum reading. The light source is at aﬁxed distance (10 in.) from the hair sample. From these parameters, both thespecular (S) and diffuse (D) reﬂectance can be calculated using the followingexpression, after taking readings at more than one sample to photocell distance(X). In this case, Cos C is the cosine of 80/C14.Intensity of light reflected ¼SD cos CX2The limitations of ﬁber alignment—the inability to vary incident angle or to scanall reﬂected light from the surface—with the Thompson and Mills method aresolved by the goniophotometric methods of Stamm et al. [ 55], Schebece andScott (private communication), and Reich and Robbins [ 58]. From a strip chartrecording of intensity of reﬂected light vs. angle of observation (see Fig. 10.24 ), the
specular reﬂectance and diffuse reﬂectance are obtained. Currently the best func-tion for hair shine is this one by Reich and Robbins [ 58]:Fig. 10.25 Tress holder developed for panelists assessment of hair shine680 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
L¼S=DWð1=2Þwhere S is the specular reﬂection, D is the diffuse reﬂection and W(1/2) is the widthof the specular peak at half-height.Most quantitative methods to measure hair luster have relied on goniopho-tometric measurements of either single hairs or an array of parallel hairs usingsome function of the ratio of specular to diffuse reﬂection [ 55,58]. Although tresseshave been employed for measurement of luster [ 54] no one had successfullyadapted this method to measure luster on curly African type hair tresses. However,McMullen and Jachowicz [ 60] described a novel luster method that shows promise
for measuring luster on curly African hair as well as on curly Caucasian and Asianhair. In this method, the authors recorded digital images of hair tresses with a digitalcamera coupled to a macro lens. They then analyzed the photographs using specialsoftware (Image Tool 2.0 from the University of Texas Health Science School) thattook into account the number of reﬂection sites and their shapes. This method wascapable of showing that sebum dulls African hair and it appears to show promise asa means for measuring luster on many types of hair even curly hair. Even though Ihave a concern about potentially large variances in measuring luster in curly hair orwhole heads of hair (because of variable hair alignment), this approach appears tooffer promise for a solution to this difﬁcult problem.10.6.3 Fiber Alignment, Orientation, and Hair Shine
When hair ﬁbers of an assembly are aligned parallel, maximum specular (mirror)reﬂectance can be obtained with minimum scattering [ 54]. The problem of consis-tently aligning the ﬁbers of a tress or hair on the head the same repeatedly orsufﬁciently parallel perhaps produces the largest variance in shine evaluations. As aresult, alignment interferes with the ability to see small changes in hair shine, thus,the obvious advantage of the instrumental methods that evaluate either single hairsor a parallel array of hairs [ 55–59].Keis et al. [ 59] described the effects of hair ﬁber curvature on hair luster and on
hair of different populations. They explained that high curvature hair in an assem-bly generally displays low luster because it interferes with a uniform parallelalignment of ﬁbers and thereby increases the amount of scattered light. This lightscattering effect suggests that luster will generally decrease with increasing ﬁbercurvature unless the curls are broad and synchronized in alignment as often occursin Curl types II and III.10.6.4 Shine Increases with Ellipticity but Decreaseswith Curvature and TwistsKeis et al. [ 59] worked with African American hair with an ellipticity index of 1.6frequently found in curl class IV. Keis, Ram and Kamath also concluded that in10.6 Hair Shine or Luster 681
addition to curvature, twists and kinks decreased luster because twists increase lightscattering. Keis et al. [ 59] found that by comparing single hair ﬁbers that werestraightened in the goniophotometer (to eliminate curvature) that luster increasedwith ﬁber ellipticity and with increasing pigmentation. They further demonstratedwith an 80 mm nylon ﬁber with an ellipticity index of 1.0 that when it wasmechanically ﬂattened to increase the ellipticity from 1.0 to 1.35 to 7.0 that lusterincreased because the amount of scattered light decreased. This luster effect occursbecause specular light is reﬂected from the surface of the ﬁber and light that entersthe ﬁber is scattered by reﬂecting off of irregularities on the ﬁber interior.Apparently this effect of ellipticity on improving luster is smaller at highercurvatures than the misalignment effect at higher curvatures, because assembliesof such hair ﬁbers (Curl type IV–VIII) are generally less shiny than well aligned
wavy or straight assemblies of hairs (Curl types I–III) of lower ellipticity. There-fore, Keis et al. [ 59] agreed with Robbins C2hypothesis [ 6,42] that when curvatureis high, it dominates luster as it does with other physical properties in its inﬂuenceon hair assembly behavior.In a single hair method or in an assembly, shine is always more apparent alongthe ﬁber axis than across it (Fig. 10.23 ). When the incident light is in the scaledirection, reﬂectance is at a maximum, and scattering is less than it is in the “againstscale” direction [ 55]. The shine of the surface may appear different when illumi-nated and viewed from grazing angles as opposed to larger angles where highlightsare more prominent (see Fig. 10.23 ).10.6.5 Dark Hair (Natural or Dyed) is Shinier than Lighteror Gray HairDark hair often appears shinier than lighter hair. This is because part of the light isreﬂected at the ﬁber surface, and part enters the ﬁber and is scattered by reﬂecting
off irregularities of the interior. When that light reemerges, the diffuse componentis increased. If the ﬁber is colored or dyed, some of this diffuse component isabsorbed before reemerging, thus reducing it and making the ﬁber appear shinier[45]. This effect is depicted in Fig. 10.24 , comparing light-scattering curves for adark Brown hair and a blond hair ﬁber, and has already been described.Keis et al. [ 61] studied the effect of natural hair pigmentation on hair luster usinga goniophotometer. This study conﬁrmed that increasing hair color reduces lightscattering and increases luster. These same scientists examined dyed hair and founda similar but more complicated picture. Dye composition, concentration and pene-tration depth must be taken into consideration to account for the results. In addition,the luster of hair of different colors is perceived differently by the human eyeadding further complications.
There is less pigment in gray hair than in dark hair. Most likely the pigmentgranules of gray hair are also smaller in size, both actions a result of changes in the682 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
melanization process with ageing. Nagase et al. [ 62] found that hair with a porousmedulla gives a whitish appearance with less luster. These air spaces increase thescattering of light due to a change in refractive index at the hair to air interfacecreating a gray or whitish appearance. This effect is analogous to the one in thegenetic abnormality of pili annulati or ringed hair. Pili annulati appears as bands orrings of silver or gray and dark regions along the axis. Musso [ 63] working withguidance from RDB Fraser observed that ringed hair contains bands or areas withair spaces in the cortex along the axis. These air spaces correspond to the silver orgray bands. The air spaces are believed to be caused by a defect in the synthesis ofthe microﬁbril-matrix complex in the cortex with less of it being produced. There-fore, cavities or air spaces are created in the hair [ 63]. So, gray hair with a porousmedulla appears whiter than the same hair without a medulla.
10.6.6 Shampoos, Sebum, and Hair ShineSchebece and Scott (private communication), using a light-scattering techniquedemonstrated that sebum de-lusters hair and soap-containing shampoos diminishhair shine. The soap effect can only be seen when hardness is present, but it can bedetected in hardness as low as 100-ppm and lower (Table 10.9). Thompson andMills [ 54] found a similar effect with soap-containing shampoos at 300-ppmhardness. More recently we found such effects with soap-containing shampoos at60–80-ppm hardness.The data of Table 10.9 show that sebum dulls hair and that soap depositsfrom shampoos also de-luster hair. Similar dulling effects may be observed aftershampooing hair with a shampoo containing cationic polymer ingredients(Schebece and Scott, private communication). These deposits are often not uniformon the hair surface. Therefore, they can increase diffuse scattering; however,decreases in the specular component may also be seen with increasing deposition
of some conditioning ingredients.10.6.7 Hair Sprays Decrease the Shine of Single HairsSchebece and Scott (private communication) examined several commercial hairsprays for hair luster before and after soaking ﬁbers in different concentrations ofTable 10.9 Effects of shampoos on hair shine (specular/diffuse scattering)aStep 1: Oily hair from scalp containing only sebaceous soil 0.411Step 2: Wash with commercial soap containing shampoo 0.466Step 3: Wash with commercial TEALS based shampoo 0.538aWashing and rinsing in 100-ppm hardness water.

the product concentrates. In all cases, the specular/diffuse reﬂectance ratiosdecreased (from 2% to 14%) depending on the concentration and type of resinused. Combing and other physical manipulations of the resin on the hair producedcracks in the hair spray resins, increasing the diffuse scattering and further dullingthe hair. A method for hair assemblies is required to determine if the additionalimprovement in hair alignment by hair spray deposits will compensate for theincrease in diffuse scattering.10.6.8 Permanent Waves and Visual Assessment of Hair ShineDark brown hair tresses were treated with a commercial home wave and thenvisually assessed by panelists as slightly less shiny than the untreated control.A color shift to a slightly lighter shade was also noted. This shine change is believedto be due to an actual dulling of the ﬁbers rather than to curvature or alignmentchanges.10.6.9 Oxidation of Hair and Visual Assessment of Hair Shine
A group of ﬁve subjects were treated half-head-style with a surface oxidativetreatment (diperisophthalic acid described in Chap. 5). This treatment oxidizedthe hair surface but did not penetrate to the cortex. Therefore, no pigment wasoxidized and no color change occurred. Both subjects and independent observersthrough 1 month after treatment made shine evaluations. Independent observers allagreed that the treated side was less shiny than the untreated side. However, onlyone subject could detect this de-lustering effect on her own hair. These resultssuggest that oxidative treatments, including hair bleaches, dull hair. In addition,independent observers are more sensitive to hair shine changes on heads than self-evaluation of hair shine. Oxidative treatments that lighten the hair will decrease hairshine.10.6.10 Abrasion of Hair Decreases Hair ShineSchebece and Scott (private communication) abraded hair ﬁbers against a smooth
Bakelite surface in one experiment (Fig. 10.26 ) and against a 50- mm tungsten wirein another. The data show that surface abrasion decreases hair shine (specular/diffuse reﬂectance). This dulling effect increased with increasing abrasion. Incertain instances, the total amount of reﬂected light and the specular componentboth increased. The specular/diffuse ratio always decreased. These results suggestthat teasing (back-combing) hair and other abrasive actions such as vigorous684 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
combing or brushing can de-luster the hair by breaking scale edges and creatingmore irregularities on the ﬁber surface. These actions dull hair by increasing diffusescattering.10.7 Hair Body10.7.1 Body Deﬁnition and its Relationship to Single FiberPropertiesHair body is deﬁned in the textile trade as that compact, soft, or ﬁrm-feel of textilestock or fabric [ 64]. It is a tactile property. With regard to human hair, body may bedeﬁned as thickness or apparent volume of a hair assembly, involving sight andtouch for assessment [ 1]. The quality of liveliness or springiness [ 65] is alsoassociated with hair body. Hough et al. [ 36] deﬁned body as the structural strengthand resiliency of a hair mass, which is consistent with the above deﬁnitions.Body is a complex characteristic involving several single-ﬁber properties,
including friction, stiffness, curvature, cross-sectional area or diameter, weight,and length (Table 10.10 ). If we consider changes instead of absolute values for hairbody, it permits us to neglect properties that are not changed by cosmetic treatmentFig. 10.26 Electronmicrograph of a hair ﬁbermechanically abraded byrubbing against another hair.Note cuticle abrasion and hairfragments on the hair surface10.7 Hair Body 685
such as hair density on the scalp and ﬁber length. Thus considering changes bytreatments simpliﬁes the analysis. This approach suggests that if one makes theﬁbers stiffer, increases their diameter or curvature, or increases the frictional forcesbetween the ﬁbers, hair body will increase.Hough et al. [ 36] used a slightly different approach and concluded that ﬁvegroups of fundamental parameters govern hair body:1. Hair density on the scalp2. Stiffness3. Diameter4. Fiber interactions5. CurvatureThus, increasing hair density on the scalp, stiffness, diameter, or curvature
increases hair body. For ﬁber interactions, the effects depend on the nature of theinteractions. Obviously, these two independent approaches are related, and bothlead to the conclusion that hair body can be studied systematically through single-ﬁber properties. However, if we consider only the changes that can be made to hairﬁbers by cosmetic treatments, then curvature has the greatest impact on hair body.Furthermore, if curvature is high it can dominate changes in hair body as it can formost consumer hair assembly properties as predicted by the C2hypothesis.10.7.2 Methods to Evaluate Hair BodySeveral laboratory methods have been described to characterize hair body [ 37,67–76]. The Tolgyesi omega loop method [ 66] examines structural strength of ahair assembly, emphasizing the bending properties of an assembly more than thefrictional properties of the ﬁbers. One method that emphasizes frictional behavior
but attempts to measure the bulk of hair ﬁbers is the cylinder method of Scott andRobbins [ 69]. This method involves randomly dropping 1–2 in. hair ﬁbers into agraduated cylinder. Fibers with higher inter-ﬁber friction tend to provide a largervolume and therefore more body.The method of Clarke, Robbins and Reich uses image analysis to approximatethe volume of hair tresses [ 72]. This is probably the best of all current hair bodyTable 10.10 How single ﬁber properties of hair relate to hair body [ 1,2]Increase in these ﬁber properties produces an increasein hair bodyIncrease in these ﬁber properties producesa decrease in hair bodyCurvatureaCohesionaFriction WeightStiffnessDiameterNote: Fiber length is not considered, since it is not changed by cosmetic treatmentsaRelatively large effect predicted686 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
methods. The Textile Research Institute’s (TRI) method [ 68] involves transversecompression of a bundle of ﬁbers to determine the compressibility and recoverybehavior of hair tresses. Garcia and Wolfram [ 70] considered the force or worknecessary to pull hair tresses through a Teﬂon ring. Here the net force is acombination of ﬁber bending and ﬁber-ﬁber and ﬁber-ring friction. But it is notclear with either of these two methods which parameter or combination ofparameters correlates best with hair body. TRI suggests that their method isintended to measure the “tactile component of hair body as it is reﬂected in theresistance that hair offers to compression.”Another approach, by Robbins and Crawford [ 73], is a modiﬁcation of theGarcia-Wolfram method. In this system, the bulk of a hair assembly is assessedby measuring the work required to pull the tress through a succession of very thin
(0.076 cm) circular templates of decreasing diameter. A plot of work values vs.circle diameter is extrapolated to zero work to obtain the “maximum tress diame-ter.” This parameter appears to be a measure of the bulk of hair assemblies.Dr. G. Blankenburg et al. (private communication) of the German Wool ResearchInstitute has independently developed a similar method using this principle.The Robbins and Crawford [ 73] method estimates the visual or volume compo-nent of hair body with some contribution from springiness or compressibility andresilience of the hair assembly. This measure of hair body shows that bodyincreases with increasing amounts of hair, with increasing ﬁber curvature andwith increasing inter-ﬁber friction.Robbins and Crawford [ 73] examined hair of different curvatures by water
setting Curl type II Caucasian hair in different conﬁgurations by curling hair tresseson glass rods and also by braiding hair tresses. They used the ratio of the coiledlength of the hair to its extended length (Lc/Lt) as a measure of hair curvature. Thisratio is the reciprocal of the natural to straight length described by Hardy [ 48]a sameasure of hair curvature. As the number of braids increased the size of the braidpattern decreased providing a curlier-kinkier tress. The results showed that thelarger number of smaller curls (curly to kinky hair) was more effective in producinghair body by this method than the larger curls.Clarke, Robbins and Reich [ 72], questioned 150 panelists (Caucasian womenand men) and found that only 15% of these consumers use the word stiff to describehair body, but volume, bounce and thickness were used by 90 some percent of thepanelists. This consumer research suggested that both visual and texture analysis
are involved in hair body and that hair assembly volume is the primary factor invisual analysis by consumers.To measure the visual component of hair body, Clarke et al. [ 72] evaluated fourimages of each tress by rotating the tress 90/C14for each image and comparing theresults with images from a standard hair tress. Three types of hair were used, Asian,Caucasian and African American. All hair was made into tresses (1–6 g). The Asianand Caucasian hair was permanent waved to different degrees to provide a widerange of visually different tress volumes ranging from Curl type I to Curl type V.The initial results of measured tress volumes were compared with evaluations bypanelists who visually estimated hair body.10.7 Hair Body 687
The highly coiled African American hair (Curl type V) caused confusion amongthe Caucasian panelists, some judging these tresses to represent very little bodywhile others rated them with very high body. Nevertheless, there was still a highlysigniﬁcant rank correlation (Rho ¼0.865 and p <0.001) between hair volumeby image analysis and panelists visual rankings of hair body. However, when thedata for the African American hair was excluded the correlation improved toRho¼0.975 and p <0.001. Unfortunately, a panel of African Americans wasnot assembled to determine if their perceptions would provide the same or adifferent result from that of the Caucasian panelists. Nevertheless, theseexperiments show that the volume component of hair body does increase withhair ﬁber curvature from Curl type I–IV when Caucasian perceptions are involved.Furthermore, the volume component of hair body increases with actual hair ﬁbercurvature over the entire curvature scale.
curvature over the entire curvature scale.Robbins [ 42] demonstrated that the cohesive effects of oils such as syntheticsebum have a “much greater impact” by substantially decreasing hair volume forwavy Curl type II hair than for high curvature Curl type V hair. The effect wasrelatively small for this curly type hair. From these experiments with cohesive oilson hair volume vs. curvature, Robbins concluded that at high curvatures the effectof ﬁber curvature on hair volume is dominant. It clearly has a greater impact thanchanges in other ﬁber properties such as cohesive forces, ﬁber friction or stiffness.Such dominance likely begins in Curl types IV and increases through curl Type VIIIand is consistent with the C2hypothesis.Dr. Hans Dietrich Weigmann (private communication) suggested from his workon compressibility and body of hair assemblies [ 68] that ﬁber curvature was the
most important controlling property to their measurement of hair body. In addition,Dr. Mario Garcia (private communication) offered privately from his body methodon hair compressibility and resiliency of tresses [ 70] that ﬁber curvature was clearlythe most important ﬁber property to these important aspects of hair body. This workreinforces the hypothesis [ 6,42] that at a high degree of curvature (curl type IVthrough VIII), curvature dominates most hair assembly properties, but at lowcurvatures it displays lesser effects.10.7.3 Treatment Effects and Hair BodyPermanent waves and hair bleaches are known to increase hair body; however, themechanisms of action of these products are different. Permanent waving increaseshair body by increasing both ﬁber curvature and ﬁber friction [ 74,75]. Both of theseeffects increase hair body (see Table 10.10 ). Bleaching hair does not increase hairﬁber curvature, but it increases inter-ﬁber friction [ 75,76].
On the other hand, creme rinses are purported to make curly to straight hair limp.Pomades are heavy leave-on oils that aid in combing and managing African typehair, but they do not make highly coiled African type hair limp. Limpness is theinverse of hair body. This effect is probably due to the fact that creme rinse688 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
ingredients decrease inter-ﬁber friction [ 74,75]. Some cre `me rinses display mildcohesive effects too, especially on low curvature, ﬁne hair.Conditioner sets are an interesting category, because some of these productsincrease hair body. At the same time, conditioner sets make hair comb easier. Sucheffects probably arise because these products reduce high-load friction when thehair is being combed wet (or even when dry). Upon drying, some conditioner setsincrease low-load friction and or adhesive forces between ﬁbers. Certain hair spraysbehave in this same manner. Increases to the “apparent” ﬁber diameter are alsopossible for conditioner sets and hair sprays when they are well distributed through-out the hair.Shampoos vary in their effects on hair body. High-cleaning shampoos increasethe body of dirty (greasy) hair by removing oily soils. These effects decrease
cohesive forces between ﬁbers and increase inter-ﬁber friction. On the otherhand, continued use of conditioning shampoos can lead to limp hair by reducinginter-ﬁber friction and increasing cohesive effects between hairs. These effects aresimilar to the action of creme rinses. This limpness effect is greatest for straight,ﬁne hair and least for very curly to kinky hair.10.8 Relative Scalp Coverage or Hair AmountRobbins and Dawson et al. [ 7] described the effects of diameter and hair density(hair counts) on age and proposed a new metric “relative scalp coverage” for theperception of the amount of hair. This parameter or modiﬁcation of it may ulti-mately ﬁnd use for quantitation of the perception of the onset or different stages offemale pattern alopecia and male pattern alopecia.When considering only diameter and density this metric is deﬁned as a two
dimensional parameter as the average ﬁber cross-sectional area times the number ofhair ﬁbers per square centimeter. In its simplest form, when considering onlydiameter and density for female Caucasians, relative scalp coverage peaks atabout age 35 [ 7]. This peak age is produced because hair diameter increases untilabout age 45 but density peaks in the late twenties. So, when these two importantcontributors to scalp coverage are combined, they provide a maximum for relativescalp coverage for Caucasian females at age 35. The average age for relative scalpcoverage for males would be lower, likely in the twenties, since hair diameter formales peaks at about twenty and hair density if it is similar to females peaks in thelate twenties.Robbins and Dawson et al. proposed that when other important ﬁber parametersare considered for relative scalp coverage, it will have to be considered as a multi
dimensional system involving diameter, density, ﬁber curvature, ﬁber length, color(hair and scalp) and style and it can relate very much to a hair body metric. SinceMirmirami and Dawson [ 77] have shown scalp site produces different effects ondiameter and density, scalp site will also have to be considered for a more completemodel.10.8 Relative Scalp Coverage or Hair Amount 689
10.9 Style Retention10.9.1 Style Retention Deﬁnition and its Relationship to SingleFiber PropertiesStyle retention may be deﬁned as the ability of hair to stay in place after styling [ 1].It is time-dependent and includes curl retention, wave retention, and straightnessretention. Style retention may be described in terms of single-ﬁber properties or itmay be treated as an assembly property. Style retention is most important to manyhair products including permanent waves and hair sprays as well as to conditionersets or wave sets, setting gels and to mousses.When a hair ﬁber is thoroughly wet with water and allowed to dry it willgradually revert to its natural curvature. For example, a curly hair will assume acurly or coiled conﬁguration, whereas a straight hair ﬁber will assume a straightconﬁguration. This property of hair ﬁbers to assume their natural curvature iscentral to the STAM method for curvature assignment [ 35,78,79]. If hair is wet
with water and held and dried in a pattern different than its natural curvature it willtend to remain in that conﬁguration until rewet or exposed to a different relativehumidity. This type of action is the basis of water setting human hair.Some heating devices such as blow dryers or hot air straighteners or curlingdevices are sometimes used to speed up the drying process and to facilitate stylingby way of a water set. These devices provide only temporary effects because theprimary bonds that help hold the hair in this type of water set conﬁguration arehydrogen bonds and they can be broken by water or exposure to changes inhumidity whereupon the hair ﬁber reverts to its natural curvature.It has been known for years that exposing water set hair to higher humidity causesthe hair to revert to its natural curvature and the water set decreases. Diaz et al. [ 80]
demonstrated that exposure of a tress of water set hair to a lower humidity can alsoproduce a loss of water set. Robbins and Reich [ 81] showed that water setting singlehair ﬁbers into a coiled conﬁguration at 60% RH and then exposure to 10% RHproduces a greater loss in style retention than similar single hairs water set and held at60% RH. The use of single hairs in this experiment demonstrates that this effect issolely an effect of water on the curvature (internal bonding) of the hair ﬁbers and doesnot involve inter-ﬁber friction. These results show that changes in RH are detrimentalto water set in human hair ﬁbers and it is not just exposure to higher humidity.Therefore the transfer of water into (higher RH) or out (lower RH) of the hair
ﬁber results in breaking hydrogen bonds that are involved in a water set and such anaction produces a loss in the water set. As with other hair assembly properties, styleretention can be dominated by hair ﬁber curvature [ 6,42]. Conﬁrmation of thisconclusion is the fact if a person with high curvature hair (Curl type IV–VIII)wishes to wear a straight type hair style that type of style is difﬁcult to achieve witha water set. However, if a person with straight hair, for example, Curl type I or IIwishes to wear a curly hair style, to a limited degree, this can be done with a waterset supplemented by hair sprays.690 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
However, making the natural curvature consistent with the optimum curvaturefor the desired style is the best way to achieve these effects. There are permanent,semi-permanent and short term treatments to achieve this type of goal. For curlyhair styles reductive permanent waves are semi-permanent treatments. With theproper size and shape curlers these treatments can provide coiled hair from rela-tively straight hair in a semi-permanent manner. Furthermore, a permanent waveprovides better style retention for a highly coiled style from straight hair than bywater setting because for such a style the most important property is hair ﬁbercurvature. The same applies for providing a relatively straight hair style from highly
coiled hair. Furthermore, providing for straight hair styles from highly coiled hair,the only permanent treatments are alkaline straighteners. The more important ﬁberproperties that are related to style retention are curvature, friction, stiffness, cohe-sion, and weight [ 1,2]. Table 10.11 suggests that increasing ﬁber stiffness andweight will decrease style retention. However, for straight hair styles, increasingweight improves style retention. The role of weight is straightforward; that ofstiffness is more subtle. Hair ﬁbers are generally water-set to produce an optimumcurvature for the desired style. The desired style sometimes differs from the naturalcurvature of the hair. Changes in humidity promote deterioration of the water setand a gradual change toward the hair’s natural curvature [ 81]. Only friction and
cohesive forces tend to hold the assembly in the desired style preventing the hairfrom reverting to its natural curvature. The stiffer the ﬁbers, the more readily theytend to overcome these frictional forces and the desired style. Thus, increasing ﬁberstiffness decreases style retention for water set hair.The maximum ﬁber curvature consistent with the desired style will produce theoptimum number of entanglements and the optimum ﬁber-ﬁber interactions andthus the maximum style retention. Generally, an increase in ﬁber curvatureincreases style retention. However, if the desired style is considerably straighterthan the natural curvature, then a decrease in ﬁber curvature will be necessary toimprove style retention (hair straighteners or relaxers). The converse holds forstyles that are curlier than the natural curvature of the hair.10.9.2 Methods Relevant to Style Retention
10.9.2 Methods Relevant to Style RetentionMost companies involved in hair products have developed their own procedures forevaluating curl or wave retention of hair assemblies (tresses, wigs, or heads).Table 10.11 How single ﬁber properties of hair relate to style retention [ 1]Increase in these ﬁber properties produces a decreasein style retentionIncrease in these ﬁber properties producesan increase in style retentionCurvatureaFriction (low load)Stiffness CohesionWeightbCurvatureaaA curvature increase can increase or decrease style retention (see text)bOnly for curly to wavy hair styles. For straight styles increasing weight increases style retention10.9 Style Retention 691
Laboratory procedures also vary, depending on the type of product to be evaluated.Differences in application of hair sprays and permanent waves and the difference inperformance characteristics require different procedures. The extent of quantitationmay also vary. For example, Reed [ 82] described the evaluation of permanent-waving agents by simply treating tresses wound on curlers and qualitative evalua-tion of the hair for “curl strength” after removal from the curlers. Other, morequantitative approaches involve calculation of percent curl retention [ 83] or percentwaving efﬁciency or measuring curl strength [ 84–86].Basically, curl retention procedures involve treatment of a tress of known length,winding it on a mandrel or a rod or around pegs, and drying or conditioning it. Afterremoving the hair from the rod, either length measurements vs. time (undercontrolled humidity) are taken to arrive at percent curl retention. Alternatively,
the hair is placed on water and the change in elongation provides a means to obtainpercent waving efﬁciency for cold wave lotions [ 84,85].The curl strength method of Stravrakas et al. [ 86] is an interesting option. Thismethod involves treating hair, curling it on rods, conditioning it at high humidity.The researcher then determines the resistance to the deformation of curls and wavesby the hair treatment using an Instron tensile tester or another strain gauge device.This method provides a large variance; however, it can distinguish between coldwaves, hair sprays, and water-set hair.For hair sprays or hair ﬁxatives, several techniques have been described toevaluate curl-holding ability under conditions of controlled humidity [ 87,88].One novel approach [ 88] involves the rate of untwisting of tresses treated withthe hair ﬁxative. This method correlates with curl retention tests, yet it allows forfaster evaluation of treatments.
Robbins [ 89] used a single ﬁber method for determining curl retention orstraightening. This method offers advantages when used in conjunction with aﬁber assembly method (tress method), since it eliminates ﬁber-ﬁber interactionsfrom curvature and stiffness changes. It consists of uniformly winding a single hairﬁber of known length onto a glass rod, treating it with water or product, andconditioning the hair at a controlled humidity (generally 50–65% RH). The ﬁberis then removed from the rod and conditioned at different RH’s. Changes in lengthwith time are measured with a cathetometer. See Chap. 4for a discussion of some ofthe results with this method regarding water setting hair.10.9.3 Style Retention and Hair Treatments
10.9.3 Style Retention and Hair TreatmentsPermanent waving or relaxing of hair improve style retention when the degree ofcurl is made more consistent with the desired hair style. Obviously, the type andsize of rollers (curlers) in permanent waving are important in determining the ﬁnalresult. The roller dimensions should be consistent with the curvature required by thedesired hairstyle. Permanent waving increases inter-ﬁber friction [ 75] which alsocontributes to improve style retention, especially low load friction.692 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
Bleaching increases inter-ﬁber friction [ 75,76] which helps to improve styleretention. Most conditioner or creme rinse ingredients [ 76], in contrast to bleaches,provide a decrease in inter-ﬁber friction. Except for some straight hair styles, manyhair conditioners decrease style retention.Conditioner sets, setting lotions, mousses, and hair sprays all increase low loadinter-ﬁber attractive forces that help to improve style retention. These effects aregreater than that of the weight increase by these ingredients which in some casestend to decrease style retention.Cleaning shampoos, when used on hair containing sebaceous soil, remove thesurface oils and thereby reduce the cohesive bonding between ﬁbers. Theseproducts thus provide an improvement in style retention for “dry look” hair styles.Certain conditioning shampoos provide a decrease in ﬁber friction and an increase
in cohesive bonding. In that manner, they provide for a limp look and a decrease instyle retention for many hair styles.10.10 Hair Manageability10.10.1 Hair Manageability Deﬁnition and Single FiberPropertiesAs deﬁned earlier, manageability is the ease of arranging hair in place and itstemporary ability to stay in place; long-term effects on hair ﬁber assemblies are notconsidered for this property. Manageability is such an inclusive term that it cannotbe measured by one single procedure.As indicated earlier, Robbins et al. [ 4] concluded that three properties werestrongly and signiﬁcantly associated with manageability: easier combing, reducingstatic ﬂyaway and keeping hair in place during styling operations. Garcia and Diaz[9] even earlier pointed out that “combability is closely associated with manage-ability” and Mills, Ester and Henkin [ 43] referred to the importance of static chargeand ﬂyaway hair to manageability.
and ﬂyaway hair to manageability.Robbins et al. [ 4] found that manageability was perceived differently by differ-ent persons and by different hair types. They proposed that hair type and the desiredhair style were critically important to the manageability properties expected byconsumers. Furthermore, the “curvature of a hair type is obviously associated withthe degree of curliness of a hair style and is perhaps the most important of these”three properties. They suggested that when the hair type, curvature, length andtexture of the hair match the desired hair style, manageability problems areminimized. However, when the hair type does not match the desired hair stylethen manageability problems are maximized.Since combing ease, ﬂyaway hair and style retention (short term, i.e. duringstyling) are all components of hair manageability and because these three hairassembly properties are all dominated by curvature the logical conclusion is that10.10 Hair Manageability 693
ﬁber curvature dominates many manageability issues. For example, when curvatureis high and it matches the desired hair style then manageability will be concernedprimarily with combing or picking the hair to the desired style. In that situation,style retention concerns will be minimized, and ﬂyaway hair will be of concernprimarily for straight to wavy hair but not for very curly hair. However, when thecurvature is low and a high curvature hair style is desired then style retentionconcerns will be higher. So, the further the natural curvature of the hair is fromthe optimum curvature of the desired style the greater the issues with style retentionmanageability. The closer the natural curvature is to the desired style the fewerissues with style retention and the more issues with combing/brushing/picking orwith ﬂyaway hair; however, ﬂyaway hair is not an issue with high curvature hairsuch as Curl types IV–VIII, but becomes more of an issue as the natural curvature ofthe hair decreases.
the hair decreases.Therefore to enable a quantitative approach to manageability, Robbins et al. [ 4]recommended considering this important cosmetic property in terms of its compo-nent assembly properties that can be readily visualized and measured. So, manage-ability is concerned with:Arranging hair in place (combing/brushing),Keeping hair in place (style retention during styling), andFlyaway hair.Therefore, the suggestion was made [ 4] to consider these three types of manage-ability to permit measurement and scientiﬁc evaluation, rather than the singleelusive term manageability:Style arrangement manageability (combing/brushing/picking),Style retention manageability (style retention when styling), andFlyaway hair manageability.Existing tests to evaluate hair-combing ease, style retention, and ﬂyaway hair or
static charge may then be used to evaluate these different types of manageability.Furthermore, each type of manageability may be expressed in terms of a ratio ofcontrol/treatment values.Using this approach, those single ﬁber properties deﬁned in Table 10.11 thatimprove combing ease will also improve style arrangement manageability, whilethose properties of Table 10.11 that improve style retention will improve styleretention manageability. Similarly, those parameters described in the previoussection, which decrease static charge on hair, will improve ﬂyaway hair manage-ability and thereby decrease static ballooning.Therefore, increasing ﬁber curvature, static charge, or high-load friction will
decrease style arrangement manageability. On the other hand, increasing low-loadfriction or cohesive forces between ﬁbers will improve style retention manageability.This means that a change in ﬁber curvature can either increase or decrease styleretention manageability. For example, if the treatment changes the curvature so that itis either too straight or too curly for the desired style, it will make the hair lessmanageable. However, if the treatment makes the hair curvature more consistent with694 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
the desired style, then that type of change will improve style retention manageability.Since ﬁber length is not changed by cosmetic treatments, length is not relevant forthis type of analysis which considers changes by cosmetic treatments.10.10.2 Treatment Effects and Hair ManageabilitySince style arrangement manageability and style retention manageability oftenoppose each other, the decision as to whether a given effect will improve manage-ability for any particular person’s hair depends on which of these two componentsof manageability is desired more. Since different persons will attach differentvalues to the three different types of manageability, it is very difﬁcult to predictoverall manageability. Moreover, it is preferable to discuss each of the three typesof manageability separately rather than to try to arrive at a composite for thisimportant cosmetic property.Permanent waving can increase style retention manageability when it provides
an amount of ﬁber curvature that is more consistent with the desired hair style.Permanent waving also increases low-load friction, thus improving style retentionmanageability. Permanent waves are generally used to increase ﬁber curvature,thereby increasing the number of possible entanglements and decreasing stylearrangement manageability. Increasing ﬁber friction also decreases style arrange-ment ease. Most satisﬁed users of permanent waves are more concerned with thestaying in place component of style retention manageability. Therefore, they feelthat after a permanent wave, their hair is more manageable. Those dissatisﬁed withthe style arrangement manageability of a permanent wave can decrease ﬁberfriction with a conditioner and thereby improve style arrangement manageability.Most conditioner ingredients decrease high-load friction [ 50,76], thus making
the hair comb easier thereby improving style arrangement manageability. At thesame time, quaternary conditioner ingredients decrease ﬁber chargeability. Thislatter effect, in combination with combing ease, decreases the propensity of theﬁbers to ﬂy away and thus improves ﬂyaway manageability. Most satisﬁed users ofconditioners are more concerned with style arrangement and ﬂyaway manageabilitythan with style retention manageability. Therefore, they conclude that their hair ismore manageable after using a conditioner. Pomades provide a decrease in highload friction and an increase in cohesive forces between ﬁbers. Those satisﬁed usersof pomades generally have high curvature hair and are satisﬁed with high curvaturehair styles. Therefore, these consumers do not have concerns with style retentionmanageability, but are more concerned with style arrangement manageabilitywhich is delivered better with pomade products than with ordinary rinse-off hairconditioners.
conditioners.Satisﬁed users of conditioner sets, setting lotions, pomades, and hair sprays aregenerally more concerned with style retention manageability. Therefore, theincrease in inter-ﬁber cohesive forces from these products more than offsets anydecrease in style arrangement manageability concerns.10.10 Hair Manageability 695
High-cleaning shampoos remove sebaceous oils and decrease cohesive forcesbetween the ﬁbers, thereby making the hair more conducive to “dry look” hair styles.These products increase frictional forces relative to dirty hair. These effects aid styleretention manageability for “dry look” styles. Satisﬁed users of these shampoos, whodo not use other hair products, are generally more concerned with these factors(related to how hair stays in place) than with style arrangement manageability. Usersof high-cleaning shampoos plus conditioners or high-conditioning shampoos aregenerally very concerned with improving style arrangement manageability andﬂyaway manageability for a “dry look” type of hair style.10.11 Hair Handle or FeelTactile properties of hair ﬁber assemblies such as softness, smoothness andmoisturization are important to advertising of hair products. But tactile properties
provide difﬁculty in assessment in and between different laboratories. Boucseinet al. [ 90] described that the use of psycho-physiological techniques aided discrim-ination of sensory assessments. For example measurement of peripheral bloodvolume and facial muscular activity were found to be more sensitive and discrimi-nating than ordinary sensory assessment to effects and interactions between emo-tional and technical responses to three different hair samples including twodifferent shampoos and one untreated control.Wortmann and Schwan-Jonczyk [ 91] working with a European Hair Products
Group conducted a study to determine how single ﬁber and hair collective prop-erties contribute to hair feel or handle. From a study on 4 hair types of Europeanhair braids, the bending properties of single ﬁbers interacting in the tress as a ﬁbercollective and ﬁber friction were found to be the most important ﬁber propertiesrelated to handle. Single ﬁber friction was determined by a capstan method on root,middle and tip sections of hairs. Signiﬁcant differences between hair types werefound for diameters, ellipticity, bending stiffness and friction. Handle or feel wasperceived as inferior when the hair was coarse and the bending stiffness was high.Friction was also important to feel especially in the tip regions of the hair. Hairperceived as ﬁne was soft and friction appeared to play less of a role than in hairperceived as coarse.Kawasoe et al. [ 92] added to these ﬁndings by showing that an increase in hair
ﬁber friction produces the perception of a more coarse texture for hair. Alteration ofthe hair surface by damaging treatments generally produces an increase in hair ﬁberfriction resulting in what is perceived as a more coarse texture for hair. Kawasoeet al. determined that hair damage is perceived as a more irregular or more variedscale pattern (as opposed to uniform but different scale heights and widths). Thisconclusion came from having consumers feel simulated cuticle structures on anartiﬁcial hair surface of engraved images of different scale patterns on polyimideplates. A highly varied or irregular scale pattern produced what is perceived as acoarse texture for hair.696 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
This conclusion is related to results of unpublished work where we bleached hairto different extents and had blindfolded female panelists evaluate hair tresses. Thehair was rated for coarseness and tested for friction. The greater the degree ofbleach damage, the higher the friction and the more coarse the ratings.We know that African type hair is elliptical, highly coiled, and larger in diameterthan Caucasian hair. It is also generally perceived and described as coarse hair.Asian hair on the other hand is the largest in diameter of the three major geo-racialgroups and it is the least coiled, the most circular and is usually characterized asstraight and coarse. However, quantitative studies by Nagase et al. [ 3] on thecurvature of hair ﬁbers from 230 Japanese women showed that about 53% ofJapanese women have straight hair and 47% have hair that varies from slightlywavy to what is perceived as frizzy. As indicated earlier, the peak in the distribution
for curvature was at Curl type II and extended to Curl type IV on the STAMcurvature scale. Frizzy Japanese hair is distinguished from curly hair by neighbor-ing hairs not being parallel or synchronized [ 3].These scientists concluded that there should be a positive correlation betweenhair ﬁber curvature and the perception of coarse hair, a reasonable conclusion.However, I could not ﬁnd data in the literature to either support or deny thisconclusion. This is an area that requires additional research.10.12 How Consumer Hair Assembly Properties Changewith AgeConsidering one variable at a time, it is easy to qualitatively predict the changes inConsumer Hair Assembly Properties (CHAP) with respect to age; however, unfor-tunately changes in hair properties with age do not happen one variable at a time.
In this section, we will discuss different stages of life considering the aggregateand/or individual changes in hair ﬁber properties and how these affect the CHAPin terms of the following ﬁve stages in the life of hair ﬁbers:Infancy to childhood: approximately the ﬁrst year of life.Childhood to puberty: about age 1–12.Puberty to young adult: about age 13–30.Young adult to middle age: about 31–45.Middle age to and including advanced age: approximately 45 and upward.10.12.1 Infancy to Childhood: Approximately the First Yearof LifeInfants hair is very ﬁne [ 93–95] (about 30 mm in diameter for infants, about 60 mmfor children and somewhat larger but highly variable for adult Caucasians). These10.12 How Consumer Hair Assembly Properties Change with Age 697
average ﬁber diameters tell us that the time-span of anagen (growth period) forinfants’ hair is shortest compared with children or adults until about age 20 (formales) and middle to advanced age (about 45 for females) when anagen starts tobecome shorter once again. Infants’ hair was found to be less elliptical (1.26 vs.about 1.37) in one study of Caucasian infants vs. children’s hair and about 1.38 foradult Caucasians. So, the hair of infant Caucasians is more round than children’s[93] or adults hair.The ﬁne hair of infants is lost by about the seventh month and is replaced by acoarser and longer hair which is generally replaced by an even coarser hair at about2–3 years of age [ 95]. The loss of hair tends to be randomly dispersed over thescalp; however, during infancy, Pecoraro et al. [ 94] suggested that the initial hairloss may occur in waves. Infants’ hair grows to only about 15 cm long compared
with the ﬁnal stage of children’s hair that can grow to about 60 cm and adults haircan grow even longer to about 100 cm see Chap. 1.Hair lipids are produced by two sources, the sebaceous glands, located in eachhair follicle and the hair matrix cells that produce the growing hair ﬁber. Thecholesterol level of forehead skin is low at birth, but it reaches a maximum atabout age 6. It then declines to near adult levels by age 9 [ 96]. Cholesterol isproduced primarily by the hair matrix cells and since sebum production is low ininfants and children, the cholesterol level in human hair ﬁbers is high duringinfancy and childhood when sebaceous lipids are low. Therefore, ﬁne hair ofCaucasian children tends to provide low hair body and is generally easy to combunless it is curly.I could not ﬁnd data on hair density of infants, but sources state that follicle
density is highest in the fetus and it decreases with increasing skin surfaceaccompanying growth of the head. Estim ates of the scalp surface area of adultsare about 350–400 cm2, while that of infants at birth would be approximately200–225 cm2. These scalp areas are approxima te dimensions of the head ofinfants vs. adults calculated from head dimensions found in the Merck ManualsOnline Medical Library [ 97]. Assuming a follicle dens ity of about 321 follicles/cm2for Caucasian adults [ 98] and assuming the only change is the surface area ofskin by growth, provides a scalp folli cle density for Caucasians of 565/cm2atb i r t h .B a s e do nd a t ab yS p e r l i n g[ 98] for African Americans t he follicle densitieswould be lower for that group and even lower for Asians from data by Tajimaet al. [ 99].10.12.2 Childhood to Puberty: Approximately Age 1–12During childhood, scalp hair ﬁber diameter nearly doubles and the maximum length
that the hair can grow to increases nearly fourfold from infancy to the ﬁrst few yearsof childhood. However, ﬁber ellipticity increases only a small amountin Caucasians from infancy to childhood [ 93]. This ellipticity effect is likely not698 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
meaningful in terms of CHAP. I could ﬁnd no literature on the hair curvaturechanges during this time period. There may be changes in hair color during this timeperiod.The large increase in hair ﬁber diameter from infancy will increase tensile andbending stiffness but torsional resistance of hair ﬁbers will decrease. Unless there isa noticeable increase in hair ﬁber curvature, the stiffness increase will add body tothe hair, making it fuller. The stiffness factor alone will tend to make the hair combeasier. The hair ﬁber diameter and length increases are due to longer anagen periodsand are clearly the most important changes (unless there is a large curvaturechange) in terms of hair body, style retention, etc.Hair tends to be relatively dry during childhood because of the low sebaceousoutput [ 100,101] with the composition of the hair lipids being high in cholesterol[102] and its esters while the percentages of squalene [ 102] and fatty acids [ 103] are
lower than in the hair of teenagers or adults.10.12.3 Puberty to Young Adult: Approximately Age 12–30During this stage there is approximately a 25% increase in scalp hair diameter andan increase of about 60% in the maximum length that the scalp hair ﬁber canachieve. The anagen period is frequently as long as 6 years during this phase of lifecompared to about 2–4 years in the previous stage. The diameter increase for malestends to peak near the late teenage years, however, for females it continues throughthis stage and into the next. Once again the most important missing informationin terms of hair behavior is the lack of data on changes in hair ﬁber curvature.Nevertheless, an increase in curvature of the hair of Japanese females has beenshown to occur from age 10 to 70 [ 104], but it appears to be a small and gradual
increase that appears to be a bit larger in advanced years. However, we cannoteven speculate as to whether this effect is sufﬁcient to affect the CHAP, thereforethis is a major gap in the hair ﬁber literature. I would expect a similar change inCaucasians hair too, although there is currently no evidence to support this conclu-sion at this time.The beginnings of male pattern alopecia (MPA) can initiate during the middlepart of this stage (about ages 19 or 20) for some Caucasian males, but it is normallya few years later for some Asians [ 105] and those of African descent, see Chap. 1.Female pattern alopecia (FPA) can initiate during the last part (late 20s) of thisperiod (see Chap. 1and references [ 108,109]) and it tends to begin earlier for
Caucasians than for Asians. Both of these conditions produce a decrease in thehair density (hair counts), but in spite of the decrease in hair density the average hairdiameters continue to increase for females, but decreases for males during thisstage [ 108–110]. By about age 30, MPA affects about 25% of Caucasian males seeChap. 1and reference [ 105], but only about 5% of Asian males and most of thoseAsians are in the early stages of MPA.10.12 How Consumer Hair Assembly Properties Change with Age 699
During this stage, FPA affects only about 8% of Caucasian women, but it affectsvirtually no Asian women as shown by Norwood [ 106] and Birch et al. [ 107] forCaucasians and Chap. 1for Caucasians and Asians. FPA occurs more in the topcentral part of the scalp and is more diffuse than MPA which initiates and tends toconcentrate more in the frontal and crown areas. The increase in hair ﬁber diameterduring this stage will increase tensile and bending stiffness, but it will decreasetorsional resistance of hair ﬁbers. These diameter and stiffness changes will tend toincrease hair body and to make the hair comb easier [ 2].There is a noticeable increase in hair greasiness for most persons during thisstage [ 100,101]. The greasiness effect is caused by both an increase in the amountand the composition of hair lipids. For example, the sebaceous lipids includingsqualene [ 102] and most fatty acids [ 103] and wax esters [ 101] increase in the hair
while those lipids that are produced in the matrix cells in the hair follicle includingcholesterol [ 102] and its esters decrease on and in the ﬁber.These lipid changes (alone) at the hair surface tend to decrease hair body andrequire more frequent shampooing to improve the overall appearance of the hair interms of hair matting and luster. For those with little or no MPA or FPA, the effectsof hair diameter, stiffness and surface lipid deposits are the most important changesthat occur during the ﬁrst few years of this stage. This conclusion assumes that thereare no changes in hair ﬁber curvature during this stage. Increases in hair ﬁberdiameter and stiffness will tend to increase hair body and combing ease. For thosewith noticeable MPA or FPA, regional changes in hair density and ﬁber diameterespecially during the latter part of this stage will tend to decrease hair body andcombing forces.The graying process initiates for some especially during the last decade of this
period. Therefore, hair color can change during the last 10 years of this period.A few gray hairs are noticed at about age 21–22 for dark haired Caucasians, at aboutage 25 for Caucasians with medium colored hair and at about age 26 for fair hairedCaucasians. By the age of 30 about one fourth of all Caucasians will have a smallamount of gray hairs [ 111,112], while about 20% of Asians and 15% of Africandescent will have begun graying [ 113].10.12.4 Young Adult to Middle Age: Approximately 31–45Hair density per unit area tends to gradually decrease during this stage [ 7,77,107]even for those with no noticeable MPA or FPA. This decrease in hair density shouldbe more rapid and more scalp-region speciﬁc for MPA than for FPA and it occurs ata faster rate in the frontal and crown sites for males. Nevertheless this effect is stillregion speciﬁcity with regard to hair count decreases with age for women [ 77] andmost likely for men too.
most likely for men too.At the beginning of this period, only about 8% of female Caucasians haveclinically observable hair loss, but at the end of this time period that number nearlydoubles [ 106,107]. The average hair density decrease for women not suffering700 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
from FPA is about 26 hair ﬁbers/cm2per decade or approximately 15% hair lossduring this period which is generally not detectable. Data from Birch et al. [ 107]o ntwo groups of women one group concerned about FPA and the other group notconcerned with FPA suggests that a 30% hair density decrease is borderlinedetectable. Therefore, it would appear that the hair loss in FPA must be abouttwo times this rate of hair loss over this same time period for some persons to beconcerned about FPA. This effect is likely due to the increase in hair diameterduring this stage for women.The subjective impression of alopecia among females is multi-factorial involv-ing hair density, hair ﬁber diameter and the often overlooked property of ﬁbercurvature. A 25–30% decrease in hair density is borderline detectable. If most of theﬁbers are ﬁne and straight the hair loss will likely be more noticeable than if the
ﬁbers are coarse and curly. The use of the new metric for relative hair coverage byRobbins and Dawson et al. [ 7] should become useful in improving our understand-ing of the perception of alopecia.At the beginning of this life period our data suggest that about one-fourth ofCaucasian men have Type II–VII (see Chap. 1, Table 1.5and Fig. 1.12) hair loss,while only about 6% have Type V–VII (see Chap. 1, Table 1.5and Fig. 1.12) hairloss. At the end of this stage about 46% of Caucasian men have Type III–VII hairloss and about 14% have type V–VII hair loss see Chap. 1and references [ 107,114–116]. On the other hand, less than 5% of Asian men have Type III–VII hair lossat the beginning of this period and about 12% have this same amount of hair loss atthe end of this stage [ 115,116]. I could not ﬁnd data for those of African descent.Approximately 5% of all Caucasians will be totally gray at the end of this period
while virtually no Asians or those of African descent will be totally gray during thisstage [ 111,112]. A little more than three fourth of all Caucasians, about two-thirdof all Asians and by deduction about ½ of African descent will have some gray hairby the end of this period [ 111–113].According to our sources on hair diameters vs. age, for females diametersgradually increase up to the end of this stage [ 108–110], but for males diameterscontinue to decrease [ 110]. Based on graphical data of smaller numbers ofCaucasians [ 108,109] I assume that a similar effect occurs for Caucasians andlikely for those of African descent; however, I could not ﬁnd sufﬁcient data toestimate quantitatively the extent of those changes for these geo-racial groups.The decrease in hair ﬁber diameter from the late teenage years upward for maleswill decrease tensile and bending stiffness but increase torsional resistance of hairs,
while the continued increase in diameter for females will increase tensile andbending stiffness. Males will also suffer larger regional decreases in hair density/unit area and therefore will suffer a greater loss in hair coverage and hair volumeand other evaluations of hair body from the diametric decrease. It is unfortunate thatwe know so little about hair ﬁber curvature changes with respect to age, however,there is one study that shows that the hair of Japanese women increases in curvaturefrom age 10 through 70. However, there is no data for Caucasians or Asians on haircurvature vs. age. Lipid levels do not appear to change to a large degree for mostCaucasians during this stage [ 100,101].10.12 How Consumer Hair Assembly Properties Change with Age 701
10.12.5 Middle Age to and Including Advanced Age:Approximately 45 and UpThe primary effects of a decrease in hair density and in ﬁber diameter over multipleregions of the scalp in MPA will continue from the previous stage [ 117] and willworsen during this stage. The percentage of male Caucasians suffering from MPAincreases during this time period from about 46% to about 70% see Chap. 1andreference [ 105]. Related effects will occur with those suffering from FPA duringthis stage because both hair density and diameter decrease during this stage. Theincidence of FPA in Caucasians is approximately 16% of women at the beginningof this stage and that percentage will double by age 75 see Chap. 1and thesereferences [ 106,107].Graying will further increase during this stage. Approximately 21% ofCaucasians will go from little gray to moderate gray and about 35–40% moreCaucasians will become totally gray during this time period see Chap. 1and
these two references [ 111,112]. Using the Tobin and Paus approximation [ 116];approximately 15% Asians and 10% of African descent will go from little gray tomoderate gray, about 30% Asians will become totally gray and about 25% ofAfrican descent will go totally gray during this time period.Major effects occur during and a few years prior to Menopause to the scalp hairof women including lower frontal scalp hair density [ 77] (on the frontal but notoccipital scalp), lower growth rates [ 77], lower hair ﬁber diameters [ 77] andchanges in the composition of hair lipids on and in the ﬁbers [ 100–102,118].Lower total sebum in post-menopausal women vs. pre-menopausal women alsooccurs [ 100,101].These changes in hair effects translate co llectively into lower hair greasinessand less softness and smoothness for post-menopausal women [ 118], andalthough there is a decline i n lipid levels for males it is substantially less than
for females [ 100,101]. The hair of post-menopausal women has also been shownto be less shiny than the hair of pre-menopausal women [ 118]. Whether thisdecrease in hair shine is due to a decrease in ﬁber alignment from an increase inhair ﬁber curvature as occurs with age in the hair of Japanese women [ 104]o rt oanother factor is not known. I would expec t an increase in ﬁber curvature wouldalso produce less synchronized waves or curl patterns with the end result being anincrease in hair frizziness [ 104].For males, the major effect during this stage appears to be a decrease both in hair
ﬁber diameter and density. We know that this effect occurs in all geo-racialpopulations, but the relative quantitative effects need to be determined. Thedecrease in hair ﬁber diameter will decrease tensile and bending stiffness andincrease torsional resistance of hair ﬁbers. The effects on ﬁber diameter in combi-nation with hair density produces a decrease in relative hair coverage in the frontal,parietal and crown areas of Caucasians and should produce changes in importantconsumer assessments such as a decrease in hair body and a reduction in combingforces which should be more apparent for men than for women.702 10 Deﬁnitions of Consumer Relevant Hair Assembly Properties
For women the regional decreases in ﬁber diameter and hair density is generallyless than for men, however there can be a meaningful decrease in hair density forwomen in the frontal and top central region of the scalp. In addition, the decrease inhair greasiness that would appear after a day or two or longer will tend to partlyoffset the decrease in hair body from a decrease in ﬁber diameter and stiffness forwomen except for the everyday shampooer. I would anticipate related effects oncombing ease, that is, the decrease in stiffness will tend to make the hair moredifﬁcult to comb [ 2]; however the decrease in hair density will tend to make the haircomb easier. I would guess that the hair density effect would be larger, howeverwhich effect is stronger is too difﬁcult to say without additional data.References1.
