Mesenchymal stem cells •Mesenchymal stromal cells •Microvesicles •Exosomes •Cellular therapyABSTRACTMesenchymal stem cell transplantation is undergoing extensive evaluation as a cellular therapy inhuman clinical trials. Because MSCs are easily isolated and amenable to culture expansion in vitrothere is a natural desire to test MSCs in many diverse clinical indications. This is exempliﬁed by therapidly expanding literature base that includes many in vivo animal models. More recently, MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), which include exosomes and microvesicles (MV), are beingexamined for their role in MSC-based cellular therapy. These vesicles are involved in cell-to-cellcommunication, cell signaling, and altering cell or tissue metabolism at short or long distances inthe body. The exosomes and MVs can inﬂuence tissue responses to injury, infection, and disease.
MSC-derived exosomes have a content that includes cytokines and growth factors, signaling lipids,mRNAs, and regulatory miRNAs. To the extent that MSC exosomes can be used for cell-free regen-erative medicine, much will depend on the quality, reproducibility, and potency of their production,in the same manner that these parameters dictate the development of cell-based MSC therapies.However, the MSC exosome’s contents are not static, but rather a product of the MSC tissue origin,its activities and the immediate intercellular neighbors of the MSCs. As such, the exosome contentproduced by MSCs appears to be altered when MSCs are cultured with tumor cells or in the in vivotumor microenvironment. Therefore, careful attention to detail in producing MSC exosomes mayprovide a new therapeutic paradigm for cell-free MSC-based therapies with decreased risk.

TEMCELLS 2017;35:851–858SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are being exploited as an experimental therapy for avariety of human diseases. Current dogma indicates that MSCs ameliorate disease via secretionof paracrine acting factors that limit inflammation, reprogram immune cells, and activateendogenous repair pathways. Recent studies indicate that MSCs also produce extra-cellularvesicles of varying sizes including exosomes that carry as cargo mRNAs, microRNAs, and pro-teins, and that horizontal transfer of this cargo induces nonautonomous changes that are thera-peutic. This manuscript reviews evidence that MSC-derived microvesicles/exosomes function asparacrine mediators in tissue repair and recapitulate to a large extent the therapeutic effectsof parental MSCs. It also discusses their role in reprogramming endogenous MSCs to generatea self-reinforcing malignant niche.INTRODUCTIONMesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are
Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) areone of the most commonly employed cell typesunder investigation as an experimental cell-based therapy for treating human diseases.There are over 600 clinical trials now listed atwww.clinicaltrials.gov utilizing MSCs. Their wide-spread use stems from their demonstratedpotency in a broad range of experimental animalmodels of disease and their excellent safetyproﬁle in humans. Nevertheless, the precisemechanism(s) of action of MSCs administered tohuman patients for a particular disease orcondition remains an area of intensive investiga-tion. Results indicate (Fig. 1) that MSCs play sev-eral simultaneous roles: limiting inﬂammationthrough releasing cytokines; aiding healing byexpressing growth factors; altering host immuneresponses by secreting immuno-modulatoryproteins; enhancing responses from endoge-nous repair cells; and serving as mature func-tional cells in some tissues such as bone. Thesemechanism are not mutually exclusive, and as
such it is anticipated that MSCs yield therapeu-tic effects by an orchestrated response thatis dictated by the unique pathophysiology of agiven disease.aDepartment of Molecular

SHIFTING PARADIGMSOver the years, our understanding of the nature and function ofMSCs has undergone a number of paradigm shifts. Initially char-acterized as osteogenic stem/progenitors [1, 2], MSC-basedtherapies were anticipated to augment the structure and func-tion of damaged or diseased tissues via direct cell replacement.Indeed, in animal studies the MSCs were effective in healingbone nonunions [3, 4] and in one of their ﬁrst clinical applica-tions, MSCs were shown to produce a measurable beneﬁt inbone strength and ambulation when administered to childrenwith osteogenesis imperfecta [5]. When MSCs are labeled anddelivered in vivo, they will migrate to sites of tissue injury suchas a brain lesion or cardiac infarct [6–8]. However, it soonbecame apparent that relatively few MSCs engrafted at thesesites of injury and studies in rodents and dogs conﬁrmed thatintravenously administered MSCs are caught in the capillaries of
the lung and most MSCs are largely cleared, but some do getthrough to the injured target tissue [9–12]. Despite these limita-tions, MSCs continued to yield short-term therapeutic beneﬁtsin a large number of disease models [13–17]. Although it hadbeen long-known that MSCs produced abundant growth factorsand cytokines [18–21], many of which modulate the immunesystem (summarized in [22, 23]), to reconcile these disparateﬁndings, the ﬁeld adopted the revisionist viewpoint that MSCsaffect tissue repair largely via their paracrine factors and stimu-lation of host cells, and not by cell replacement [24, 25]. Thisparadigm shift was spurred by studies demonstrating that cul-ture medium conditioned by MSCs produced therapeutic effectssimilar to delivery of the cells in rodent models of acute myocar-dial infarction [26] and lung injury [27, 28], and was further bol-stered by genomics data showing MSCs secrete a plethora of
biologically active proteins [29–31]. In 2007, a study by Timmerset al. [32] conﬁrmed earlier reports that medium conditioned byhuman embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived MSCs (hESC-MSCs)signiﬁcantly reduced infarct size in both pig and mouse modelsof myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury. An importantadvance made by this work was inclusion of size fractionationstudies that identiﬁed the active component in media withinthe 50–200 nm range. Subsequent bio-physical studies charac-terized the biologically active component as exosomes. Camussiand colleagues demonstrated that MSC derived microvesiclesprevented kidney injury [33, 34], and Lai et al. [35] reportedthat a homogeneous preparation of exosomes with a hydrody-namic radius of 55-65 nm reduced the infarct size in an ex vivomouse Langendorff heart model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury at a protein dosage equivalent to /C2410% of
the conditioned medium dosage. Herein, the nature of the invitro infarct model also ruled out any contribution from circulat-ing immune cells or platelets. These studies have fostered anintense research effort to better understand the nature andfunction of MSC-derived exosomes. While MSCs are known toexpress growth factors and cytokines, many of these proteinsdo not have signal peptides and their packaging along withmRNAs and miRNAs in membrane-bound vesicles explained, atleast partially, how MSCs exert multiple effects throughout thebody.Figure 1. MSCs play multiple roles. They can differentiate to multiple lineages and can participate in organized cell replacement thera-py but engraftment after delivery in vivo remains low. However, the MSCs produce many cytokines and growth factors that inﬂuenceother cells producing decreased inﬂammation, enhanced progenitor cell proliferation, improved tissue repair and decreased infection.

MSCs have also been shown to donate mitochondria via tunneling nanotubes to damaged cells. More recently, the MSC productionand release of membrane bound packets—microvesicles ( >200mm) and exosomes ( /C2450–200 mm)—that encapsulate cytokines/growthfactors/RNAs/miRNAs in diverse combinations. These vesicles are being tested in experimental systems previously tested with the cellsthemselves. Remarkably, the vesicle preparations have shown results very similar to MSC transplantation in many cases, while avoidingmany risks associated with cell transplantation. However, many important tasks remain before MSC-derived vesicle therapy can be usedclinically including standardized production, vesicle characterization, improving isolation and yield optimization, reproducibility, an assa yfor potency, determining dosage for particular clinical indication and standardized production—all similar to parameters needed for MSC
cell therapy.

EXOSOMES AND MICROVESICLES AS PARACRINE MEDIATORS INTISSUE REPAIRMost cells produce extracellular vesicles as a consequence ofintracellular vesicle sorting including both microvesicles of>200 nm and exosomes of 50-200 nm diameter. The microve-sicles are shed from the plasma membrane whereas exosomesoriginate from early endosomes and as they mature into lateendosomes/multivesicular bodies, they acquire increasingnumbers of intraluminal vesicles, which are released asexosomes upon fusion of the endosome with the cell surface[36, 37]. With respect to MSCs, most laboratories isolateexosomes/microvesicles from conditioned media via ultracentri-fugation (See Table 1) although a method based on chromatog-raphy has also been described [45], and characterize thesefractions based on their membrane protein content and/or car-go. For example, the tetraspanins, CD63, and CD81 are commonmarkers enriched in exosomes [69]. While the physiological
signiﬁcance and evolutionary consequence for producingextracellular vesicles and a detailed description of their physicalnature is beyond the scope of this review, these topics havebeen covered elsewhere [70–72].The majority of the published MSC exosome literature reca-pitulates in large part the nature and scope of that previouslydevoted to the study of MSC action in animal models of disease.For example, various groups have conﬁrmed that MSC-derivedexosomes exhibit cardio and renal-protective activity [32,42–44], are efﬁcacious in animal models of myocardial infarction[39–41], stroke [46], peri-natal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury[47], and hind-limb ischemia [62]. The MSC-derived exosomesalso ameliorated carbon tetrachloride-induced liver ﬁbrosis [50,51], and conferred cyto-protective effects in models of necrotiz-ing enterocolitis [58]. In lung studies, the mouse MSC exosomeswere effective in improving pulmonary hypertension [52, 53],
silicosis [54], and human MSC-exosomes improved endotoxin-induced pulmonary edema [55, 57], and cleared alveolar ﬂuidfrom human lungs ex vivo [56]. Other studies have shown thatMSC-derived exosomes also promoted re-epithelialization ofcutaneous wounds by inducing epithelial cell proliferation [60]and angiogenesis [73, 74], activated collagen and elastin secre-tion by ﬁbroblasts [61], and prevented myo-ﬁbroblast formationthereby reducing scaring [59]. The MSC-derived exosomesalso promoted muscle regeneration [63], protected againstexperimental colitis [75], and exhibited potent neuro-protectiveTable 1.

activities in neurons [64, 76] and in models of traumatic braininjury [45, 48]. MSC-derived exosomes are also immunologicallyactive based on evidence that they suppressed proliferationand IFN- gsecretion by T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 andanti-CD28 antibodies [77], and also enhanced the survival ofallogenic skin grafts in mice by enhancing T cell polarization to aregulatory phenotype [78]. A growing number of studies suggestthat MSC-derived exosomes mimic the ability of MSCs to inﬂu-ence the activity of immune effector cells including B, T, NK, den-dritic cells, and macrophages although not all studies showpositive effects [reviewed in [79]]. Collectively, these studiesreadily demonstrate that MSC-derived exosomes recapitulate toa large extent the immensely broad therapeutic effects previ-ously attributed to MSCs.However, while much effort has been devoted to demon-strating that MSCs and MSC-derived exosomes yield similar
therapeutic beneﬁts in various disease models, most studiesfall short of rigorously validating this hypothesis. For example,various groups have compared the potency of MSCs versusMSC-derived exosomes, and in some cases MSC conditionedmedia, in animal models of myocardial infarction [40], focalcerebral ischemia [49], gentamicin-induced kidney injury [43],and silicosis [54]. While most studies report that MSC-derivedexosomes are equally effective as MSCs in sparing tissue and/or promoting functional recovery from injury, this desired out-come is compromised by lack of appropriate controls, compa-rable dosing, evaluation of the different disease endpoints,variations in frequency and timing of dosage, and absence ofdose-dependent effects, thereby making it difﬁcult to drawconclusions about comparable efﬁcacy and potency. There isalso the issue of lability and whether freezing/thawing effectsexosome potency.MODE OF ACTION OF MSC-D ERIVED EXOSOMES
MODE OF ACTION OF MSC-D ERIVED EXOSOMESMSC-derived exosomes function largely via horizontal transferof mRNAs, miRNAs and proteins, which then function by avariety of mechanisms to alter the activity of target cells. Forexample, Tomasoni et al. [80] reported that transfer of IGF-1RmRNA from MSC-derived exosomes to cisplatin-damagedproximal tubular epithelial cells sensitized the epithelial cellsto the renal-protective effects of locally produced IGF-1. Withrespect to miRNAs, those contained within MSC-derived exo-somes have been shown to inhibit tumor growth [65, 66],reduce cardiac ﬁbrosis following myocardial infarction [81],stimulate axonal growth from cortical neurons [76], promoteneurite remodeling and functional recovery after stroke [82],and stimulate endothelial cell angiogenesis [83]. Furthermore,several studies have validated a direct role for exosome-derived miRNAs in modulating target cell function via use of
loss-of-function approaches [68, 82]. Other studies haveshown that exosomes secreted by bone marrow-derived MSCscontain cystinosin (CTNS), a cystine efﬂux channel in the lyso-somal membrane, and that coculture of ﬁbroblasts and proxi-mal tubular cells from cystinosis patients with MSC-derivedexosomes resulted in a dose dependent decrease in cellularcystine levels [84]. Additionally, Katsuda et al. [85] demon-strated that exosomes produced from adipose-derived MSCs(ADSCs) contain neprilysin, an enzyme that degrades the amy-loid beta peptide, and that coculture of N2a cells engineeredto overexpress human A bwith ADSCs signiﬁcantly reducedthe levels of secreted A b40 and A b42 by exosome-mediatedtransfer of neprilysin. A separate study by Amarnath et al.[86] reported that MSC-derived exosomes suppress human-into-mouse GvHD by inhibiting Th1 cell effector function via
the release of CD73 containing exosomes, which when takenup by CD39 expressing CD4 1Th1 cells resulted in enhancedadenosine production and increased Th1 cell apoptosis.Together, these studies indicate that dissecting the therapeutic
adenosine production and increased Th1 cell apoptosis.Together, these studies indicate that dissecting the therapeuticeffects of MSC-derived exosomes and their mechanism ofaction in vivo may be equally as challenging as determiningthat for the parent MSCs.EXOSOMES AND THE MSC N ICHEFUNCTIONIt is well-established that marrow resident MSCs play a criticalrole in retention of HSCs within the bone marrow niche [87],and alterations in MSC function may contribute to the patho-physiology of hematological diseases [88]. Consistent withthese ﬁndings, an increasing number of studies have shownthat exosomes secreted from leukemic cells reprogram MSCsto promote the development of a self-reinforcing malignantniche. For example, Munti /C19on et al. [89] found that that themiRNA cargo of exosomes was signiﬁcantly altered in marrow-derived MSCs harvested from myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS) patients when compared to disease-free patients, anduptake of these exosomes by normal CD34 1progenitorsenhanced cell viability and increased CFU-GM production. Thecargo of MSC-derived exosomes from acute myeloid leukemia(AML) patients was also shown to differ from normal patientsin that it contained elevated levels of miR155 and miR375,which independently identify AML patients at high risk forrecurrence, and conferred chemo-resistance to AML cellsagainst cytarabine and the FLT3 inhibitor AC220 [90].Exosomes recovered from the blood of CML patients carriedas part of their cargo the EGFR ligand amphiregulin (AREG),and coculture with HS5 stromal cells induced expression ofMMP9 and IL-8 by increasing EGFR signaling, resulting inincreased adhesion of leukemic cells to stromal cells [91].Similarly, exosomes released by primary chronic lymphocyticleukemia (CLL) cells reprogramed MSCs to adopt a cancer-associated ﬁbroblast (CAF) phenotype characterized predomi-
nantly by increased NF-kB signaling and elevated secretion ofcytokines and chemokines [92], which enhanced tumor cellsurvival in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Studies have alsoshown that exosome-mediated transfer of tumor associatedmiRNAs from multiple myeloma cells to MSCs stimulated thelatter to secrete higher levels of the myeloma survival factorsCXCL1, CCL5, and IL6 [93]. Moreover, MSC-derived exosomesfrom multiple myeloma patients were shown to expresshigher levels of oncogenic cytokines as compared to thosefrom normal patients and promote growth of tumor cell linesin vivo [67].While the role of exosomes in creating a leukemic niche isunder intensive study, their role within the bone marrowniche under healthy physiological conditions has only recentlygarnered attention. For example, Wen et al. [94] reportedthat extra-cellular vesicles (EVs) derived from bone marrowMSCs were capable of protecting Lin-hematopoietic progeni-
-hematopoietic progeni-tors from radiation-induced damage both in vitro and in vivo.854 MSC-Derived ExosomesVCAlphaMed Press 2017 STEMCELLS 15494918, 2017, 4, Downloaded from https://stemcellsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/stem.2575 by Cochrane Japan, Wiley Online Library on [26/09/2024].

Herein, exposure of Lin-cells to EVs after irradiation led to astatistically signiﬁcant ( p<.05) increase in their overallengraftment at 24 and 36 weeks post-transplant, and alsoenhanced engraftment when transplanted to secondary recipi-ents. Other studies have shown that MSC-derived exosomesstimulate bone regeneration in critical-sized calvarial defectsin ovariectomized rats [95], hyaline cartilage formation andrepair of osteochondral defects in rat femurs after repeatedintra-articular injections [96], and reversed defects in bonehealing due to impaired callus formation in CD92/2mice[97]. Last, Phinney et al. [98] recently demonstrated thathuman MSCs manage intracellular oxidative stress by target-ing depolarized mitochondria to the plasma membrane viaarrestin domain-containing protein 1-mediated microvesicles,that these vesicles are engulfed and reutilized by macro-phages, and that MSCs simultaneously shed miRNA-containing
exosomes that inhibit macrophage activation by suppressingToll-like receptor signaling thereby de-sensitizing macrophagesto the ingested mitochondria.NOTALLMSC-D ERIVED EXOSOMES ARE CREATED EQUALAs is the case with MSC-based therapies, studies indicatethat not all MSC-derived exosomes are equivalent. Forexample, Katsuda et al. [85] reported that exosomesisolated form adipose-derived MSCs contain up to fourfoldhigher levels of enzymatically active neprilysin, an enzymeimportant in degradation of beta-amyloid, as compared tobone marrow-derived MSCs. Del Fattore et al. [99] furthershowed that exosomes from marrow and umbilical cord-derived MSCs inhibited the growth and induced apoptosisof U87MG glioblastoma cells i n vitro whereas those fromadipose-derived MSCs promoted cell growth but had noeffect on U87MG survival. Lastly, Lopez-Verrilli et al. [100]showed that exosomes prepared from different tissue-speciﬁc MSCs have measurably different effects on neurite
outgrowth in primary cortical neurons and dorsal root gan-glia explant cultures.This diversity of experimental results is fascinating andcomplex. While the opportunities for cell-free treatment ofmany diseases seems at hand, have we merely replaced onevariable cell therapy product with an equally variable cellextract from those cells? Moreover, does this mean each labo-ratory will have its own preferred method, or can we arriveat a standardized protocol to be able to assay the identity,predict the exosome contents, potency, and dosing to beassured of the in vivo effects? The exosome or microvesicleapproach does avoid the transfer of cells and their DNA. How-ever, the small payload of such vesicles suggests a productionissue, and one that must be standardized by acceptablemethods.CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONSOnce thought to function in cell replacement for damagedtissue-resident cells, it is now widely established that themore immediate principle mechanism of action of MSCs invivo is paracrine in nature, and that the generation of exo-somes and microvesicles by MSCs is a critical parameter intheir ability to modify the function of host cells and tissues(Fig. 1). Various studies indicate that MSC-derived exosomesexert their effect via horizontal transfer of proteins, mRNAsand regulatory microRNAs. The ability of diseases and trans-formed cells to also affect the function of tissue residentMSCs is of importance, as usurping the MSCs ability to mod-ify the cancer niche likely plays a critical role in survival andexpansion of cancerous cells both in dispersed and solidtumors. Despite the rapid progress made in exosomeresearch to date, a number of important questions remainwith respect to their role in MSC biology. For example, few
studies have explored whether endogenous niche residentMSCs that play a role in hematopoiesis and skeletal homeo-stasis secrete exosomes or microvesicles, and the role theyplay in niche maintenance under normal physiological condi-
MSCs that play a role in hematopoiesis and skeletal homeo-stasis secrete exosomes or microvesicles, and the role theyplay in niche maintenance under normal physiological condi-tions. Whether the essence of the MSC can be captured byits secreted products and used therapeutically is anothercritical question to be addressed. This is of particular impor-tance owing to the fact that the broad therapeutic efﬁcacyof MSCs is predicated on their ability to rapidly respond tothe injury microenvironment, whereas isolated exosomesw o u l dn o tb ea n t i c i p a t e dt od os o .W ec a na l s oe x p e c tthat the very low number of endogenous MSCs, and theconstantly diminishing number of isolatable MSCs found inthe aging individual make the assessment of the role ofendogenous MSC exosomes a challenging question. Butthese problems of understanding cell to cell communicationvia exosomes and microvesicles are some of the most
interesting problems in biology and not only conﬁned toMSCs or stem cells, and helpful answers may come from thebroader biology community.Use of MSC-derived exosomes/microvesicles in humanpatients has several potential advantages. First, their useavoids the transfer of cells which may have mutated or dam-aged DNA. Second, the vesicles are small and circulate readilywhereas MSCs are too large to circulate easily throughcapillaries and many MSCs do not get beyond the ﬁrst passcapillary bed, usually the lungs (although some clearly getthrough). Third, the dose of infused MSCs quickly diminishespost-transplant, and it may be that the delivery of MSC-derived vesicles can achieve a higher “dose” that circulates toa greater extent than the larger cells. The disadvantage ofusing MSC-derived vesicles is that they are static and morecannot be produced in vivo as may be possible when trans-
planting the cell itself. The question then arises as to thepotency of the vesicles and the therapeutic dose. This meansa potency assay must be developed for the vesicles, a taskthat still challenges many labs developing MSC cellular thera-peutics. While it is almost assured MSC-derived exosomes willadvance toward clinical testing, their utility and efﬁcacy willdepend on a number of critical parameters including reducingto practice reproducible methods to manufacture exosomes/microvesicles of deﬁned content, developing methods of stor-age and recovery of these products that maintain vesiclepotency, and evaluating their therapeutic efﬁcacy in well con-trolled, appropriately powered clinical trials that are rationallydesigned based on supporting scientiﬁc and translational data.One may anticipate that by building on knowledge gainedfrom MSC-based clinical trials the development of exosome/microvesicle-based therapies may experience more rapid
advancement.Phinney, Pittenger 855www.StemCells.com VCAlphaMed Press 2017 15494918, 2017, 4, Downloaded from https://stemcellsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/stem.2575 by Cochrane Japan, Wiley Online Library on [26/09/2024].
