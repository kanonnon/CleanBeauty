Progeroid Syndromes and UV-Induced Oxidative DNADamageYork Kamenisch1and Mark Berneburg1Progeroid syndromes are a group of diseases char-acterized by signs of premature aging. These syn-dromes comprise diseases such as Werner syndrome,Bloom syndrome, Rothmund– Thomson syndrome,Hutchinson–Gilford syndrome, Fanconi anemia, andataxia–telangiectasia, as well as xeroderma pigmento-sum, trichothiodystrophy, and Cockayne syndrome.Clinical symptoms of premature aging are skinatrophy with loss of cutaneous elasticity, dysfunctionof cutaneous appendices, degeneration of the centralnervous system and an increased susceptibility formalignant tumors. Genetic defects in the repair ofDNA damage can lead to progeroid syndromes, and itis becoming increasingly evident that direct DNAdamage and indirect damage by highly reactiveoxygen species play central roles in aging. The clinicalsigns of progeroid syndromes and the molecularaspects of UV (ultraviolet radiation)-induced oxidative
stress in aging are discussed.Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings (2009) 14,8–14; doi:10.1038/jidsymp.2009.6PROGEROID SYNDROMESProgeroid syndromes are mostly monogenetic, rare, heredi-tary diseases, characterized by the premature development ofsigns and symptoms ordinarily associated with chronic aging.As most of the progeroid syndromes usually show only alimited number of features of premature aging, they are alsocalled syndromes of segmental progeria. Clinical hallmarks ofthe progeroid syndromes include diabetes mellitus, changesin the volume of adipose tissue, pigmentary changes withhyper- and hypopigmentation of the skin (poikiloderma),regional skin fibrosis, premature hair graying or hair loss,osteoporosis, neurodegenerative symptoms, and tumorstypical of those seen in patients of older age.Most progeroid syndromes include defects in
different DNA repair systems, such as nucleotide excisionrepair (NER), base excision repair (BER), and double strandbreak repair (DSBR). An increasing number of publicationsindicate that the accumulation of DNA damage is animportant mediator of aging (Schumacher et al ., 2008)(Figure 1).In this review, the clinical features of progeroid syndromeswill be discussed briefly, and subsequently the genotoxiceffects of UV radiation will be communicated. Furthermore,as far as it is known, the underlying defects in DNA repairsystems are introduced with a focus on their susceptibility toUV radiation-induced direct and indirect DNA damage inrelation to progeroid syndromes.UV IRRADIATION AND OXIDATIVE STRESSUV radiation is an important DNA stressor for skin cells. UVBand UVC especially cause several types of DNA damage, ofwhich pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and 6-4 photoproducts arethe most prominent (Berneburg and Krutmann, 2000; deGruijl et al ., 2001; Marrot and Meunier, 2008). Mutations
caused by unrepaired DNA damage can be deleterious to anorganism’s life functions, and the accumulation of mutationsduring life is thought to be a cause of aging. The link betweenimpaired DNA repair and progeroid symptoms is under-scored by the fact that patients with impaired NER also showprogeroid symptoms.As the DNA absorption spectrum has its peak in the UVCand UVB range, UVA radiation as a source of DNA damagewas long neglected. Although it was shown that UVA at highdoses would induce pyrimidine dimers (Rochette et al .,2003), UVA primarily induces oxidative DNA lesions. DNAdamage from UVA can be mediated by reactive oxygenspecies, primarily singlet oxygen, leading to the formation oflesions such as tyminglycols, 8oxo-guanosine, and 8oxo-adenosine. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing debate aboutthe contribution of UVA and UVA-induced DNA damage toaging and carcinogenesis.REVIEW

WERNER SYNDROMEAs early as 1904, Werner syndrome (WS) was described byOtto Werner, on the basis of the premature development ofclassical signs of aging (Kudlow et al., 2007). These includescleroderma-like, atrophic skin, a loss of subcutaneous fattissue, ulceration of the skin, cataracts, premature graying,and loss of hair, osteoporosis, atherosclerosis and diabetes(Thweatt and Goldstein, 1993). The cancer risk in WS is alsoelevated (Shibuya et al., 2005). Tumors include hematologi-cal malignancies, as well as sarcomas and carcinomas of thethyroid and other organs. WS patients develop signs ofaccelerated aging after puberty, and they have a typicalappearance, together with thin arms and legs, a thick torso,and a bird-like face. The incidence of this severe, recessive,
autosomal disease is 1 per million individuals. The causativemutations are within the WRN gene on chromosome 8,biochemically leading to truncation, destabilization, and lossof the encoded WRN protein. In WS pathogenesis, twoimportant domains of the WRN gene must be deactivated: acatalytically active 30-50exonuclease and an ATPase-helicase (belonging to the RecQ helicase family). Function-ally, the WRN protein is involved in DNA replication,homology-dependent recombination repair, and telomeremaintenance. Thus, dysfunctional or absent WRN proteinleads to defects in homologous recombination and, further-more, to genomic instability, finally resulting in cell death.The WRN protein is an important mediator in DNA DSBR.DSBR can be divided into two subpathways: non-homo-logous end joining and homologous recombination repair,the latter requiring the presence of an identical templatestrand.Recently, it was shown that WRN protein oligomeres bind
to replication forks and Holliday junctions, which arefunctionally important for homologous recombinationand replication at stalled or broken replication forks(Compton et al ., 2008). Additional functions in non-homo-logous DNA-end joining, which is required not only for DNAdouble-strand repair, but also for base-excision repair, havebeen suspected (Hickson, 2003; Killoran and Keck, 2006).The WRN protein may also play a role in BER, asits interaction with BER proteins has been shown (Almeidaand Sobol, 2007).In WS pathogenesis, error-prone repair processes, geno-mic instability, and cell death caused by a dysfunctional orabsent WRN protein can lead to tissue dysfunction andsenescence, which may contribute to the aging phenotype.Error-prone repair, increased mutation rates, and genomicinstability could contribute to increased susceptibility tocancer, which is also observed in this disease (Multani and
Chang, 2007). However, the mechanistic role of WRN incarcinogenesis is not certain. Up- or downregulation of WRNprotein levels has been found in different cancers. The WRNprotein, which seems to be expressed ubiquitously in normaltissues, seems to be downregulated by epigenetic methylationin some tumors such as colon carcinomas (Agrelo et al .,2006), but upregulation of the WRN protein is also found incancer cells (Futami et al ., 2008). In this context, it isimportant to mention that although WRN levels can vary incancer patients with primarily functional WRN proteins, theincreased cancer incidence in WS patients is most likelybecause of the accumulation of DNA mutations during itspathogenesis.BLOOM SYNDROME AND ROTHMUND–THOMSONSYNDROMEPatients with Bloom syndrome are characterized by shortstature, skin photosensitivity, cafe ´-au-lait macules, high-
pitched voice, narrow face, hypogonadism, and maleinfertility, immunodeficiencies, chronic lung problems, andlearning disabilities.

DNA damage caused by genotoxic events such as reactive oxygen species or UV radiationinduces DNA damage signaling systems, initiating DNA repair and regulating cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis. The genome maintenance system, wh ichincludes DNA damage signaling systems and DNA repair systems, is responsible for correct repair. If repair is erroneous, the fate of the affected cell s can lead toone of three different responses. If the damage is not compatible with life, apoptosis or necrosis is initiated. Otherwise, cells can initiate aging p rocesses,avoiding cell replication; or, if cell replication is maintained, it can lead to precancerous events.www.jidonline.org 9Y Kamenisch and M BerneburgProgeroid Syndromes
for many types of cancer, frequently for non-Hodgkin’slymphoma, leukemia, and skin cancer. Patients withRothmund– Thomson syndrome are of short stature, frequentlyexhibiting skeletal abnormalities, saddle nose, telangiectasia,juvenile cataracts, atrophic skin, hypo- and hyperpigmenta-tion (poikiloderma), and alopecia. They also have an elevatedcancer predisposition, frequently experiencing not onlyosteogenic sarcomas but also squamous- and basal-cellcarcinomas (Holman and Dyer, 2007). The Rothmund–Thom-son syndrome is caused by defects in the RECQ4 helicase,whereas the genetic cause of most of the patients with Bloomsyndrome is impairment of the BLM gene. The tumor-suppressor genes BLM, RECQ4, and WRN belong to thefamily of RecQ helicases, and they harbor a conserveddomain for a 30to 50helicase, which unwinds DNA double
0to 50helicase, which unwinds DNA doublestrands by hydrolyzing ATP. As with the WRN helicase, theRECQ4 and the BLM helicases are necessary to maintaingenome integrity, but they differ in their functions and in theirinteraction partners (Bachrati and Hickson, 2003; Killoranand Keck, 2006). It is interesting that there is an interactionamong the tumor-suppressor proteins, FANCD2, BLM, andATM. Features of cells with defective BLM or RECQ4 genesare abnormal DNA replication and high frequencies ofhomologous recombination events. Functional RecQ heli-cases may be involved in facilitating removal of mutations ortranslesional synthesis during DNA replication.Werner, Rothmund-Thomson, and Bloom syndromesexhibit many distinct progeroid features, but all originate indysfunctional RecQ helicases. Their common feature is anearly-onset cancer predisposition, pointing to the clinicalimportance of these tumor-suppressing helicases.HUTCHINSON–GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME
HUTCHINSON–GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME(PROGERIA INFANTUM)Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is one of themost severe forms of progeria. Patients with HGPS developsigns and symptoms during their first year of life, and theirmean life expectancy is 13 years, with stroke or coronaryfailure as the main causes of death. Like WS, symptoms ofHGPS recapitulate many phenotypic signs of normal aging inan accelerated form. Symptoms of HGPS are diffuse alopecia,nail dystrophy, scleroderma-like skin changes with variedskin hyperpigmentation, loss of subcutaneous fat tissue,atherosclerosis, and rapid loss of joint mobility. There seemsto be no elevated risk for tumor formation, but this could beattributed to the short life expectancy (Kudlow et al., 2007).The genetic cause of this disease lies in mutations withinthe LMNA gene. The gene encodes for A-type nuclear lamins,
such as lamin A and lamin C, which are encoded byalternative splicing of the LMNA gene on chromosome 1.They can multimerize into filaments, and they are the maincomponents of the nuclear lamina. Besides the function ofmaintaining the integrity of the nuclear lamina, they arethought to be involved in processes such as transcription,replication, cell cycle control, and cellular differentiation.Most patients with HGPS have a specific mutation in exon11, leading to alternative splice sites at the 30end of theLMNA mRNA. This leads to truncation at the C terminal endof lamin A, and the resulting protein is called progerin.Progerin disrupts interactions of wild-type A and B lamins orintercepts wild-type lamin A at the nuclear periphery. This
could explain the abnormal nuclear morphology of HGPScells (which is a reliable diagnostic marker for HGPS) and thedominant inheritance of HGPS. It has also been shown inmurine models that an altered processing of Lamin A orexpression of progerin results in a more severe HGPS-likephenotype than does deletion.Although HGPS cells show increased p53 transcriptionafter DNA damage, these cells show delayed recruitment ofDNA repair proteins and sensitivity for DNA double-strandbreaks. It has been shown that expression of defective laminA hinders the formation of DNA repair foci after UV
A hinders the formation of DNA repair foci after UVirradiation or cisplatin treatment (Manju et al ., 2006). Themanner in which progerin interferes with DNA repairprocesses is still not known, but it would be interesting tolook for impaired NER, BER, and DSBR processes andpossible interaction of progerin with NER, BER, or DSBRproteins. It was shown recently that expression of A-typelamins in colorectal cancers increases the risk of deathbecause of increased invasiveness of these tumors (Williset al., 2008).FANCONI ANEMIA
FANCONI ANEMIAPatients with Fanconi anemia (FA) are of short stature, exhibitskeletal and neurological anomalies during infancy, and havean increased cancer risk (lymphoma, esophageal carcinomaand head and neck squamous-cell carcinomas, liver, andbrain tumors), but mental defects and photosensitivity are notobserved (Figure 2). Commonly, FA is characterized byinfantile aplastic anemia, and many patients developmalignancies such as acute myelogenous leukemia (Jacque-mont and Taniguchi, 2007). Defects in several genes maygive rise to FA in an autosomal or X-linked recessive manner.All of the FA genes are involved in a DNA damage-activatedFigure 2 .43-year-old female patient with Fanconi anemia and increasedchromosome instability with Mitomycin C. (a) Telangiectasia on the face and(b) mild poikiloderma with hypo- and hyperpigmentation and three initialsquamous-cell carcinomas in the neck–chest region.

signaling pathway, which is called the FA pathway. Cellsfrom FA patients are hypersensitive to DNA cross-linkingagents such as cisplatin, and they show accelerated telomereshortening, which is because of increased telomere breakage(Grillari et al., 2007). At present, 13 different complementa-tion groups and 12 genes responsible for FA have beenidentified, but little is known about the function of theirrespective gene products. Eight FA proteins form a nuclear-localized complex (FA core complex) with E3 ubiquitin ligaseenzymatic activity. This ligase activity catalyzes monoubi-quitylation at lysine residues in target proteins. This mono-ubiquitylation does not lead to proteasomal degradation, butit can alter cellular localization or functions of the targetproteins. In response to DNA damage (primarily DNA
double-strand breaks) the FA core complex monoubiquity-lates the FA protein, FANCD2, which later co-localizes toDNA damage-associated nuclear foci, together with otherDNA repair proteins. As mentioned above, FA patients showan increased risk for specific cancers, which points to theimportant relationship between the FA pathway in genomemaintenance and carcinogenesis. It is of interest that in manytumors (breast cancer, cervical cancer, non-small cell lungcancer, testicular cancer, and head and neck squamous-cellcarcinomas) from non-FA patients, alterations in the FApathway have also been reported (Olopade and Wei, 2003;Dhillon et al., 2004; Marsit et al., 2004; Narayan et al., 2004;Wang et al., 2006). These cancers could have had their originin cancer predecessor cells, in which a hampered FApathway increased mutation rates.ATAXIA–TELANGIECTASIA
ATAXIA–TELANGIECTASIAAtaxia and telangiectasia (small dilated blood vessels near thesurface of the skin or mucous membranes) are the eponymoussigns of patients with ataxia–telangiectasia (A– T), also knownas Louis–Barr syndrome. A–T patients develop ataxia, withproblems in walking and standing beginning in childhood, sothat most patients are bound to wheelchairs by the age of ten.A– T signs also include hypogonadism, progressive cerebellardegeneration, immunodeficiency, and sensitivity to ionizingradiation. Life expectancy is low because of a high incidenceof malignancies, such as leukemia, as well as immunodefi-ciencies (Cimprich and Cortez, 2008). The genetic origin ofthis disease is a defect in the ATM (Ataxia–TelangiectasiaMutated) gene on chromosome 11. The ATM protein, a serinethreonine kinase, is an important interface between DNAdamage and activation of DNA repair mechanisms (Char-ames and Bapat, 2003). Cells from A–T patients are
hypersensitive to DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), inducedby cisplatin or g-radiation, and it is well known that ATM isinvolved in DSBR (Lee and Paull, 2007). Recently, it wasshown that ATM is also activated by UV or reactive oxygenspecies treatment, leading to activation of p53 and check-point kinases, but direct involvement in NER or BERprocesses had not been suspected (Helt et al ., 2005).However, it was shown recently that ATM can influenceBER through post-translational modifications (Almeida andSobol, 2007). In meiosis, ATM is needed for recombination,and in mitosis ATM is involved in activation of cell cyclecheckpoints in response to DNA damage. The latter functioncan prevent chromosomal abnormalities and chromosomalinstability by stopping cell cycle progress until DNA damageis repaired and thereby synchronize subsequent mitotic steps.XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM
XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUMThe rare autosomal inherited progeroid diseases to bediscussed next all have defects in the NER system. Xerodermapigmentosum (XP) is characterized by extreme sun sensitivity,and all patients are highly susceptible to development ofsunlight-induced cancers of the skin, with an approximate1,000-fold increased risk (Figure 3). XP patients also have anincreased frequency of internal cancers, including centralnervous system cancers, and lung cancers (Berneburg et al.,
nervous system cancers, and lung cancers (Berneburg et al.,2000; Berneburg and Lehmann, 2001; Kraemer et al., 2007;Lim et al ., 2007). Other signs include skin telangiectasia,ocular changes, and mental retardation. The genetic causesof this severe disease are mutations in XP genes (XPA-XPG)(de Laat et al ., 1999; de Boer and Hoeijmakers, 2000),leading to dysfunctional XP proteins. XP proteins are theprincipal actors in the NER system (Maddukuri et al., 2007),which will be outlined below.Nucleotide excision repair is a versatile repair pathwaythat removes bulky helix distorting DNA damage, such asUVC- and UVB-induced CPD and 6-4 photoproducts, as wellas cisplatin. It has also been shown that NER is involved inFigure 3 .22-year-old male patient with xeroderma pigmentosum.Poikiloderma with hypo- and hyperpigmentation, paralleled by telangiectasiaand dry skin in sun-exposed areas.

the removal of oxidative DNA damage. In this complex repairprocess, a several base pair-long DNA single strand, whichharbors the mutation, is excised, and the gap is refilled byDNA polymerase. The NER pathway can be divided into twosubpathways. The fast transcription-coupled repair (TCR)pathway removes DNA damage from actively transcribedgenes, and the global genome repair (GGR) removes DNAdamage from the rest of the genome. For GGR damage,recognition is carried out by the XPC protein in complexwith HR23B, whereas for TCR, damage is recognized bystalled RNA polymerase. Subsequent steps of NER are similarin both TCR and GGR. The XPA protein is necessary fordamage verification and recruitment of further NER factors,XPB and XPD are helicases that unwind the DNA on both
sides of the damaged area. In subsequent steps, XPE and XPFendonucleases excise the DNA single-strand harboring themutation. Finally, after the DNA polymerase refills the gap,and after ligation, the damaged DNA is repaired.Cells of XP patients show defects in NER, affecting TCR orGGR or both. In XP, deficiency in the repair of direct UV-induced DNA damage may explain the photosensitivity andthe increased skin cancer risk. In contrast, Cockaynesyndrome, described below, also includes defective repairof indirect oxidative DNA damage, which may account for itsstronger progeroid phenotype.TRICHOTHIODYSTROPHY
stronger progeroid phenotype.TRICHOTHIODYSTROPHYClinical signs of trichothiodystrophy (TTD) include charac-teristic brittle hair and nails. More severe signs areneurological and skeletal degeneration, marked photosensi-tivity, growth, and mental retardation, as well as ichthyosis.In contrast to XP, patients with TTD do not have an increasedrisk for skin cancer, although the causative mutations canreside in the same gene (Lim et al ., 2007). There are threedifferent complementation groups for TTD. The majority ofpatients harbor mutations in the XPD gene, in which XPD orTTD or XP in combination with Cockayne syndrome (CS) canoccur (Berneburg and Lehmann, 2001; Kraemer et al., 2007).The second group has mutations in the XPB gene. The thirdgroup shows a temperature sensitive instability of thetranscription factor TFIIH.COCKAYNE SYNDROME
COCKAYNE SYNDROMECockayne syndrome is characterized by mental and devel-opmental retardation and photosensitivity. Other signs areprogressive sensorineural hearing loss, short stature, a typicalbird-like face, deep-set eyes, loss of subcutaneous fat, andprogressive neurological degeneration. Patients show signs ofprogressive aging and suffer from progressive neurodegenera-tion, with demyelinization of the brain stem and cerebellum(Berneburg and Lehmann, 2001). There are two complemen-tation groups in CS: CSA and CSB, but specific mutations inthe XPB-, XPD- and XPG-genes can also cause a CSphenotype (Berneburg et al., 2000; Berneburg and Lehmann,2001; Kraemer et al., 2007; Lim et al., 2007). Cells from CSpatients are characterized by impaired TCR. Unlike XP cells,which also can have defects in the TCR subpathway, thecancer incidence in CS patients is not elevated. Thisobservation seems to be counterintuitive, as one wouldexpect that accumulating dysfunctional NER mutations
would increase cancer susceptibility. Although this argumentwould seem to be conclusive, differences between XP and CScould be explained by the additional functions of CSA andCSB proteins. It was shown that CSB also plays a role in basaltranscription, as it can be found in complex with RNApolymerase II. CS cells show generally lower transcriptionrates compared with CS-proficient cells, and it has beenhypothesized that transcription defects could cause theneurodegenerative features of CS (Kraemer et al ., 2007).There is also increasing evidence that CSA and CSB proteinsare involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage, either inthe BER system or in newly recognized repair systems(Frosina, 2008; Stevnsner et al ., 2008). In BER, a single
the BER system or in newly recognized repair systems(Frosina, 2008; Stevnsner et al ., 2008). In BER, a singledamaged nucleotide is removed by specific enzyme com-plexes. The removal of 8oxo-guanosine (8oxoG), in whichthe glycosylase 8-oxoguanosineglycosylase removes thedamaged 8oxoG from its ribose backbone, leaving an abasicsite in the DNA, is well characterized (Sung and Demple,2006). In this repair process, the ribose at the abasic site isremoved, and the missing nucleotide is refilled by a specificpolymerase.BER and NER systems are generally believed to operateseparately, with each system specific for different types ofUV-induced DNA damage. But recent work documents theinvolvement of specific proteins in the NER system duringremoval of oxidative lesions specific for the BER system(Frosina, 2008; Stevnsner et al ., 2008). This is especiallycertain for CSA and CSB proteins, which are involved in theTCR NER subpathway (Dianov et al., 1999; Tuo et al., 2003;
D’Errico et al., 2007; Trapp et al., 2007; Wong et al., 2007). Itwas shown that human fibroblasts of CSA- and CSB-deficientcells are also defective in the repair of 8oxoG and8oxo-adenine (Tuo et al ., 2003; D’Errico et al ., 2007).In addition, Tuo et al . (2003) have shown that depletion ofCSB proteins decreases the rate of BER-dependent repair of8 oxoG, further indicating that BER-specific hOgg (human8-oxoGuanosineglycosylase) and CSB might act as a com-mon protein complex. Furthermore, Wong et al .(2007) showed that BER-associated apurinic/apyrimidinicendonuclease (APE1) interacts with the CSB protein. InOgg1-deficient mice, repair of 8oxoG is impaired (Araiet al ., 2002), as CSB-deficient mice show age-dependentaccumulation of 8oxoG and other oxidative DNA lesions.However, in mice deficient in Ogg1 and CSB, 8oxoGaccumulation is much higher, strengthening the link betweenBER-associated Ogg1 and NER-associated CSB protein. Not
only do TCR-associated NER proteins such as CSA and CSBseem to have additional functions in the repair of oxidativeDNA damage but so also does the GGR-associated NERprotein XPC, as has been shown in the work of Kassam andRainbow (2007).Therefore, as described above, the discovery of new rolesfor the CS proteins in other repair pathways, such as therepair of oxidative stress, may help to differentiate among thepathways that lead to either carcinogenesis on the one handor aging on the other.12 Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings (2009), Volume 14Y Kamenisch and M BerneburgProgeroid Syndromes
CONCLUSIONProgeroid syndromes are a heterogeneous group of diseaseswith overlapping features of accelerated aging. Problems ingenome maintenance caused by impairment in the functionof different genes are responsible for the clinical features ofthese diseases. Owing to mutations in these genes, importantfunctions of genome maintenance, including repair systems,such as DSBR, NER, and BER as well as DNA damagesignaling, are impaired. Cancer predisposition and earlyonset of aging are clinical features of most of the progeroidsyndromes, but the highly increased frequency of skin cancerin the NER-deficient disease, XP, points to the importance ofthis repair system for UV-induced skin cancer. On the otherhand, NER-deficient diseases such as CS and TTD do not
show increased photocarcinogenesis. There is increasingevidence that the different systems of genome maintenanceare linked to each other and that DNA repair proteins playmultifunctional roles in different repair systems. Interplay ofNER systems with other repair systems such as BER isbecoming increasingly important in clarifying the roles ofspecific genes in genome maintenance and the contrastbetween aging and carcinogenesis.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors state no conflict of interest.REFERENCESAgrelo R, Cheng WH, Setien F, Ropero S, Espada J, Fraga MF et al.
