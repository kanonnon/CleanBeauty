Generally, ectosomes and exosomes are two distinct subtypes of EV.3 Ectosomes are vesicles typically 50 nm to 1 µ m in diameter generated by direct budding with plasma membrane; in con -trast, exosomes, ranging in size from 40 to 160 nm, originate from the endosomal compartments, and are ubiquitous in body fluid.4
4 Exosomes are composed of a lipid bilayer membrane and contain all molecular constituents, including DNA, RNA, lipids and proteins.5 Notably, exosomes have distinct abilities to influence many activities through exchanging bioactive components with neighboring cells and transporting genetic contents towards distal cell subpopulations, which likely reflect the molecular and genetic profiles of the parent cells.6 MSC-derived exosomes function as potent therapeutic vehi -cles; they also appear to recapitulate the broad therapeutic effects that have been described in MSC themselves.7 A comparison of MSC and MSC-derived exosomes is presented in Table 1.1.1  | Biogenesis and secretion of exosomesExosome generation involves the inward budding of the plasma membrane and formation of intracellular multivesicular bodies (MVB), followed by further invagination of endosomal membranes, which was dependent on their physiological or pathological status.5

MSC-derived exosomes are involved in intercellular communication through transfer of proteins, RNA, DNA and bioactive lipids, which might constitute a novel intercellular communication mode.

|  3101XUNIAN ANd KALLURIThe uncovered mechanisms for MVB formation as well as exosome release will be briefly summarized.1.1.1  | Sorting complex required for transport machineryThe endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery is critical for the regulation of exosome biogenesis. Four complexes (ESCRT-0, -I, -II and -III) and the associated accessory proteins (ALIX, VPS4 and VTA1) were identified and involved in recognizing the targeting proteins to exosomes and orchestrating a discrete step for MVB vesicle formation.8 All the accessory proteins allow dissociation and recycling of the ESCRT machinery.91.1.2  | Endosomal sorting complex required for transport-independent mechanismsRecent reports also suggest that ESCRT independence is important during exosome biogenesis, including ceramides and tetraspanin proteins (eg CD81, CD82 and CD9), which are responsible for the sorting and loading of various cargoes to exosomes.8 Tetraspanins
8 Tetraspanins are ubiquitous transmembrane proteins enriched in exosomes, which can directly interact with various types of receptors in the plasma membrane, and participate in the formation of the microdomains that bud.10 However, both ESCRT-dependent and ESCRT-independent pathways work synergistically, and different subpopulations of ex -osomes depend on different machineries.1.1.3  | Exosome secretion regulationIt is well known that the RAB family of small GTPase proteins, such as Rab27a, Rab27b, Rab35 and Rab7, has been implicated in trans -ferring vesicles between intracellular compartments, and has also been implicated in intracellular vesicular trafficking to the plasma membrane for exosome release.11 Furthermore, the biogenesis and secretion of exosomes released from MSC also depend on external stimuli. For instance, MSC undergoing hypoxia or inflammation could influence the biomolecule packaging process into exosomes and af -
fect their functional properties, such as the hypoxia-conditioned MSC-derived exosomes exerting more angiogenic activity than nor -moxic exosomes.12 The Wnt and mTOR pathways are considered as “master regulators” involved in the enhancement of self-renewal in MSC by increasing β -catenin expression, and are also required for exosome secretion.13-15 In summary, the process of exosome bio -genesis and secretion is complex but varies depending on cell type and cellular homeostasis, which is also influenced by the surrounding microenvironment. Figure  1 illustrates the intracellular composition, release and uptake of MSC exosomes.1.2 | Contents of mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomesExosome associated plasma membranes are composed of several kinds of lipids, including hexosylceramides, cholesterol, phosphati -dylserine, sphingomyelin and saturated fatty acids.16 Exosomes are
also enriched in various proteins with multiple functions, including the proteins associated with exosome biogenesis (eg ESCRT com -plex, ALIX, TSG101 and syntenin), membrane transporter and fusion proteins (eg Rab GTPases and annexins).17 In addition, an evolu -tionary conserved set of proteins are also packaged into exosomes during biogenesis, including tetraspanins (eg CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD82), integrins, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II proteins and heat shock proteins.4 Exosomes appear to be as di -verse as the original cell types and may serve as a critical determi -nant in their function. Specifically, MSC-derived exosomes not only express the common surface markers like CD81 and CD9 but also express CD73, CD44 and CD90, which are characteristic of MSC.18 Characterization of the contents based on the proteomics of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-derived exosomes identi -

In other words, the abundant specific mRNA in exosomes may partly reveal a special “zip -code” sequence.22 The RNA present in MSC-derived exomes are usu -ally involved in the regulation of cell survival and differentiation but also related to immune system modulation.23 A system view of the
23 A system view of the miRNA of MSC-derived exosomes identified that the top 23 miRNA were capable of angiogenesis promotion, tissue remodeling and cardiomyocyte proliferation.23 Comprehensive information on the complete RNA content between BMSC and adipose-MSC (AMSC)-derived exosomes revealed that both were similar in RNA composi -tion but strikingly different in tRNA species that were associated with the MSC differentiation status.24 The comparison of exosome mRNA from BMSC and the human liver stem cells (HLSC) shows that BMSC-derived exosomes contained a specific number of cellular mRNA, which were related to differentiation into the mesenchymal pheno -type, cell transcription and proliferation regulation.25 However, a specific subset of mRNA found in HLSC-derived exosomes was asso -ciated with the liver cell metabolism and proliferation.26In addition to protein and RNA species, several types of DNA have been detected in exosomes.5,27,28 Previous studies had iden -
tified large fragments of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) ( >10 kb), which indicated that mutations in KRAS  and p53  can be detected using genomic DNA from exosome DNA for pancreatic cancer pre -diction.5 The transfer of exosome DNA into target cells was also reported to exert multiple biological activity in recipient cells tran -siently.29 Tumor-derived exosomes contain immunostimulatory DNA, which could be recognized by cytoplasmic DNA receptors in activated dendritic cells (DC) through the induction of the STING-dependent pathway and drove anti–tumor immunity.29 The hor -izontal DNA gene transfer by exosomes released from BMSC was identified. It carries high-molecular DNA, which was mainly associ -ated with the outer exosome membrane for the exchange of genetic FIGURE 1  Biogenesis, secretion and molecular composition of the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes.

biogenesis, secretion and uptake by recipient cells. First, multiple proteins were internalized from the cell surface or transported from the Golgi; nucleic acids were endocytosed and delivered into the endosomes, followed by the formation of intracellular multivesicular bodies (MVB). Further invagination of late endosomal membranes ultimately results in the secretion of exosomes. MVBs then either taken up by lysosomes for degradation or fused with plasma membrane for releasing all their cagos into extracellular spaces. The secreted exosomes could be taken up by recipient cells through either direct fusion of their membrane or endocytosis. B, MSC-derived exosomes are enriched in various proteins with multiple functions, such as the biogenesis-related proteins (eg ALIX, TSG101), common surface markers (eg CD9, CD81, CD29, CD44 and CD90), membrane transporter and fusion proteins (eg Rab GTPases and annexins), integrins, heat shock proteins (eg HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90) and MHC class I and

Cancer cells are surrounded by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME), which is a highly heterogenous and dy -namic intricate ecosystem that consists of different cell types. The crosstalk of MSC-derived exosomes in TME seems to be pivotal for cancer progression.1.3.1  | Tumor growth
1.3.1  | Tumor growthAccumulating evidence has linked the transfer of tumor-associated miRNA enriched in MSC-derived exosomes with the promotion or inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. The function of BMSC-derived exosomes has been widely investigated. It was shown that the enriched miR-222-3p in exosomes could directly tar -get IRF2 that negatively regulated IRF2/INPP4B signaling, which contributed to the suppression of the tumor growth in acute my -eloid leukemia (AML) cells.31 Exosomes also enable the delivery of miR101-3p and lead to the inhibition of oral cancer progression via targeting COL10A1.32 Along with BMSC-derived exosomes, several groups have also reported that exosomes isolated from human um -bilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSC) possess tumoricidal properties themselves.33 They could inhibit the growth of human lymphoma cells by blocking the cell cycle, induction of superox -
ide dismutase and hydrogen peroxide activity, as well as reduction of glutathione peroxidase.33 Similarly, AMSC-derived exosomes demonstrated a suppressive effect through the delivery of miR-145, leading to the induction of apoptosis via the activation of the caspase-3/7 pathway and reduction of Bcl-xL activity in prostate cancer.34 It also exerted inhibitory effects on human ovarian cancer cells through cell cycle arrest, activation of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis signaling, as well as downregulation of the anti–apoptotic protein BCL-2, which partly resulted from a rich population of sup -pressor miRNA.35 Fonsato et al showed that the transfer of several miRNA (eg miR451, miR223, miR24, miR125b miR31 and miR122) by exosomes into target HepG2 cells could suppress tumor cell pro -liferation and induce apoptosis, which also exerted potential anti–tumor activity in vivo.36Conversely, the role of exosomes in the tumor promoting effect
was also reported. It has been shown that BMSC-derived exosomes exert a tumor promotion effect through the activation of extracellu -lar signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling in gastric cancer.37 It has also been demonstrated that exosomes could facilitate mul -tiple myeloma disease progression through transferring tumor suppressor miR-15a and result in the alteration of cytokines and ad -hesion molecules secretion.38 In addition, the transfer of miR-410 from hUCMSC-derived exosomes promoted lung adenocarcinoma cell growth through direct inhibition of PTEN  expression.39 Sun et al revealed that hUCMSC-derived exosomes exerted a protective role from cell stress and decreased tumor cell apoptosis, indicat -ing a possible protective role from chemotherapy of tumor cells.40
Yang et al also demonstrated that the incubation of hUCMSC with human breast cells promoted the exchange of biological content through exosomes, including matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and ecto-5′-nucleotidase acquisition, which was associated with the increased tumor heterogeneity via the alteration of cellular func -tionalities and TME.411.3.2 | AngiogenesisIt is well documented that exosomes derived from various cell types have the potential to deliver complex information to en -
tionalities and TME.411.3.2 | AngiogenesisIt is well documented that exosomes derived from various cell types have the potential to deliver complex information to en -dothelial cells, which are implicated in the angiogenetic signaling, exerting either a pro–angiogenic or an anti–angiogenic effect.42,43 So far, the limited studies investigating the functions of MSC-derived exosomes on angiogenesis have yielded contradictory results. Considering their pro–angiogenic properties, it was dem -onstrated that BMSC-derived exosomes could enhance the expres -sion of CXCR4 in human gastric carcinoma and colon cancer cells and promote tumor growth.37 Gong et al revealed that exosomes isolated from conditioned medium of BMSC could transfer several miRNA to HUVEC and promote angiogenesis in vivo.42 Activation of Wnt signaling plays a pivotal role in the pro–angiogenic activ -
ity of exosomes isolated from BMSC, which could transport Wnt3a exteriorly to stimulate fibroblast proliferation and enhance angio -genesis.44 AMSC-derived exosomes could significantly promote angiogenesis by transferring miR-125a to endothelial cells through the inhibition of DLL4 expression.45The anti–vascular remodeling ability was also observed in BMSC-derived exosomes by targeting hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 α) and Smad2, which contribute to the inhibition of angiogenesis.43 Lee et al reported that exosomal miR-16 was in -volved in suppression of angiogenesis through downregulation of VEGF and CD31 expression in breast cancer cells.46 It has also been shown that miR-100 from BMSC-derived exosomes can sig -nificantly reduce VEGF expression through the mTOR/HIF-1 α sig-naling axis and inhibition of angiogenesis in breast cancer cells.471.3.3  | MetastasisMetastasis represents progressive outgrowth of tumor cells leav -

3104  |    XUNIAN ANd KALLURImicroenvironment.48 Emerging evidence has suggested the cru -cial role of exosomes in the TME mediating cancer metastasis.49 For instance, the treatment of BMSC-derived exosomes in combi -nation with radiotherapy could systematically increase tumor cell death and decrease metastatic tumor foci, suggesting its poten -tial therapeutic benefit in anti–metastatic therapy.50 Numerous studies have examined the role of MSC-derived exosomes, which encompass various miRNA and are widely implicated in provoking dormant cells as well as stimulating the formation of metastatic tumors.48 It was demonstrated that BMSC-derived exosomes were able to shuttle miR-205 and miR-31 into tumor cells, result -ing in the reduction of metastatic potential via the suppression of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 N pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells.51 The delivery of miR-143 via exosomes could alter the bi -
ological functions of osteosarcoma cells and also reduced their migration ability in vitro.52 However, exosomes also served as a critical mediator to facilitate tumor migration. BMSC-derived ex -osomes could also promote cycling quiescence and early breast cancer dormancy through the transferase of the miR-222/223.53 Exosomes from AMSC were also found to be involved in the pro -motion of breast cancer cell migration and metastasis through the Wnt signaling pathway via the induction of Axin2  and Dkk1  expressions.54 AMSC-derived exosomes favor the invasiveness of P2X-mediated purinergic signaling, leading to more cell prolifera -tion and invasion.551.3.4 | Drug resistanceGrowing evidence suggests that exosomes play divergent roles in the acquisition of therapeutic resistance and regulation of tumor progression. Interestingly, several mechanisms appear to be in -
volved, such as the promotion of active drug sequestration and the reduction of drug concentration, the ability to deliver specific RNA molecules or proteins into target cells, and exerting crosstalk be -tween cancer cells and stromal cells, contributing to the dysregula -tion of relevant signaling pathways.56-58Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes are reported to act as communicators during drug treatment. Transcriptomic profiles further demonstrated that the underlying mechanism was through the enhancement of cell migration and in -duction of relevant gene expression, such as Ccl3/4 , Ccl4 and Cxcr4 .59 In addition, it was found that exosomes were able to promote breast cancer cell metastasis through the transfer of miRNA-23b and to suppress target Marcks  mRNA expression.60 The exosomal transfer of miR-222/223 was involved in the regulation of drug resistance.53 BMSC-derived exosomes also play a vital role in bortezomib resis -
tance in multiple myeloma cells through the activation of the rel -evant signaling pathways.61 The exosomes derived from hUCMSC were able to confer 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) drug resistance in gastric cancer through the induction of multidrug resistance-associated proteins, and were associated with the activation of MAPK and Raf/MEK/ERK kinase signaling in gastric cancer.621.4 | Manipulation of their microenvironmentMesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes recapitulated the thera -peutic effects of MSC via the modulation of both innate and adap -tive immune responses.7 The dichotomic role of exosomes in the regulation of the immune system was largely dependent on their original cells and the functional state of both parental and target cells.6 However, most previous studies have demonstrated that MSC-derived exosomes exhibit an immunosuppressive effect.1.4.1  | Regulation of the immune responseNatural antigen carriers or direct antigen presentation

senters modulating direct and indirect antigen presentation, and stimulating several different components of both adaptive and in -nate immune responses.63 It was reported that exosomes derived from DC, macrophages as well as natural killer (NK) cells, contain or could transfer specific peptides/antigens to DC, leading to the activation of CD4+ T cells.64 The shared tumor antigens served as a novel source of immunorelevant antigens for naïve T priming/B-cell activation, allowing specific human cytotoxic T cell (CTL) and NK cell activation.65Indirect antigen presentation through transfer to antigenic peptides/bioactive moleculesExosomes also served as vehicles for transfer of antigenic peptides or delivery of bioactive molecules, which, in turn, led to the modu -lation of other immune cell subpopulations.66 Mature DC-released
exosomes bear certain adhesion molecules, such as MHC Class II, CD86 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), all of which were involved the enhancement of T-cell stimulation and initiation of innate anti–cancer immunity.67 It was shown that the delivery of cytosolic dsDNA derived from cancer cells was involved in the exosome elicited adaptive and innate immune reactions through the activation of cGAS-STING signaling.29,68 In contrast, exosomes have also been reported to mediate immunosuppressive properties by carrying molecules and facilitating tumor progression. For instance, transforming growth factor (TGF)- β1 from tumor-released exosomes mediated the suppressive activity of T-cells through the promotion of myeloid cell differentiation.69 Exosomes derived from a subset of cancer cell lines carrying PD-L1 were involved in the suppression of T-cell activity, leading to the promotion of tumor growth.70,71Immunosuppression by mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes
Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes possess a broad spec -trum of immunomodulatory capabilities similar to MSC. The immu -nosuppression activities are summarized in Table 2. BMSC-derived exosomes have multiple roles in the modulation of T cells, NK cells, macrophages, DC and B cells. Recently, Krampera’s group examined the inhibitory effects of BMSC-derived exosomes on unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).72 It was demonstrated  13497006, 2020, 9, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cas.14563 by Cochrane Japan, Wiley Online Library on [26/09/2024].

inhibit NK cell proliferation and function, which was through the upregulation of TGF- β mediating downstream TGF/Smad2/3 signal -ing.77 He et al found that the coculture of exosomes from indoleam -ine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) overexpressed in BMSC with DC and T cells could decrease the expression of interferon gamma (IFN γ).78 In addition, an increased number of Treg and decreased CD8 + T cells were also observed, which may have been due to the alteration of miR-540-3p and miR-338-5p levels.78 BMSC-derived exosomes were able to recapitulate MSC-mediated DC maturation and func -tion.79 It was reported that they could induce immature IL-10 secret -ing DC activation, increase Foxp3 + Treg cell numbers and inhibit inflammatory T helper 17 (Th17) cell responses, which appear to be enriched in higher levels of TGF- β, IL-10 and IL-6, but decrease IFN- γ and IL-17 secretion.79 Cristina et al found that exosomes suppressed
79 Cristina et al found that exosomes suppressed monocyte-derived DC differentiation, maturation and T-cell immune response, which relied on expression of HLA-G.80 Exosomes were shown to impair antigen uptake by immature DC and to halt DC activation, which contributed to increased anti–inflammatory cy -tokine TGF- β production and decreased pro–inflammatory cytokine secretion.81 In addition, transfection of DC with exosomes carrying miR-21-5p mimic showed diminished C-C motif chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) expression and significant inhibition of migratory ability toward chemokine CCL21.81 BMSC-derived exosomes are also in -volved in the transition from naïve B cells to CD24hiCD38hi, IL-10-producing Breg cells, but has no influence on their proliferation.82 It was also shown that exosomes exerted an immunomodulatory effect on CpG-stimulated PBMC proliferation via the downregula -

tem. Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling can serve as a regulator of MSC immunomodulation, and TLR activation can modulate MSC to switch from a predominately immunosuppressive to a pro–inflammatory phenotype but are more likely depending on experimental settings.88 Human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived exosomes induced the ac -tivation of TLR-dependent signaling and, in turn, activated more Treg cells, which attenuated an activated immune response.89 AMSC-derived exosomes were reported to suppress stimulated T-cell pro -liferation and activation.90 hUCMSC-derived exosomes preferably bound to the monocytes in PBMC, and gave rise to M2 macrophages with more production of immune suppression-associated cyto -kines.91 Exosomes derived from hUCMSC stimulated with TGF- β and IFN- γ could enhance Treg differentiation.92 In addition, PGE2 was the key mediator responsible for BM-derived mast cell immunosup -pression by significantly decreasing TNF α secretion.93

They have of a bilayer lipid membrane, which is similar to cell membrane and confers lower toxicity when injected in mice repeatedly.6 The MSC-derived exosomes exhibited an innate targeting tendency to prefer the inflamed tissues and tumor tissues upon in vivo delivery, which appears to hold possible benefits for genetic modification to express therapeutic proteins or targeting surface proteins to provide treatment potential.941.5.1  | Exosomes engineering and functional cargo loadingThere is growing extensive literature documenting the application of genetic and nongenetic approaches for the generation of modified exosomes from in vitro modification of MSC.6 To date, the package of nucleic acid, proteins and other active molecules into exosomes has been widely applied.1.5.2 | miRNA and siRNA
It was shown that BMSC-derived exosomes equipped with syn -thetic miR-143 could lead to the suppression of migration in os -teosarcoma cells.52 Mark Katakowski et al engineered MSC to shed exosomes that contain miR-146b, and found that intra-tumor injection of miR-146b through MSC-derived exosomes could sig -nificantly inhibit glioma growth, reduce its invasion, migration via targeting on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling.95 It was reported that BMSC that secrete exosomes encapsulated with miR-379 could significantly reduce the rate of tumor prolifer -ation and survival in breast cancer cells, as well as decrease lymph node metastasis.96 It was shown that the systemic administration of exosomes equipped with anti–miR-222/223 could significantly increase host survival and be more sensitized to carboplatin-based therapy in breast cancer.53 Ohno et al showed that the ac -
of exosomes equipped with anti–miR-222/223 could significantly increase host survival and be more sensitized to carboplatin-based therapy in breast cancer.53 Ohno et al showed that the ac -tive loading of let-7a into exosomes enabled the delivery of let-7a into EGFR-expressing breast cancer cells and exerted significant anti–tumor effects in various breast cancer models.97 In addition, clinical-grade MSC-derived exosomes with KrasG12D siRNA pay -load have been applied for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in vivo, which yielded a robust increase in overall survival and ena -bled specific target engagement without any obvious toxicity.98,99 Similarly, serine/threonine-protein kinase (PLK-1) silencing by siRNA via BMSC-exosomes delivery resulted in the depletion of PLK-1 and contributed to cell cycle arrest and more cell apoptotic cell death in bladder cancer cells.1001.5.3 | Functional proteins
1001.5.3 | Functional proteinsEngineered exosomes also served as an attractive vehicle for the delivery of biologically active proteins. Sterzenbach et al labeled an intracellular target protein Cre recombinase with a WW tag, which was recognized by the L-domain motifs containing protein Nedd4 family interacting protein 1 (Ndfip1); the Ndfip1 expression acts as a molecular switch for exosomal packaging of WW-Cre and a test for intracellular protein delivery in vivo.101 Recently, it was found that TRAIL delivery via MSC-derived exosomes served as an effective anti–cancer therapy that induced pronounced apoptosis in a series of cell lines.102 Furthermore, the combination therapy of exosomes derived from TRAIL-overexpressed MSC with CDK9 inhibitor could significantly increase apoptotic cancer cell death.1021.5.4 | Small molecule therapeuticsExosomal delivery of small therapeutic molecules, including doxo -rubicin, paclitaxel, porphyrin, curcumin, taxol, methotrexate, cispl -
atin and withaferin, has been widely investigated, and some of them have been registered in clinical trials.103-106 Those drugs are slowly released from the exosomes and result in higher drug accumula -tion in target cells and longer blood circulation time and enhanced  13497006, 2020, 9, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cas.14563 by Cochrane Japan, Wiley Online Library on [26/09/2024].

|  3107XUNIAN ANd KALLURItherapeutic efficacy.107 MSC-derived exosomes have been engi -neered as an efficient delivery system reported to exert higher anti–tumor efficacy and reduced toxicity.108,109 For instance, BMSC-derived exosomes encapsulated with doxorubicin are preferentially taken up by human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 + (HER2 +) cells in vitro, leading to an inhibitory effect in a breast tumor model.110 It was observed that paclitaxel-treated BMSC mediated obvious anti–tumor activity because of their capacity to take up the drug inside exosomes, which results in an obvious inhibition of cell growth and proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells.105 Melzer et al reported that exosomes served as cellular carriers for taxol, which were extensively distributed around the breast tumor after their di -rect intratumoral injection and significantly inhibited tumor growth and reduced metastasis.111 In addition, ESC-derived exosomes were
111 In addition, ESC-derived exosomes were highly versatile and could deliver therapeutic porphyrin to target breast cancer cells, thereby leading to the improvement of cellular uptake of porphyrins associated with a strong induction of reactive oxygen species.1061.6 | Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes in clinic trialsCurrently, there are nine studies undergoing clinical trials, and they are listed in www.clinicaltrials.gov.109 A combination of ascites-de -rived exosomes with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) underwent a phase I clinical trial for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, which was shown to be feasible and safe and also capable of triggering more CTL infiltration in tumor regions.112 Another phase I clinical trial using exosome delivery of curcumin to colon tumors and normal colon tissue was started in 2011 and is estimated to end in 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov identi -
fier: NCT01294072). As mentioned previously, siRNA-sxosome-based therapy is being used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer patients with KrasG12D mutation via KrasG12D in a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03608631). Despite these encouraging results for the application of MSC-derived exosomes as a drug vehicle for cancer treatment in clinic, there are still have many challenges ahead. Although a process for production of MSC-derived exosomes with good manufacturing practice grade has been reported, effective large-scale exosome production for clinical ap -plication still needs to be developed.99,113 In addition, there is still a
99,113 In addition, there is still a lack of standard protocols for the characterization of MSC exosomes due to their heterogeneous nature, and this heterogeneity may have diverse effects on the target cells. To ensure therapeutic biosafety, investigating the relationships among delivery route, dosage and pharmacokinetics is also needed. In addition, the horizontal genetic composition transfer via exosomes also raised the potential for dis -crimination risks because of other genetic information exchange between cells.114 Furthermore, it also seems necessary to closely monitor patients who have received MSC-derived exosomes to de -termine the optimal dosage with the best therapeutic efficiency but minimal undesired toxicity individually.2 |  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTION
DIRECTIONCollectively, we discussed the therapeutic potential of MSC-derived exosomes and their exciting new prospects in cancer treatment. With the substantial research being dedicated to MSC-derived exosomes, there will also be more opportunities to manipulate their compo -sition and modulate cell-cell interactions in TME. Despite recent promising advances using MSC-derived exosomes as drug/nucleic acid delivery platforms, it is still necessary to develop appropriate strategies and techniques to tailor exosomes with high drug-carrying capacity, increased target specificity and non–cytotoxic effects. In conclusion, basic research and emerging technologies need to be in -
tegrated to fully exploit the potential of MSC-derived exosomes and to accelerate their therapeutic application in the clinic.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe thank Karina Vazquez-Arreguin and Anthony Chronopoulos for the critical reading of the manuscript.
