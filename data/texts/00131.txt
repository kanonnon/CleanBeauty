momentum. Skin is continuously exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the major causeof skin disorders such as sunburn, photodamage, and nonmelanoma skin cancer. Mostof the erythemal annual UV dose is encountered under nonvacation conditions, whenno sunscreen is applied. In the absence of topically added compounds, skin protectiondepends solely on endogenous defense. Micronutrients can act as UV absorbers, asantioxidants, or can modulate signaling pathways elicited upon UV exposure. UV-induced erythema is a suitable parameter to assess photoprotection. Dietary protectionis provided by carotenoids, tocopherols, ascorbate, ﬂavonoids, or n-3 fatty acids, con-tributing to maintenance resistance as part of lifelong protection.CONTENTSINTRODUCTION ..................................................... 174DAMAGING EFFECTS OF SUNLIGHT .................................. 174Molecular Mechanisms ............................................... 174

Only recently it became clear that, interestingly, the predominant exposureto UV light occurs under everyday circumstances. The average erythemal UV dosein the United States is about 25,000 J/m2per year; 22,000 J/m2for females and28,000 J/m2for males (65, 67). Additional exposure of about 7800 J/m2occurs
with a conservative vacation. Thus, human skin is exposed to a large degree (abouttwo thirds of the cumulative erythemal UV dose/year) inadvertently, when no top-ical protection is used, and especially fair-skinned individuals should be advisedto protect themselves throughout their lives from excess UV radiation (66). Fur-thermore, contrary to previous assumptions, recent analysis of UV exposure datashows that Americans actually get less than 25% of their lifetime UV dose by theage of 18 (66). Three fourths of lifetime exposure is delivered during adulthoodand older age. Photoprotection by endogenous compounds provided from compo-nents in the diet via endogenous delivery to the skin becomes a focus of lifelongmajor interest. Knowledge on systemic photoprotection is in its early stages (108),although pioneering studies stem from about 30 years ago (41, 54, 100). There isevidence from in vitro, animal, and human studies demonstrating actions of di-etary constituents as endogenous
actions of di-etary constituents as endogenous photoprotectants (148). While protection throughindividual dietary components in terms of sun protection factor (SPF) may be con-siderably lower than that achieved using topical sunscreens, an increased lifelongoverall protection via dietary supply may contribute signi ﬁcantly to skin health.
This review addresses the concept of human dietary photoprotection.DAMAGING EFFECTS OF SUNLIGHTMolecular MechanismsUpon light exposure, a cascade of photo-induced chemical and biological reac-tions takes place in the target tissue (39, 64, 121, 124, 169). As a primary event,light interacts with a suitable chromophore. The chromophore may be damaged di-rectly or may act as photosensitizer initiating subsequent chemical reactions. In thepresence of oxygen, secondary reactive oxygen intermediates are generated. Thesereactive oxygen species (ROS) may damage molecules and cellular structures. Thechemical reaction cascade leads to cellular biochemical responses including mod-iﬁed gene expression, impact on kinase-dependent signaling pathways, immuneand in ﬂammatory events, or induction of apoptosis.An example of a direct modi ﬁcation of the chromophore is the formation of
dimeric pyrimidine bases of DNA (124). Exogenous agents (70) and endogenouslyoccurring compounds including porphyrins, ﬂavins, DNA bases, or amino acidsand their derivatives like urocanic acid are considered to act as photosensitizingmolecules (78). According to the postexcitational chemistry of photooxidation,

chemical responses at different levels. UV radiation affects the immune system,and UVB-dependent immune suppression is thought to play a key role in photocar-cinogenesis (11). Apoptotic keratinocytes (sunburn cells) are found in skin afterUVB or high-dose UV A irradiation (33, 94). UV irradiation leads to the release ofceramides from specialized membrane domains known as rafts. Ceramides act assecond messengers and are involved in cellular processes including proliferation,differentiation, senescence, and apoptosis (111). Cellular events and regulatorypathways are also directly triggered by speci ﬁc reactive oxygen species (91, 169,172). Singlet molecular oxygen is a mediator of UV A-induced signaling and af-fects, for example, the expression of heme oxygenase-1, ICAM-1, and matrixmetalloproteinases (MMPs) (26, 73, 138). MMPs play a central role in the pro-cess of skin aging, cleaving collagen and other basement membrane components(169).Skin Diseases
Skin DiseasesSunburn is observed as a common reaction when skin is excessively exposed tosunlight. This injury is called UV-induced erythema, or erythema solare (36).Damage resulting from photochemical reactions leads to the stimulation of in-ﬂammatory pathways. UVB irradiation is considered the major cause of typicalsunburn, which starts to develop within a few hours, culminating about 18 –24hours post irradiation.The individual sensitivity toward erythematogenic UV exposure is character-ized by the minimal erythemal dose (MED), which is de ﬁned as the lowest doseof UV radiation that will produce a detectable erythema 24 hours after exposure(114). MED values differ between individuals and depend on the actual endoge-nous protection by melanin (tanning) and on the skin type (3).Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma are
the major types of skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common andleast dangerous skin cancer, whereas malignant melanoma is comparatively rarebut among the most fatal of all kinds of cancer. There is increasing evidence thatthe incidence of the three main types of skin cancer is linked to sun exposure,individual sun sensitivity, and to some extent to the history of sunburn (5, 45,106). Sunlight and especially the UVB part of the spectrum comprise a completephysical carcinogen (11, 121).As does any other organ, skin ages in a chronological sense with impairedcellular and subcellar functions (169). However, skin may also age prematurely asa result of overexposure to exogenous environmetal factors such as UV radiation.This photoaging process is mainly related to increased exposure to UV A light, butUVB also initiates photoaging (26). Damage to components of the extracellularmatrix such as collagen alters dermal structure. As a consequence, skin loses

Most simple are avoidance of sun exposure and wearing protective clothingas well as topical application of sunscreens, generally recommended during timesof intense exposure, e.g., during holidays or stays at high altitude. It has been specu-lated that an increased topical protection against UV light might affect endogenousvitamin D synthesis in the skin and may cause disorders related to vitamin D de-ﬁciency, e.g., reduced bone strength (81, 107). However, at present the intake of a
vitamin D supplement during use of a sunscreen is discussed controversially (61,107).Human skin is protected against UV radiation by melanins, endogenous pig-ments that scatter and absorb UV light (115). Upon sun exposure, pigmentation isenhanced by stimulated synthesis of melanin in the epidermal melanocytes (sun-tan). The risk for UV-related skin disorders is correlated with pigmentation; thedarker the skin, the lower the risk (176). Application ofL-tyrosine as a key compo-nent of melanin biosynthesis was investigated in animals and humans. However,only minor effects were observed (28). Improved pigmentation was achieved withL-DOPA in animals. Topically applied, synthetic tanning compounds like dihy-droxyacetone do not stimulate melanin production. Increased pigmentation resultsfrom chemical modi ﬁcations of stratum corneum –associated proteins (93, 109).The use of sunscreens for topical protection is promoted as an integral part of
skin cancer prevention programs (107). In most of the sunscreens, UV-absorbingcompounds and inorganic pigments like titanium dioxide or zinc oxide are com-bined. Thus, absorption, re ﬂection, and light scattering are the chemical and phys-ical principles of protection.The effectiveness of sunscreens to protect against UVB is denoted by the SPF,which is determined following standardized methods (75). SPF is calculated as theratio of the MED measured on protected skin over the MED of unprotected skin.In the assay 2 mg of sunscreen are applied per cm2of skin (53, 75). In practicaluse, sunscreens are employed under nonstandardized conditions, and often topicalapplication may be inadequate to obtain optimal protection expected from SPF (9,93, 126).Endogenous Photoprotection
Endogenous PhotoprotectionSystemic photoprotection through endogenous supply of components providesan important contribution to the defense against UV effects. In addition to somedrugs like psoralens or antimalarial agents, dietary constituents have been inves-tigated. Structural requirements for suitable systemic photoprotection depend on

Carotenoids, tocopherols, ﬂavonoids and other polyphenols aswell as vitamin C (for chemical structures see Figure 1) contribute to antioxidantdefense and may also contribute to endogenous photoprotection.The levels of antioxidant vitamins and micronutrients in skin vary with respect
to skin area and skin layer (144, 155, 157) (see Table 1). High levels of carotenoidsare found in skin of the forehead, palm of the hand, and in dorsal skin; lower levelsare found in skin of the arm and the back of the hand. Vitamins E and C are lowerin the dermis than in the epidermis. The stratum corneum contains amounts oftocopherol similar to that in the epidermis with increasing levels at inner layers(158). Polyunsaturated fatty acids and retinoids play a role during in ﬂammatoryreactions and cellular signaling and might thus serve in systemic photoprotection.Mitochondrial mutations of DNA accumulate during aging and can be detectedat elevated levels in prematurely aged skin following chronic exposure to UVlight. In vitro data provide evidence that dietary micronutrients like β-carotene
interact with UV A in the cell and prevent the induction of photoaging-associatedmtDNA mutations (48). UV-induced signal transduction pathways provide targetsfor compounds that activate enzymes (49), and polyphenols have been shown toinhibit UV-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) andAP-1 (110).The concept of endogenous photoprotection implies that the active compound isavailable in suf ﬁcient amounts at the target site (151). Thus, structural features areimportant, and in ﬂuence pharmacokinetic parameters like absorption, distribution,and metabolism, and may affect the level of the compound in skin (160, 175).CAROTENOIDS AND RETINOIDS
CAROTENOIDS AND RETINOIDSCarotenoids as plant pigments function in the protection of the plant against ex-cess light (42). A system of conjugated double bonds comprises the backboneof these molecules, which carry acyclic or cyclic substituents and, in the case ofxanthophylls, contain functional oxygen groups (112). Major carotenoids in thehuman organism are β-carotene, α-carotene, lycopene, phytoene, and phyto ﬂuene,as well as the xanthophylls lutein, zeaxanthin, and α- andβ-cryptoxanthin (89,150). A number of other dietary carotenoids such as violaxanthin or capsorubin arerarely found in human blood, due to poor absorption or direct metabolism (120).The extended system of conjugated double bonds is crucial for the antioxidant

Carotenoids are among the most ef ﬁcientnatural scavengers of singlet molecular oxygen (147). At low oxygen tensioncarotenoids are also able to scavenge peroxyl radicals (32).
Carotenoids are found in the all-trans con ﬁguration in most plants, whereasseveral cis-isomers have been identi ﬁed in human blood and skin. Such cis-isomersexhibit an additional absorption maximum in the UV range, depending on theposition of the cis double bond in the molecule (27). Phytoene and phyto ﬂueneare noncolored carotenoids with only three and ﬁve double bonds in conjugation,respectively, with high UV absorption maxima.Carotenoids are present at the target sites of light-induced damage, the skinand the eye (24, 171). The dermal pattern of carotenoids resembles that of plasma(119, 171), and the absolute levels vary between different skin areas (144).Small amounts of fatty acid esters of lutein, zeaxanthin, 2′,3′-anhydrolutein,α-cryptoxanthin, and β-cryptoxanthin are also found in human skin (171).Carotenoids contribute signi ﬁcantly to normal human skin color, in particular the
appearance of yellowness (1). Noninvasive methods have been developed, usingreﬂectance spectroscopy or Raman spectroscopy to determine carotenoid levels inskin (79, 144). Consuming high amounts of carotenoids may result in discolorationto orange or yellow (carotenodermia) (29, 105).Dietary InterventionIntervention studies on UV-protective effects of carotenoids are presented inTable 2.

Tomato paste contains high amounts of the tomato-speci ﬁc carotenoidlycopene and was selected as a natural dietary source providing carotenoids toprotect against UV-induced erythema in humans (145) (Table 2).

Healthy volunteers re-ceived a supplement providing 180 mg of β-carotene per day over a period of 10weeks. Threshold MED was signi ﬁcantly higher in the group supplemented withβ-carotene. However, no signifcant difference between the supplemented groupand the control was found in the degree of erythema. In a placebo-controlled study,pretreatment with 30 mg of β-carotene per day for 10 weeks diminished the in-
tensity of erythema induced by sunlight (68). A modest protection against UV A-as well as UVB-induced erythema was also observed in a study where increasingdoses of β-carotene (30 –90 mg/d) were applied for 24 weeks; MED at the end ofthe study was 1.5-fold higher than the MED before treatment (96).The ef ﬁcacy of β-carotene in systemic photoprotection depends on the durationof treatment before exposure and on the dose (Table 2). In studies documentingprotection against UV-induced erythema, supplementation with carotenoids lastedfor at least seven weeks, and the dose was at least a total of 12 mg of carotenoidsper day (68, 80, 96, 102, 143). In studies reporting no protective effects the treat-ment period was only three to four weeks (62, 173). No statistically signi ﬁcantchange in the light sensitivity was found when a mixture of antioxidants withabout 5 mg β-carotene per day and some additional lycopene was ingested (74).
However, a decrease in UV-dependent expression of MMP-1 and MMP-9 wasmeasured.Concerns about the safety of β-carotene when applied in high doses raiseda discussion on suitable dose levels for photoprotection (14). In two long-termintervention trials with individuals at high risk for cancer, an increased incidencefor lung cancer of about 20% was found in the groups that received β-carotenesupplements. In these studies, β-carotene was applied for several years at dosesof 20 and 30 mg per day alone or in combination with α-tocopherol or retinol (2,113).In order to lower the dose of β-carotene, it was investigated whether the com-pound can be partially substituted by other carotenoids for sun protection (80).The photoprotective effect of β-carotene (24 mg/d) was compared to that of acarotenoid mixture consisting of β-carotene, lutein, and lycopene (8 mg each/d).
Supplementation was performed for 12 weeks, and carotenoid levels in serum andskin, as well as erythema intensity after irradiation with a solar light simulatorwere determined at baseline and after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. The intensityof erythema 24 hours after irradiation was diminished to a similar extent in bothgroups receiving carotenoid. Hence, supplementation for 12 weeks with 24 mgof a carotenoid mixture supplying 8 mg each of β-carotene, lutein, and lycopeneameliorates UV-induced erythema in humans (80).

Uponsupplementation with a mixture of both carotenoids, epidermal hyperproliferationand in ﬂammatory response following UVB irradiation were diminished. Using anantioxidant mixture providing 6 mg of β-carotene and 6 mg of lycopene per day(with an additional 10 mg RRR- α-tocopherol and 75 µg selenium), protectionagainst UV-induced skin damage was achieved in humans (34). Intervention fora period of seven weeks resulted in elevation of the actinic erythema thresholdand diminished UV-induced erythema. Additionally, pigmentation was increased,lipid peroxidation diminished and the number of sunburn cells were found to belower.Skin Cancer
Skin CancerIn animal studies, carotenoids proved to be useful agents to prevent skin can-cer, and the incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancers was inversely related to β-carotene serum levels (95). However, at present there is no clear evidence fromepidemiological or interventional studies that β-carotene or other carotenoids con-tribute to the prevention of any type of skin cancer in humans (4, 7). In two in-tervention trials with β-carotene at 50 or 30 mg/d, no signi ﬁcant effect on theincidence for nonmelanoma skin cancers was found (71, 72). Also, no effect ofβ-carotene (30 mg/d) on the incidence of solar keratosis was observed in a random-ized controlled study with more than 1600 participants (37). However, protectionwas associated with the use of sunscreen with or without additional β-carotenesupplement.Erythropoietic Protoporphyriaβ-Carotene and, to a lesser extent, lycopene and other antioxidants are successfully
applied to ameliorate secondary effects of erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP)(101). High levels of porphyrins trigger photooxidative reactions leading to skindamage. Upon light exposure, the patients experience a burning sensation followedby erythema formation. Singlet molecular oxygen and electronically excited tripletstates of suitable sensitizers are involved in the pathogenesis of EPP. Some patientsrespond positively to treatment with high doses of carotenoids (up to 180 mg β-carotene/d for several months); the symptoms following photosensitization areameliorated (57, 164).RetinoidsRetinoids, retinoic acid or natural and synthetic derivatives, are widely applied inthe treatment of skin disorders including acne, psoriasis, ichthyosis, and kerato-dermatosis (25). Clinical trials using retinoids in the treatment of skin cancers ledto con ﬂicting results (82). Although retinoic acid triggers pathways of cell growth
and differentiation, its use as a preventive agent is limited due to toxicological

The major retinoid present in human blood and tissues is retinol(vitamin A) and its fatty acid esters. In a small case-control study, the level of serumretinol was found to be inversely correlated with the occurrence of nonmelanomaskin cancer (95).Vitamin A absorbs in the UVB range, but may be a direct target of both UVBand UV A, and it participates in an adaptive response to UV exposure. The physio-logical role of this adaptive response to acute and chronic sun exposure is not yetunderstood (137).TOCOPHEROL AND ASCORBATE
TOCOPHEROL AND ASCORBATEVitamin E (a term comprising several tocopherols and tocotrienols) and vitaminC are present in human skin (116). Protection against UV-induced damage isthought to be due to their antioxidant properties; in particular, the interaction be-tween tocopherol and ascorbate is important in protection against photooxidativedamage (Table 2). Lipophilic tocopherols and the hydrophilic ascorbate scavengereactive intermediates in cellular compartments of different lipophilicity (142).In vitro studies suggest that vitamin C regenerates tocopherol from the toco-pheroxyl radical and transfers the radical load to the aqueous compartment whereit isﬁnally eliminated by antioxidant enzymes (168).In a study on the cooperative activity of both vitamins against UV-inducederythema over a period of 50 days, four treatment groups were investigated: RRR-α-tocopherol (2 g/d) and ascorbate (3 g/d) as single components, a combination
ofα-tocopherol and ascorbate (2 and 3 g/d, respectively), and controls withouttreatment (59). Upon treatment with the combination the sunburn threshold wassigni ﬁcantly increased; MED was about 100 mJ/cm2before and about 180 mJ/m2after supplementation. The single compounds provided moderate but statisticallynot signi ﬁcant protection.Short-time intervention with high doses of both vitamin E and C also affordssome protection. When vitamins were ingested at doses of 1000 IU D- α-tocopheroltogether wit h 2 g ascorbic acid/d over a period of eight days, there was a minorincrease in MED (46). RRR- α-tocopherol has also been tested in combination withcarotenoids as an oral sun protectant. Coapplication of vitamin E and β-carotenetended to be superior to β-carotene treatment alone, but the difference was statis-tically not signi ﬁcant (143). Vitamin E alone, in the form of α-tocopheryl acetate,
was administered orally at 400 IU/d over a period of six months, but no signif-icant protection was achieved (170). Parameters determining the bioavailabilityof tocopherol in human skin are not yet known. MED is not correlated with theepidermal content of vitamin E (60). In addition to the supply via epidermal bloodvessels, alpha- and gamma-tocopherol are continuously secreted with the humansebum (159). Thus, vitamin E is also a constituent of the antioxidant network ofthestratum corneum , the ﬁrst line of defense against exogenous oxidants such asozone (156, 157).

Supple-mentation had no effect on MED.Human and animal studies have shown that vitamin E, and to a lesser extentvitamin C, provide UV protection when applied topically (44, 97). Various end-points indicating phototoxic damage, such as UV-dependent erythema, formationof sunburn cells, skin wrinkling, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage, can bemodulated (58, 104, 155). Using a combination of the vitamins is more ef ﬁcientthan the use of single compounds as ingredients of a topically applicable sunscreen(52, 97).POLYPHENOLS
POLYPHENOLSPhenolic compounds as secondary plant metabolites are major constituents ofthe diet, comprising a large variety of structurally different molecules such as cin-namic acids, benzoic acids, proanthocyanidins, stilbenes, coumarins, or ﬂavonoids(135). Polyphenols are ef ﬁcient antioxidants in vitro, and the antioxidant activityof a number of regularly consumed fruits and vegetables can be attributed largelyto their phenolic constituents (122, 131). Considerable amounts of polyphenols arealso found in cocoa, tea, and red wine (63, 77). The antioxidant properties are dueto the presence of hydroxyl groups, and structure-activity relationships have beenelaborated (130, 136). Due to their amphiphilic properties, polyphenols may serveas lipophilic or hydrophilic scavengers operative in different compartments (139).Beyond antioxidant activity, polyphenols (especially ﬂavonoids and iso ﬂavones)
exhibit other biochemical properties, acting as enzyme inhibitors or enzyme in-ducers in ﬂuencing anti-in ﬂammatory pathways and affecting cell division.Flavonoid consumption with the diet has been associated with lowered risks forcardiovascular disease and cancer. However, human studies on the importance ofﬂavonoids in health have been inconclusive (133, 135, 163).In plants, ﬂavonoids are present as glycosides and are cleaved before absorptionin the human gastrointestinal tract. Data on metabolism of ﬂavonoids indicate apronounced ﬁrst-pass effect, which means that they are ef ﬁciently conjugatedby phase II enzymes yielding glucuronide and sulfate conjugates (151). Thus,bioavailability of free ﬂavonoids with functional hydroxyl groups is thought tobe low. However, human feeding studies provide evidence that absorption andbioavailability of speci ﬁcﬂavonoids is higher than anticipated (135).The so-called green tea polyphenols gained attention as protective agents against
UV-induced damage. The most prominent phenolic compounds in green tea are theﬂavanols ( −)-epigallocatechin, ( −)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, ( −)-epicatechin,(−)-epicatechin gallate, ( +)-gallocatechin, and ( +)-catechin. Animal studies pro-vide evidence that tea polyphenols, when applied orally or topically, ameliorateadverse skin reactions following UV exposure, including skin damage, erythema,and lipid peroxidation (90).

Activation of AP-1 is an important step in tumor promotion, so thatthis inhibitory effect of green tea polyphenols could be a mechanism of protection.In hairless mice (SKH-1), feeding of green tea polyphenols signi ﬁcantly loweredthe yield of UVB-induced skin tumors (167). In a similar model, topical applicationof green tea polyphenols or its major constituent ( −)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate
lowered UVB-dependent oxidation of lipids and proteins, depletion of antioxidantenzymes, and phosphorylation of proteins of the MAPK family such as ERK1/2,JNK, and p38 (162).Topical application of green tea polyphenols to human skin inhibited the UVB-induced erythema response and decreased the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidinedimers in skin, found both in epidermis and dermis (88). In order to identify activecomponents, the skin of healthy volunteers was treated with either an extractof green tea or one of its constituents (50). ( −)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate and(−)-epicatechin-3-gallate polyphenolic fractions were most ef ﬁcient in inhibitingerythema. Skin treated with green tea extracts showed a lower number of sunburncells; treatment protected epidermal dendritic cells from UV damage. Green teaextracts also lowered the DNA damage formed after UV radiation.Topical application of ( −)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate at about 1 mg/cm2was
2wasfound to protect human skin against UV-induced oxidative stress (86). Pretreat-ment with the polyphenol prior to exposure to four times the MED led to a decreasein the formation of hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide, and inhibited lipid per-oxidation and UV-induced in ﬁltration of in ﬂammatory leukocytes into the skin.Taken together, polyphenolic extracts of green tea and their major constituents canprovide some dietary contribution to photoprotection. Topical epigallocatechin-3-gallate was tested for the prevention of nonmelanoma skin cancer in a randomized,double blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial (98). A total of 51 subjectswith actinic keratosis, a readily identi ﬁable precursor of nonmelanoma skin cancer,were treated for 12 weeks; no signi ﬁcant effects were found.Other polyphenols and ﬂavonoids have been investigated in vitro and in ani-
mal models for photoprotection. In a mouse model, topically applied silymarinprovided prevention against UV-induced skin tumors (87). Additionally, silymarinlowered UVB-caused sunburn and apoptosis, skin edema, depletion of catalaseactivity, and induction of cyclooxygenase and ornithine decarboxylase activitiesas well as ornithine decarboxylase mRNA expression (87). Similar effects werereported for the ﬂavonoid apigenin (15).SELENIUMThe trace element selenium plays a major role in antioxidant defense (92).

There is evidence from ani-mal studies that topical application of selenomethione provides some protectionagainst UV-induced skin cancer (30, 31). In an in vitro study (123), the seleno-protein pro ﬁle of cultured human skin cells was examined. Labeling studies using[75Se] selenite showed qualitative and quantitative differences in selenoproteinexpression by human ﬁbroblasts, keratinocytes, and melanocytes. This was most
noticeable for thioredoxin reductase (60 kDa) and phospholipid hydroperoxideglutathione peroxidase (21 kDa). A 24-hour preincubation with sodium selenite orselenomethionine protected both cultured human keratinocytes and melanocytesfrom UVB-induced cell death. With primary keratinocytes, the greatest protectionfrom cell death was found with 10 nM sodium selenite and with 50 nM selenome-thionine. Protection was obtained with concentrations as low as 1 nM with sodiumselenite and 10 nM with selenomethionine. When selenium was added after UVBradiation, little protection was achieved. In all experiments sodium selenite wasmore potent than selenomethionine.In an interesting twist in selenium research, a candidate selenoprotein homol-
ogous to glutathione peroxidase was deduced from the sequence of molluscumcontagiosum, a poxvirus that causes persistent skin neoplasms in children and inAIDS patients (141). Selenium was incorporated into this protein during biosyn-thesis. The selenoprotein protected human keratinocytes against cytotoxic effectsof UV irradiation and hydrogen peroxide, providing a mechanism for a virus todefend itself against environmental stress.However, no skin protection by selenium was observed in a human interventionstudy. In a randomized controlled trial, selenium supplementation did not protectagainst development of basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (35).LIPIDS: LOW-FAT DIET, OMEGA-3-FATTY ACIDS
Based on a series of animal experiments it has been suggested that high fat in-take may increase the sensitivity of skin toward UV-induced carcinogenesis. Ina mouse model, high levels of dietary fat led to enhanced photocarcinogenesis(18). Consequently, a low-fat diet may contribute to the prevention of UV-inducedskin cancer. In a two-year clinical trial, patients suffering from nonmelanoma skincancers (NMSCs) were assigned either to a group receiving a low-fat diet (caloricintake from fat limited to 20%) or a control group (16, 17). The cumulative numberof newly developed actinic keratosis (as a premalignant skin lesion) was comparedbetween groups. In the control group the number of new actinic keratoses per pa-tient was about three- to fourfold higher than in the dietary intervention group,indicating a preventive effect of a low-fat diet on the incidence of actinic keratosis.As to the number of new NMSCs within eight-month periods during the two yearsof intervention, the control

As a general advice derived from thesestudies, it is suggested to lower the intake of calories from fat and increase theconsumption of grains, fruits, and vegetables in order to prevent actinic keratosisand NMSC (83).The correlation between dietary habit and basal cell carcinoma of the skin was
investigated in a prospective cohort of men (161). In 1986, diet was assessed bya food-frequency questionnaire in 43,217 male participants of the Health Profes-sionals Follow-up Study. During eight years of follow-up, 3190 cases with basalcell carcinoma (BCC) were newly diagnosed. Evaluation of dietary intake did notsupport the idea that a lower intake of fat is associated with a diminished riskfor BCC. However, a higher intake of monounsaturated fatty acids was associatedwith a slight decrease in cancer risk. The correlation between dietary factors andthe incidence of BCC was also investigated in a nested case-control study drawnfrom the EPIC-Norfolk cohort (40). Based on the evaluation of 109 cases, no as-sociation between the intake of dietary fat and the incidence of BCC was found.The number of cases was too low to evaluate the risk for squamous cell carcinoma(SCC). Among ten other components of the diet including protein, carbohydrate,carotenoids, and vitamins A, C, D, and E, a
and vitamins A, C, D, and E, a substantial protective effect was onlyfound for vitamin E. The problem of high fat intake, dietary intervention withlipid restriction, and the risk for NMSC is apparently more complex and mightinvolve the action of lipid antioxidants and the composition of dietary fat. Differentclasses of dietary fatty acids have an impact on carcinogenesis. In a case-controlstudy on fat consumption and the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin,the association between dietary n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake and cancer risk wasinvestigated (76). There was a consistent tendency for a lower risk of SCC withhigher intakes of n-3 fatty acids. An increased intake of diets with a high ratioof n-3 to n-6 fatty acids was also associated with a tendency toward a decreasedrisk of SCC. N-3 and n-6 fatty acids differently affect skin tumor formation (20).Hairless mice received isocaloric diets either rich in n-6 or n-3 fatty acids andwere irradiated with UV light to induce
acids andwere irradiated with UV light to induce photocarcinogenesis. Analysis of tumorincidence and tumor multiplicity provided evidence that a diet rich in n-6 fattyacids signi ﬁcantly enhanced carcinogenesis, whereas an n-3 fatty acid source was
protective.In a study with 42 healthy human volunteers, the effects of eicosapentaenoicacid (n-3) or oleic acid on skin responses and early genotoxic markers after UVradiation were investigated (129). Four g of fatty acids were ingested daily for threemonths. In the group supplemented with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), UV-inducedp53 expression in skin and DNA strand breaks in peripheral blood lymphocyteswere lowered, indicating protection by dietary EPA against acute UV-dependentgenotoxicity. As the most prominent result, sunburn sensitivity was diminishedby ingestion of eicosapentaenoic acid. In comparison to baseline, the UV-inducederythemal threshold was increased about 1.4-fold at the end of the study. None ofthese parameters was signi ﬁcantly changed in the group that received oleic acid.These results con ﬁrm earlier studies on the protective effects of dietary ﬁsh oil

After six months of supplementation with about1 0go f ﬁsh oil per day, the MED was increased about 2.1-fold. Photoprotectiveeffects of ﬁsh oil were also determined in light-sensitive patients with polymorphiclight eruption accompanied by diminished basal and UVB-dependent PGE2levels(127). Prostaglandin E 2and nitric oxide in combination play a role in UVB-inducederythema formation (125). Thus, the amelioration of the UV-induced in ﬂammatoryresponse may be due to lowered prostaglandin E 2levels (84).CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOKNutritional contribution to systemic photoprotection is emerging as a topic ofinterest in public health and preventive medicine. Based on in vitro experimentsin cell culture and on various types of animal studies, in vivo studies on healthyvolunteers provided the proof of principle, using a suitable biomarker, erythemaformation. The dietary components, carotenoids [notably β-carotene, lutein orlycopene (108)] are those that plants and other organisms use for their protectionagainst excess light (42).The concept of endogenous skin protection is to provide a maintenance levelat sensitive dermal target sites, beyond those reached by topical, and temporary,coverage through the use of sunscreen. While endogenous protection in terms ofsun protection factor may be low or even marginal, the cumulative effect receivesincreasing attention. Lifelong inadvertent sunlight exposure is important (66).WHAT ARE THE STRATEGIES? Depending on the chemical structure and physico-
chemical properties, micronutrients may directly absorb or scatter light and thuscontribute to UV defense. The obvious strategy for a dietary antioxidant deliveredto the target site is the direct interception of reactive species, as is perceived in thecase of carotenoids and other direct antioxidants such as tocopherols and ascor-bate. These compounds have also been identi ﬁed analytically to be present as suchwithin dermal cell layers. However, at present it is not known whether indeed theobserved action is due to a direct antioxidant function of these micronutrients. Agrowing body of evidence demonstrates that these compounds can serve impor-tant functions independent of direct antioxidant chemistry, by modulating enzymeactivity and gene expression. Changing levels of protein kinase C or of DNA re-pair enzymes, for example, could impact resistance to photooxidative stress. Thus,modi ﬁcation of signaling cascades by nutrients is a developing area of research
(52). Consequently, it may not be a prerequisite for a systemically photoprotectiveagent to be present at or near a sensitive target site. Remote control through genomicand proteomic reset patterns is a further strategy. Examples in this sense are notyet available at the level of the human, but the improvement of cell-to-cell commu-nication by carotenoids could well be a suitable candidate area of research.

There is evidence that not the parent carotenoids but metabolites oroxidation products such as retinoids or apocarotenals are the ultimate active agents(6, 13, 152, 154). Various connexins are found in skin and are of importance fornormal development and differentiation of human epidermis (132).Other strategies may rely on the speci ﬁc biochemistry and physiology of skin.For example, the content of nitrite in sweat, covering skin, could provide bene ﬁt,
because there is generation of NO from nitrite under UV A radiation (153). NOis a signaling molecule involved in UVB-induced melanogenesis (134). However,to date it is unknown whether nutrition may in ﬂuence the availability of the NOsynthase substrate,L-arginine, in the skin or nitrate levels in sweat.Another approach is focused on alternative pathways of transport. Protectiveagents may be delivered via sebaceous gland secretion, as has been shown for thedelivery of vitamin E to upper layers of facial skin (159).WHAT ARE THE MOLECULES? The above-mentioned molecules occur as dietarymicronutrients (Figure 1), and they are detected in skin. However, skin as ametabolically active organ is capable of modifying compounds by various routesof metabolism, and it is possible that the compounds reaching skin are alreadymetabolized, predominantly by so-called Phase II reactions. This may apply toﬂavonoids and polyphenols, an important class of compounds shown to act topi-
cally in terms of photoprotection (108), but there is no analytical proof to date forthe existence of polyphenols in skin.It is quite likely that, as in other organs, a network of active compounds is ofprime importance. Thus, building blocks for antioxidant defense enzymes, includ-ing trace metals such as copper, zinc, cysteine, and selenocysteine, are included inthe scope of this topic.WHAT ARE THE PROCESSES ADDRESSED, AND WHAT ARE THE MOLECULAR BIOMAR-KERS? Sunburn is one phenomenon related to exposure to UV radiation. Ery-thema formation can be readily quanti ﬁed and is being used successfully as a
noninvasive parameter for the assessment of the biological response to UV ex-posure. Whether erythema formation is the most suitable surrogate endpoint forlong-term degenerative diseases such as skin cancer (of the various types), pho-todermatoses, or photoaging needs to be scrutinized in further work. Protectionagainst UV-induced erythema, or sunburn, does not necessarily mean protectionagainst skin cancer. Other biomarkers suitable in relation to skin cancer may bemodi ﬁed DNA bases (124). Increasing numbers of sunburn cells have been takenas a measure for UV-induced damage indicating apoptotic responses (33).WHAT ARE THE RISKS? Lipophilic micronutrients are embedded at low levels inlipid phases, e.g., cellular membranes, or lipoproteins. There is heterogeneity ofmembrane domains, and it is obvious (but not yet analytically proven) that thereshould be local areas of high and low concentration. The mechanisms that lead

Clearly, there are large disparities between skin areasin terms of embedded micronutrient, as shown for instance in the high levels ofβ-carotene in the palm of the hand as compared to other skin areas (144). Couldthere be a risk with levels too high? To date, there are no studies related to skinregarding any of the micronutrients addressed. The use of vitamins E and C hasbeen examined at the level of the intact organism, and recommended daily intakeas well as upper levels of intake have been identi ﬁed (43, 55). As for carotenoids,
there are no recommendations yet, and concern was raised that they are prooxidant(99, 117). Such prooxidant activities may lead to formation of oxidation productsthat are not generated at physiological levels of micronutrients. The increasedrisk for lung cancer under supplementation with high amounts of β-carotene to
a population at risk was ascribed to the generation of oxidative metabolites withimpact on retinoic acid signaling (14, 165, 166). Apparently, there are optimumlevels of micronutrients for antioxidant defense, as illustrated in Figure 2. Withincreasing levels of different carotenoids in cell culture, an increased antioxidanteffect was determined (47). However, further increases of carotenoids lead to a riseof malondialdehyde indicative of prooxidant activity. Thus, optimum levels haveto be achieved for optimal function at the target site. As already noted, antioxidantsinteract synergistically. One of the major tasks in micronutrient research will bethe development of tools that allow estimation of optimum levels.BEYOND PHOTOPROTECTION Micronutrients are of additional bene ﬁt for skin,inﬂuencing moisture and texture as well as elasticity and structure (22, 23). Forexample, ascorbate is essential as a cofactor in collagen biosynthesis.
Claims on cosmetic effects of micronutrients have been made, and an array ofnatural compounds is used in topically applied cosmetic products. However, theﬁeld of cosmeceuticals is only in its developing stages (51). Providing endogenousnutrients for optimum skin health and care is an interesting new aspect. Sucha concept, unfortunately, lacks suitable data from nutrition research in order toprovide a mechanistic base. Appropriate biokinetic, biochemical, and histologicaldata are required before such an approach can be considered sound. Because thewider public is concerned here, caution is to be recommended at this stage. Thisapplies also to the efforts to develop food items enriched with micronutrients(functional food).DIETARY VERSUS TOPICAL? It is important to note that the nutritional aspect fo-
cused on in this review is complementary to topical photoprotection, and thesetwo concepts of prevention should certainly not be considered mutually exclu-sive. One major aspect regarding dietary photoprotection is the time frame: Asnoted in all studies so far carried out, there is a time of approximately eight to tenweeks until protection against erythema formation becomes signi ﬁcant (Table 2).Skin turnover and skin biochemistry therefore require this time frame, whereasprotection by topical sunscreen is practically instantaneous.
