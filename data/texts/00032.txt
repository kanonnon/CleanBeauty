v    Sample Preparation Methods and Protein Techniques for Proteomic Proﬁ  ling  This volume is a comprehensive continuation and extension of a book called “2D PAGE: Sample Preparation and Fractionation” which was published in 2008.  This book presents the latest developments of the main pillars of protein analysis, namely sample preparation, separation, and characterization. Individual technologies of each pillar combined into complementary and robust workﬂ  ows render proteomic analysis of complex biological samples even more powerful and are the prerequisite to gain maxi mum value from biological samples in a single experiment.  In this volume, basic but important sample preparation protocols are described again, followed by sophisticated procedures to enrich for speciﬁ  c protein classes and completed by the detailed description of integrated workﬂ  ows for comprehensive protein analysis and
characterization. The authors of the individual chapters are well-known protein biochem-ists, and all of them have set value to provide a detailed representation of their lab work and to share important tips and tricks for a successful and reproducible employment of their precious protocols in other laboratories.  This book is for students of Biochemistry, Biomedicine, Biology, and Genomics and will be an invaluable source for the experienced, practicing scientist, too.

These mechanical methods of lysing do not introduce chemicals or enzymes to the system. However, the energies needed when using these “harsh” methods can be high and destroy the very proteins being sought.  The destruction of cell membranes and walls by these “harsh” methods is effected by subjecting the cells (1) to shearing by liquid ﬂ  ow, (2) to exploding by pressure differences between inside and outside of
cell, (3) to collision forces by impact of beads or paddles, or (4) a combination of these forces.

lysing. The destruction of cell membranes and walls by these “harsh” methods is effected by subjecting the cells (1) to shearing by liquid ﬂ  ow, (2) to exploding by pressure differences between inside and outside of cell, (3) to collision forces by impact of beads or paddles, or (4) a combination of these forces.  Generally speaking, any of the techniques described here can, to some degree, disrupt any cells or tissues. For more difﬁ  cult materials, just the increase of motivation force or time of exposure will improve breakage. However, the use of excessive force is
2 limited due to the generation of detrimental heat and/or shear that can ruin the desired proteins. In addition, excess force will accelerate wear and ultimately damage the equipment.  By judicious use of the equipment one can select from a gentle nicking of the cell to release intact organelle up to a vigorous action to release membrane bound proteins. Some methods are suitable to handle tissues only, others for free cells only, and some are suit able for both. Some techniques are capable of processing only small quantities of material while others are limited to handling larger amounts.  Tissues that are difﬁ  cult to break down include heart muscle, lung, intestine, and skin. On the other hand, some fragile mam malian cells can be broken by just a moderate shaking of the suspended cells. Free cells that are difﬁ  cult to process include those that are extremely small size (below 0.25 μm) bacteria, and the tough
yeasts and spores. Plant materials and seeds will need higher energy inputs for proper maceration.

3mechanical methods with at least one example of commercial equipment and related websites while Table  2  describes suitable subjects and capacity for each method.2        Bead Impact Methods: Shaking Vessel   All bead devices open the cells or homogenize tissues by throwing the beads (also called “grinding media”) against the cells/tissue. Also the accelerated beads generate strong shear in the liquid buf-fer surrounding the cells/tissues, which also pulls then apart. Two methods to accelerate the grinding media (beads) are (1) by shak-ing the entire container or (2) by a spinning agitator within a container (see next section). The shaking container method is usable for tissues as well as free cells. For extremely small samples of 0.2 mL to somewhat larger quantities of 50 mL, the shaking of the vessel is the method of choice. The motion can be of differing geometries depending upon what equipment is selected. Shaking
can only be done in batch operation thus limiting the amount of 2.1  Theory   Table 2    Suitable subjects and capacity for each method    Type of biomaterial to be lysed →  Bacteria  Yeast, Algae, Fungus, Spores  Seeds  Plants  Tissues  Capacity  Technique ↓  Bead impact – shaking vessel  Y  Y  Y  Y  Y  S/M  Bead impact – agitator shaft  Y  Y  ?

4materials than can be processed. The equipment is very low cost, durable, and simple to operate requiring minimal training.  Materials needed to operate any of these shaking include the cells/tissue, grinding media (beads), liquid phase such as buffer, the container, and the equipment. Variables include the bead selection (density, diameter, and quantity), speed of agitation, cell concentration, and duration of run (Figs.  1  and  2 ).     ●     Denaturing of proteins due to high temperature or excessive shear is to be considered in all mechanical disruption/homog-enization equipments. Also, the wear of the grinding media and container into the samples needs to be evaluated.   ●  Hints for successful temperature control include: (1) Pre- chilling of samples and containers; (2) Runs of short duration 2.2  Practical Aspects  Fig. 1    Bead impact—shaken vessel—Mini Bead Beater-1 equipment         Fig. 2    Bead impact—shaken vessel—inside view—beads moving in jar

5with rest time to allow for re-chilling samples on ice; (3) Use of fewer beads and/or extra buffer to act a heat sink; (4) Reduced degree of shaking vigor.   ●  Detrimental contamination of the batch due to the wear of either the grinding media or container walls is usually rare due to the insigniﬁ  cant amounts involved. A hint to mitigate any contamination problem is to use inert materials of construc-tion such as using beads and containers of zirconium oxide stabilized with yttria (95 %/5 %; speciﬁ  c gravity 6.0).   ●  Beads size: For small diameter cells (e.g. bacteria) use beads of 0.10–0.5 mm diameter. For larger cells (e.g. yeast, algae, hyphae) use beads of 0.5–1.25 mm. Glass (sp. gr. 2.5) is a good starting material due to low cost. For homogenizing plant or animal tissues that have been previously chopped with a razor, beads of 1.0–5.0 mm diameter are used.   ●  Bead density: If additional energy is needed to improve break-
age/homogenization of tough cells, then use higher density materials. These material types include ceramic (zirconium oxide family) with speciﬁ  c gravities from 3.8 to 6.0, stainless steel of sp. gr. 7.0+, and tungsten carbide of sp. gr. 14.2+. Also, the use of larger diameter beads from 2 to 20 mm can improve breakage. Recently, success has been reported with SiC grit with its sharp edges, and with stainless steel ballcones that have a wedged edge at the equator.   ●  Time savings can be achieved by ganging several samples into 96-well titer plates rather then running one sample at a time. The larger models can accommodate these plates.   ●  A simple way to evaluate the suitability of bead shaking can be done as follows. In a test tube place some glass beads and buff-ered cells/tissues. Hold the tube against a vortex shaker for 1–3 min. If breakage/homogenization is realized, then bead shaking has promise. Switching to suitable equipment as
described above will reduce repetitive strain to the technician holding the test tubes.      3    Bead Impact Methods: Stirred Agitated Beads   For modest sample quantities of 50 mL and scaling up to indus-trial amounts of several thousand liters, the agitation of the beads by a turning agitator within the vessel is the method of choice. In this class of agitated bead mills, the beads and the cell suspension are loaded into a chamber. Into the mix is placed one or more spinning discs that accelerate the beads. The beads striking the cells combined with the shearing by the moving liquid phase will disrupt the cells. 3.1  TheoryMechanical/Physical Cell Disruption Methods
6 These units are normally used for disruption of free microor-ganism cells (bacteria, yeasts, hyphae, mycelia) and not for tissue samples. For lesser quantities, see previous section on shaking con-tainer method. Materials needed to operate the agitated bead mills include the cells/tissue, grinding media (beads), liquid phase such as buffer, cooling ice or jacket ﬂ  uids, and the mill equipment. Variables include the bead selection (density, diameter, and quan-tity), speed of agitation, cell concentration, and duration of run (Figs.  3  and  4 ).     ●     Denaturing of proteins due to high temperature or excessive shear is to be considered in all mechanical disruption/homog-enization equipments. Also, the wear of the grinding media and container into the samples needs to be evaluated.   ●  Hints for successful temperature control include: (1) Pre- chilling of samples to below 5 °C. (2) Reduce residence time by
increased feed rates and then do a second pass with  inter- stage cooling. (3) Slower tip speed of Agitator discs to 6 m/s. (4) Lower the concentration of cells if viscosity increases contrib ute to excessive heating.   ●  Detrimental contamination of the batch due to the wear of either the grinding media or container walls is usually rare due to the insigniﬁ  cant amounts involved. A hint to mitigate any contamination problem is to use inert materials of construc-tion. For example, when iron would be harmful, do not use steel beads, switch to glass or ceramics. The least wear is report edly seen when using ceramic beads and containers that are fabri-cated from zirconium oxide stabilized with yttrium (95 %/5 %; speciﬁ  c gravity 6.0).  3.2  Practical Aspects  Fig. 3    Bead impact—agitated beads—Dyno-Mill with 600 mL chamber equipment        Stanley Goldberg
7 ●  For small diameter cells (e.g.  E. coli   of 0.25–1.0 μm) use beads of 0.10–0.5 mm diameter. For larger cells (e.g. yeast, algae, hyphae) use beads of 0.5–1.25 mm. Glass (sp. gr. 2.5) is a good starting material due to low cost. If addition energy is needed to improve breakage/homogenization, then switch to ceramic (zirconium oxide family) with speciﬁ  c gravities from 3.8 to 6.0.   ●  A quick preliminary test can be run with standard lab equip-ment. Load a beaker with the buffered cells/tissue along with some beads. Place on a magnetic stirrer (or use an overhead stirrer) and spin the beads. If some breakage is seen then the bead mill is a good candidate for processing the cells in question.      4    Rotor–Stator Homogenizer   Rotor/Stator homogenizers consist of a rapidly spinning paddle contained within an open-ended tube with slots near the working end. The turning paddle pushes liquid out the slots, creating a low-
pressure region that draws fresh suspension up from the open end. As the tissue is pulled up, there is a stretching action. Then, as the 4.1  Theory  Fig. 4    Bead impact—agitated stirred beads—inside view—spinning agitators moving beads against suspended cells.

8material is forced between the narrow gaps, there is a cutting action. The working part of the equipment that contacts the samples is called the generator.  The Rotor/Stator design consists of two or more coaxial inter-locking rows of teeth. The internal rotor(s) is driven with a motor running at speeds between 3,000 rpm for    the larger industrial units to 27,000 rpm for the smaller lab units. The size of the motor is chosen based on the size of the equipment and application. Rotor tip speeds of up to 50 m/s can be achieved. Usually the gap between rotor and stator is around 300–500 μm (Figs.  5  and  6 ).     ●     Choice of the rotor/stator geometry depending upon the application. Some examples of specialized generators include extended knives to cut into a larger tissue sample, low-foaming generators, and easy-cleaning units that may be autoclaved.   ●  Next choose the correct size generator for the sample volume
to be homogenized. Factory tables provide the volume ranges suitable for each generator thus selecting the correct parts is quite easy. For example, a sample of size from 0.5 mL to 5 mL 4.2  Practical Aspects  Fig. 5    Rotor–stator—Shear by spinning shaft—Polytron equipment        Stanley Goldberg
9would be best processed with a generator of 5 mm diameter. As the quantity of material to be processed at one time increases, larger sizes of generators and motors are needed.   ●  Interchangeable generators are designed to ﬁ  t onto only cer-tain motors. Therefore, one must decide which motor is the most suitable for the particular range of applications and then be sure to select only those generators designed to ﬁ  t onto that motor.   ●  The homogenizers currently available can process sample vol-umes anywhere from less than 0.5 mL up to 150,000 L. Batch    equipment (e.g. Polytron ® ) is used for small sample quantities from less than 0.5 mL though larger units can handle several hundred liters. For larger industrial in-line system for either continuous or re-circulation ﬂ  ow, there are single-, double-, or even triple-stage rotor/stator conﬁ  gurations (Megatron ® ).      5    Mortar and Pestle Tissue Grinders: Shear by Mechanical Pressure
This class of simple devices disrupts cells and homogenizes tissues by the pressure and friction generated when a moving pestle pinches the samples against the wall of the mortar. Though usually manual, there are electrically driven units available. The previous equipment class of Rotor/Stator equipment is an alternative design of this technique. Selection of proper mortar depends upon sam-ples to be processed. Materials of construction are of glass, stainless steel, Teﬂ  on, and plastics. Some units available include: Wheaton Potter-Elvehjem Tissue Grinders 2 mL samples and larger.  One practical aspect to use these devices for bacteria is to freeze the sample with liquid nitrogen.

106    High-Pressure Batch: Expanding Fluids   There are two widely used cell disruption methods that employ rapidly expanding ﬂ  uids from within the cell to explode the cell membranes. The French Press G-M ®  uses liquid under pressure, and the Parr cell disruption vessel uses compressed gases. Since these are bath operations, they are only suitable for small quantities of less than about a liter.   The French Press G-M design consists of a stainless steel cylinder (called Pressure Cell) ﬁ  tted with an exit valve at one end and a piston/plunger at the other end. Up to 35 mL of suspend-free cells in buffer are loaded into the pressure cell. With the exit valve closed the piston is pressed against the liquid by a hydraulic press, called the French Press G-M. Once a suitable pressure (up to 40 kpsi) is achieved throughout the liquid and within the cell body, then the outlet valve is opened to allow the cell suspension to drip
out at a slow rate of about 1 mL/min (9–20 drops/min). This exposure to atmospheric pressure, being much lower than the pressure that was forced within the microorganism’s body causes the liquid to rush out, and thereby rupturing the cell membrane. Normally, bacteria (at 40 kpsi) and yeast (at 20 kpsi) are handled in the French Press G-M, not tissues, plants, nor seeds (Fig.  7 ).     The Parr cell disruption vessel is a pressure vessel into which the sample to be disrupted is placed along with a dip tube ﬁ  tted with an exit valve. Suitable gas such as nitrogen at 2 kpsi is forced into the vessel and dissolved into the cells. When the exit valve is opened the gas pressure is suddenly released causing the nitrogen to come out of the solution within the cells as expanding bubbles. This action stretches the membranes of each cell until they rupture and releases the contents of the cell. Although sometimes referred to as
“explosive decompression,” nitrogen decompression is actually a gentle method.  This method is suited for treating mammalian and other membrane- bound cells, for treating plant cells, for releasing virus from fertilized eggs, and for treating fragile bacteria. It is not rec-ommended for untreated bacterial cells, unless using various pretreatment procedures to weaken the cell wall. Yeast, fungus, spores, and other materials with tough walls do not respond well to this method (Figs.  8  and  9 ).      ●      Keeping the samples cold is achieved by pre-chilling of the pressure cell. After the cells exit the valve, immediately cool by keeping the collection beaker on ice. There are no provisions to chill during the disruption process.   ●  Removal of air prior to closing the exit valve will minimize the amount of oxygen degradation of the released proteins.  6.1  Theory6.1.1  The French Press G-M ® 6.1.2  The Parr Cell Disruption Vessel6.2  Practical Aspects

12 ●  During the paced release of materials, the pressure in the  Pressure Cell will drop. This needs to be balanced by periodi-cally re-pressurizing the system by running the hydraulic press.      ●     Individual cells such as lymphocytes, leukocytes, tissue culture cells, or very fragile bacterial cells will not require pretreat-ment. Tissues must usually be pre-minced to ensure that they not plug the exit dip tube and discharge valve.   ●  The intended use of a homogenate generally determines the composition of the suspending medium. Isotonic solutions are commonly used. Solutions with higher concentrations will tend to stabilize the nucleus and organelles. Conversely, very dilute solutions will pre-stretch the cells by osmotic pressure and will render them more susceptible to disruption by the Vessel method.   ●  Very small quantities of calcium chloride, magnesium acetate, or magnesium chloride added to the suspending medium will
stabilize the nuclei when differential rupture is desired. Ratios of approximately 10 mL of suspending medium to 1 g of wet cells are commonly used to prepare the cell suspension.   ●  Small sample quantities can be held inside of a smaller test tube or beaker placed in the vessel. The inner container should be approximately twice the volume of the suspension to be treated, and the dip tube adjusted to reach the bottom of the container.  6.2.2  Parr Cell Disruption Vessel  Fig. 9    High-pressure batch—gas expansion—inside view        Stanley Goldberg
13 ●  To cool a small inner vessel, it can be ﬂ  oated on ice water within the vessel. The dip tube will hold it in place. Alternatively, the entire external unit may be chilled.   ●  Degree of disruption can be controlled by the amount of gas pressure introduced. The greater the pressure, the more homogenization. The use of moderate pressures will reduce the disruptive forces and thus leave nuclei, active mitochon-dria, and other organelles intact.       7    High-Pressure Flow: Shear Through a Valve or Tube   In high-pressure homogenizers, the liquid stream of suspended cells is forced at high pressure down a narrow channel or across the small gap of a valve. This accelerates its speed, thereby stretching and shearing cells. In some designs, the moving stream is subse-quently and abruptly impacted against an obstacle to further dam-age the cells’ membrane. Two versions of impact are (1) where the stream is directed to slam against an impingement wall (trade name
Gaulin ® ), and (2) where the stream is split into two legs of a “Y”, and these lines are then directed at one another in an interaction chamber where they collide, further disrupting the cells (trade name Microﬂ  uidics ® ). These devices are used for suspended-free cells, not for tissue samples.   The construction of the high-pressure homogenizer consists of a positive displacement pump, a homogenizing valve, and  sometimes an impingement wall or ring. Though pumps may consist of one, two, three, or ﬁ  ve plungers, most smaller laboratory homogenizers and those for cell breakage have only one plunger.  Attached to the pump is a homogenizing valve assembly that may consist of one or two stages. For cell disruption a single-stage valve is needed, typically consisting of three parts: a seat (bottom part), a valve (top part), and an impact (wear) wall or ring.  By adjusting the gap or clearance between the valve and seat,
the ﬂ ow area in the homogenizing valve is controlled. When the ﬂ ow area is reduced, pressure within the pump discharge manifold increases. When the ﬂ  ow area is increased, the pressure is reduced. The high pressure generated by the pump is converted to ﬂ  uid velocity and heat as the ﬂ  uid is discharged from the restricted area in the homogenizing valve. For cell disruption, the microorgan-isms are disrupted due to various mechanisms associated with the ﬂ uid velocity. At 100 MPa, the ﬂ  uid velocity can be as high as 450 m/s (Figs.  10  and  11 ).      These processors disrupt cells by applying a combination of shear and impact forces onto the cells. The media that contains the cells is forced through the narrow channels of the proprietary interac-tion chamber of the processor. Inside these channels, with typical 7.1  Theory7.1.1  High-Pressure Valve with Impingement Wall: Gaulin7.1.2  High-Pressure Flow Narrow Tubes or Opposed Jets:

High pressures (up to 275 MPa) are required to gener-ate the high velocities inside the interaction chamber. The result-ing shear rates can be up to 10,000,000/s and are the highest commercially available. An alternative conﬁ  guration splits the   Stanley Goldberg
15stream of pressurized cell suspension ﬂ  uid into two legs. These are then directed at one another in an interaction chamber where they collide, disrupting the cells.  This equipment is suitable for a variety of free cells (bacteria, yeasts, mammalian cells), but not seeds, tissue samples, nor plant materials. The design of identical ﬂ  uid channels in both laboratory- scale and large-scale units allows for direct scale-up from the small-est laboratory unit (14 mL batch) directly to large production units (tens of L/min) (Fig.  12 ).    ●     To process a small sample size, ﬁ  rst a liquid compatible with the continuous phase of the slurry is added to the feed hopper of the homogenizer. The machine is started and the pressure is set. When the liquid level reaches the very bottom of the feed hop-per, the cell slurry can be added quickly. The cell slurry will push the liquid ahead of it. When the slurry is observed in the
discharge, a sample can be taken. In this way, limited sample is not lost while waiting for pressure to rise to operational levels.   ●  If the product is very sensitive to heat, then it may be necessary to cool the equipment prior to introducing cell suspension and to cool the suspension immediately after it discharges from the homogenizer. A cooling coil is connected to the discharge tube of the homogenizer and is immersed in an ice water bath. Since the homogenizer is a positive displacement pump, there must be no valves or restrictions in this discharge line that could potentially shut off ﬂ  ow. Rapid chilling will minimize 7.1.3  Practical Aspects Using High- Pressure Valve with Impingement Wall: Gaulin  Fig. 12    High-pressure ﬂ  ow-opposed liquid streams—Microﬂ  uidizer inside view        Mechanical/Physical Cell Disruption Methods
16losses due to the temperature rise of 2.5 °C per 10 MPa of pressure generated during the nearly adiabatic heating during pressurization.   ●  To improve breakage, higher pressures are used up to the pump’s limits. High pressure can shorten valve life.      ●     The material should be fully thawed before processing; ice may plug the chambers.   ●  Multiple passes decrease the particle artifacts’ size. Puriﬁ  cation methods to be used after cell disruption may determine the desired particle size.   ●  Optimization with respect to process pressure and number of passes may be needed to increase the yield and facilitate subse-quent puriﬁ  cation steps.   ●  Most models are autoclavable and air driven, though some are electric-hydraulic systems. In many circumstances, especially when samples are processed multiple times, the Microﬂ  uidizer ®  proces-sors require sample cooling before and/or after processing.       8    Low Pressure: Shear by Droplet’s Impingement
Invented at Indiana University, the BioNeb ®  disruption system dis-rupts cells by a low-pressure droplet method. In the process of droplet formation, large molecules or cells suspended in the liquid being nebulized are forcefully distributed from the liquid into the forming secondary droplet. This creates a transient laminar ﬂ  ow in the microcapillary “nebulization” channel formed between the surface of the liquid and the forming secondary droplet. The lami-nar ﬂ ow in the capillary channel exerts sufﬁ  cient shearing forces to break cells. The shearing force created depends on the gas pressure applied (10–250 psi), the type of gas (nitrogen, argon, etc.) and the viscosity of the liquid. By varying these parameters, it is possi-ble to precisely regulate the magnitude of the force applied during nebulization (Fig.  13 ).   9    Ultrasonic Processors: Shear by Collapsing Bubbles   The use of sound waves in ﬂ  uids can disrupt cells. The operation
starts with normal electrical current (50 Hz or 60 Hz) being trans-formed to 20,000 Hz. This electrical signal is fed to a piezo- electric crystal causing it to oscillation at this high frequency. The vibra-tions move a titanium metal HORN about 5–15 μm. The shape of the horn ampliﬁ  es this motion to 100–150 μm/cycle. By placing the horn’s end—the tip—into ﬂ  uid, the tip moves the liquid 7.1.4  Practical Aspects: High-Pressure Narrow Tubes/Opposed Jets9.1  TheoryStanley Goldberg
17forward (away) and then retracts (back) quicker than the liquid can return. During the return stroke, the pressure in the system drops below the vapor pressure of the liquid so boiling occurs (“cavita-tion”). As the liquid ﬂ  ows back, the bubbles collapse. This bubble collapsing imparts the energy needed to disrupt the cells (Fig.  14 ).    ●     Denaturing of proteins due to high temperature or excessive shear is often noted. The equipment has ON–OFF–ON cycle adjustments available. During the OFF periods, the samples can cool. Lowered amplitude settings may reduce protein damage.   ●  Hint to improve bubble formation is to keep the system as cold as possible.   ●  Time savings can be achieved by ganging several samples into 96-well titer plates rather then running one sample at a time. Multi models can accommodate these plates. Also, some mod-els have several tips ﬁ  tted on a single horn that can handle several samples simultaneously.
several samples simultaneously.   ●  Larger quantities up to 100 L/h ﬂ  ow rates can be processed in the Sonitube. Here the entire pipe for 15 in. (35 cm) oscillates and ultrasonically processes all ﬂ  uids pumped through.      9.2  Practical Aspects  Fig. 13    Droplet low pressure nebulizer—BioNeb equipment        Mechanical/Physical Cell Disruption Methods

Initially, heat stabilization was developed to enable mass spectrometric analysis of neuropep-tides.

Measured levels of various analytes are the basis for diagnosis and the overall understanding of biology. It is thus of uttermost importance that measured levels accurately reﬂ  ect actual in vivo
levels as close as possible. Due to post-sampling changes, caused by residual enzyme activity in the sample, levels of analytes can change from their in vivo levels so that they no longer accurately reﬂ ect conditions in the living system. In the living organism, lev-els of analytes are tightly controlled by cellular signaling and homeostasis is maintained. When a sample is removed from its natural environment, a dramatic signaling cascade is initiated. In the case of a tissue biopsy the removal results in loss of blood ﬂ  ow, which subsequently leads to low oxygen levels and a switch to anaerobic metabolism. This results in low energy levels and a drop in sample pH.
22All these changes, low oxygen, low ATP and low energy are signals which are sensed on a cellular and protein level and results in an active response from the still living cells in the sample. This results in changes in protein levels as well as post-translational modiﬁ  ca-tions (PTMs). This is a very fast process which initiates within seconds of sampling and leads to measurable changes [ 1 ]. In addi tion to the initial response, primarily an active regulated response, which takes place from the moment of sampling until stabilization, by freezing or heat inactivation, there is a second response, mainly reactive in nature, which occurs during sample preparation due to residual enzyme activity in the homogenate [ 2 ]. During this phase, enzymes released from their cellular conﬁ  nement and con-trols are free to interact with whatever substrates they encounter. Both phases of enzyme    driven change post-sampling must be
adequately addressed and minimized in order to successfully measure in-vivo relevant levels of analytes.  The standard way of addressing the problem of enzymatically driven post-sampling changes have been to add chemical inhibitors and work fast while keep the samples cool during homogenization and extraction. This is only partly successful as enzyme inhibitors are selective and reduce enzyme activity rather than eliminate it [ 3 ]. A few years ago, an alternative approach, to preserving sample quality in protein studies, was introduced, the Stabilizor system [ 3 ]. The Stabilizor system accomplishes elimination of enzyme activity through heat-induced denaturation of enzymes by permanently altering the 3D protein structure of the enzymes. In contrast to chemical inhibitors, heat-induced enzyme denaturation is a general principle affecting all protein-modifying enzymes, virtually reduc-ing their activity to zero in the stabilized sample. Heat stabilization
can be introduced in the workﬂ  ow either directly after sampling with the instrument present just next to where the sample is taken or just prior to sample homogenization and extraction when sam-ples are heat denatured directly from a frozen state.  Heat stabilization has been applied to a range of samples and downstream analysis techniques. It has proven itself as a valuable tool in sample preparation for protein analysis. Initially, heat stabi-lization was developed to enable mass spectrometric analysis of neuropeptides. The applicability has since been expanded and it has been advantageously applied to a diverse array of pr otein analy sis techniques including western blot with phospho-speciﬁ  c antibod ies, top-down 2D PAGE, bottom-up phospho-shot gun, and MALDI imaging [ 4 ]. As the Stabilizor system induces protein denaturation and loss of protein 3D structure it is not suitable for sample prepa-
ration prior to analysis of enzyme activity, multi- protein complexes or formalin-ﬁ  xed epitopes, e.g. immuno- histochemistry. Using western blots, stabilization of protein phosphorylation levels has been shown. Flash-frozen and heat- stabilized samples either frozen directly or left at room  temperature for 30 min were compared. Mats Borén
23In heat-stabilized samples detected levels of phospho-proteins were more or less unaffected by 30 min at room temperature, while the non-treated samples left at room temperature showed markedly lower phosphorylation levels compared to directly ﬂ  ash-frozen or heat-stabilized,  see  Fig.  1  [ 5 ]. In a different study, a direct com-parative analysis of heat-stabilized versus ﬂ  ash-frozen samples was done using top-down 2D PAGE analysis of proteins. In that study, a majority of the low molecular spots differentially detected had a higher intensity in the ﬂ  ash-frozen samples, whereas for the dif-ferentially detected high molecular weight proteins a majority was detected with higher levels in the stabilized samples. In many cases, the low molecular weight proteins detected with higher intensity in ﬂ ash-frozen samples was identiﬁ  ed as having a higher theoreti-cal mass as compared to their gel position indicating pro tein
degrada tion by protein cleavage and degradation,  see  Fig.  2  [ 6 ]. In another application of the technology using Pro-Q Diamond staining of phosphorylated proteins separated using 2D PAGE, clear   Fig. 1    Quantitation of phospho-proteins in hippocampal lysates shows that heat-stabilized levels remain unchanged while frozen tissue levels are decreased with 30 min room temperature incubation.

Large- scale analysis of tyrosine phos-phorylations using antibody enrichment and LC-MS/MS analysis have been done to compare phosphorylation levels in heat- stabilized and ﬂ  ash-frozen samples. A clear trend toward higher phosphorylations levels in heat- stabilized samples and conse-quently lower levels in ﬂ  ash-frozen samples was detected. This is consistent with previous results showing a general decrease in most phosphorylations post-sampling due to residual phosphatase activ-ity both prior to freezing and during sample preparation,  see  Fig.  4 .      2    Materials   The Stabilizor system consists of the Stabilizor T1 instrument and Maintainor ®  sample cards used to hold the sample during treat-ment and subsequent storage.

The sample is enclosed between the plastic ﬁ  lms and the card is closed airtight prior to use in the Stabilizor instrument.        Heat denaturation of proteins cause permanent alteration of the 3D fold of proteins, which generally results in low solubility in water-based buffers.

Heat inactivation in the Stabilizor T1 is performed using a number of predeﬁ  ned programs depend-ing on the state of the sample, fresh or frozen, as well as the need to preserve sample morphology. Once the sample has been heat- stabilized, the use of correct extraction buffers and  homogenization is vital in order to resolubilize proteins and enable analysis.

will be covered. Special considerations for homogenization and resolubilization of heat-inactivated samples will be covered in Subheading  3.3 .

27  In order to minimize enzymatic driven change it is vital that the time between sampling and stabilization is kept as short as possible. When using the Stabilizor T1 instrument with fresh samples the instrument should be next to the sample source and focus should be on getting the samples heat-stabilized as fast and reproducible as possible.    1.

Start the Stabilizor T1 instrument and select the  Auto Fresh   method, if preservation of structural morphology is not needed, or  Fresh  ( Structural preserve  ) preservation of structural mor-phology is needed ( see   Note 4  ).      3.    Collect samples one at a time.      4.    Start the post-mortem clock at the moment of death; if sam-pling starts with sacriﬁ  ce ( see   Note 5  ).      5.    Preferentially sacriﬁ  ce mice without the use of anesthesia,
which have been shown to affect phosphorylation levels [ 8 ] ( see   Note 6  ).      6.    Extract sample from source and place in on open Maintainor Tissue card ( see   Note 7  ).      7.    Position the Maintainor Tissue card in the sample sledge of the Stabilizor T1 instrument and press the START button on the touch screen.      8.    When stabilization is complete, the Maintainor Tissue card with sample is ejected from the instrument.      9.    After stabilization, store samples frozen at −80 °C, either in the card or transfer to storage device of your choice, or proceed with homogenization and extraction ( see   Note 8  ).      10.    After heat inactivation proceed with homogenization and extraction as outlined in Subheading  3.3 .        Already frozen samples can also beneﬁ  t from heat inactivation as some enzymes reactive during thawing and can induce change during homogenization and after extraction. This can be useful in situations
where it is impossible or unpractical to have the instrument close to the site of sampling and for already biobanked samples. When using the Stabilizor T1 instrument with frozen samples it is important that the samples are kept frozen until they enter the instruments and brought directly from a frozen state to a denatured state.    1.    Start the Stabilizor T1 instrument and select the  Auto Frozen   method, if preservation of structural morphology is not needed, or  Frozen   ( Structural preserve  ) if preservation of struc-tural morphology is needed ( see   Note 9  ).      2.    Keep samples on dry ice or in −20 °C freezer making sure the samples remain frozen ( see   Note 10  ).   3.1  Heat Stabilization of Fresh Samples Directly After Removal from the Source3.2  Heat Stabilization of Frozen SamplesHeat Stabilization of Proteins
28   3.    Place an open Maintainor Tissue card on dry ice or in −20 °C freezer and let it equilibrate for a few minutes ( see   Note 7  ).      4.    Using a chilled forceps transfer the frozen sample to the cold card and close it.      5.    Quickly position the Maintainor Tissue card in the sample sledge of the Stabilizor T1 instrument ( see   Note 11  ). Make sure it is closed and press the START button on the touch screen.      6.    When stabilization is complete the Maintainor Tissue card with sample is ejected from the instrument. After stabilization, store samples frozen at −80 °C, either in the card or transfer to storage device of your choice ( see   Note 8  ).      7.    After heat inactivation proceed with homogenization and extraction as outlined in Subheading  3.3 .           Proteins in heat-stabilized samples will be denatured and this requires some special considerations concerning homogenization
and resolubilization buffers. Heat-treated tissue is generally more brittle then non-heated tissue so homogenization is generally not a problem but mechanical homogenization is needed for all tissues except brain. The choice of extraction buffer is on the other hand crucial and a strongly denaturing buffer is needed to resolubilize the denatured proteins in the sample. Amount of buffer to sample is also vital for good resolubilization.   Due to the denatured state of proteins in heat-inactivated samples, a denaturing buffer must be used to efﬁ  ciently resolubilize proteins from heat-stabilized samples. Depending on downstream analyti-cal technique, buffers based on urea and/or SDS have been found to work well. Buffers based on high, >8 M urea, are ideal for extracting samples for 2D PAGE and chromatographic workﬂ  ows such as LC-MS. On the other hand, SDS, >1 % SDS, based buffers are suitable for SDS-PAGE and western blot workﬂ  ows. When
using SDS buffers, it is recommended to maximize their effective-ness by heating the buffer (>90 °C) before adding it to the sample and after homogenization as instructed below. Other components such as detergents and buffering agents can be added as long as the concentrations of the denaturing agents are not affected.    To ensure full dispersion of protein–protein complexes formed during cooling after heat stabilization, it is important that sufﬁ  -cient buffer is added to the sample.    1.    Weigh samples to be extracted ( see   Note 12  ).      2.    Calculate the amount of buffer needed to reach a buffer-to- sample ratio greater than 10 (>10 μl buffer/mg sample).      3.    Add buffer to sample and proceed directly with homogenization.      3.3  Homogenization and Resolubilization of Heat-Stabilized Samples3.3.1  Denaturing Extraction Buffer3.3.2  Buffer to Sample RatioMats Borén
29  Although heat-stabilized samples will usually homogenize easily, it is very important to ensure that the initial homogenization step is thorough to facilitate the resolubilization of proteins. Soft tissue such as brain can be homogenized just using a microtip sonication rod, ﬁ  rmer tissues, e.g. liver or heart, require physical homogeniza-tion, e.g. micro pestle grinding. A combination of physical homog-enization followed by microtip sonication rod has been found to be efﬁ  cient.    1.    Place the sample in a Low Bind Eppendorf tube.      2.    Crush the sample using a micro pestle until no structure remains ( see   Note 13  ).      3.    Add sufﬁ  cient buffer to the sample so the buffer-to-sample ratio is above 10, e.g. >10 μl buffer/mg sample   .      4.    Continue homogenizing the sample–buffer mixture for at least 2 min until no pieces remain and the mix appears homogeneous.      5.    Use a microtip sonication    rod (Vibra-Cell, Sonics and Materials)
to give the mixture ten bursts of 2 s duration at 40 W setting ( see   Note 14  ).      6.    Centrifuge homogenate for 10 min at 13,000 ×  g  to pellet insoluble material.      7.    Collect supernatant and continue with analysis or store homog-enate frozen for later analysis.            1.    Heat buffer solution to near boiling, >90 °C, in a water bath.      2.    Place the sample in a Low Bind Eppendorf tube.      3.    Crush the sample using a micro pestle until no structure remains ( see   Note 13  ).      4.    Add a sufﬁ  cient volume of the hot buffer to the sample so the buffer-to-sample ratio is above 10, e.g. >10 μl buffer/mg sample.      5.    Continue homogenizing the sample–buffer mixture for at least 2 min until no pieces remain and the mix appears homogeneous.      6.    Heat tube containing sample–buffer homogenate in a heating block set to 95 °C for 5 min.      7.    Use a microtip sonication rod (Vibra-Cell, Sonics and
Materials) give the mixture ten (10) bursts of 2 s duration at 40 W setting ( see   Note 14  ).      8.    Once repeat  steps 6   and  7 .      9.    Centrifuge homogenate for 10 min at 13,000 ×  g  to pellet insoluble material.      10.    Collect supernatant and continue with analysis or store homog-enate frozen for later analysis.       3.3.3  Homogenization of Tissue in 8 M Urea Buffer Using Micro pestle Grinding Followed by Microtip Rod Sonication3.3.4  Homogenization of Tissue in Hot 1 % SDS Buffer Using Micro pestle Grinding Followed by Heating and Microtip Rod SonicationHeat Stabilization of Proteins
30  Heat-stabilized samples can be analyzed just as other samples once homogenized and extracted as described above. As long as the buf-fer is compatible with the intended downstream technique no extra steps are needed. In cases where levels of denaturant interfere with analysis, e.g. in solution antibody-based techniques like ELISA, dilution can be useful. Removal of denaturants by buffer exchange, e.g. size exclusion chromatography, can be problematic as dena-tured proteins have lower solubility in non-denaturing buffers. This can cause precipitation of proteins as the denaturant is removed and should be done with caution.   4    Notes      1.    Denaturing agents of buffers should be >1 % SDS or >8 M urea. In addition to denaturing agents other components can be added, e.g. detergents and salts, depending on the needs of the speciﬁ  c work ﬂ  ow, the SDS and/or urea contents may however not be lowered.      2.    Use dust mask to avoid getting powdered SDS into the lungs
during weighing. It is also a good idea to make a 10 % SDS stock solution to use for further dilutions to minimize the number of times powdered SDS have to be handled.      3.    As urea dissolves the solution becomes cold. Do not heat to speed up solubilization as this may create isocyanic acid which will cause protein carbamylation in later steps. Isocyanic acid can also form naturally as the urea buffer ages. To avoid this, always prepare urea containing extraction buffers fresh prior to use.      4.    Both Fresh methods, Quick and Structural preserve, will inac-tivate enzymes in the sample. The Quick method will compress the sample to make it thinner, giving a faster heating through-out the sample. The Structure preserve on the other hand use minimal compression to preserve sample structure. The sample is thus thicker and stabilization takes longer time.      5.    The Post mortem clock is basically a timer keeping track of the
time between sacriﬁ  ce and stabilization. It is important to try to keep this time as short and comparative between samples as possible. The use of the timer helps to focus attention on the dissection and avoids unnecessary delays. As dissection is an art which needs practice it is quite common for the dissection time to decrease by ~50 % between the ﬁ  rst and the ﬁ  fth animal before leveling out. It is thus good practice to either start with control animals not part of the study or a group where time is not as important.   3.4  Analysis of Extracted Heat-Stabilized SamplesMats Borén
31   6.    Cervical dislocation or a scientiﬁ  c Guillotine are examples of preferred sacriﬁ  cial techniques.      7.    Card can remain open without support if ﬁ  rst folded 180°. To minimize air in cavity after closing it, push the upper foil inwards toward the sample prior to placing the sample in the cavity.      8.    Although the heat stabilization will inactivate enzymes, other protein-modifying processes, e.g. oxidation, are still active and could induce protein changes in the sample. Stable levels of phosphorylations have been shown for up to 24 h in room temperature after heat stabilization but it is not recommended to keep stabilized samples at ambient temperatures for more than a few hours at most [ 9 ].      9.    Both Frozen methods, Quick and Structural preserve, will inactivate enzymes in the sample. The Quick method will compress the sample to make it thinner, giving a faster heating throughout the sample. The Structure preserve
on the other hand use minimal compression to preserve sample structure. The sample is thus thicker and stabiliza-tion takes longer time.      10.    The algorithms controlling treatment time for the Frozen methods are for treating samples between −78 °C and +20 °C. If samples are transported in liquid nitrogen, −196 °C, they need to be equilibrated either at −20 °C or on dry ice so they are not too cold when treated as this will result in under treatment and residual enzymatic activity.      11.    If the Maintainor Tissue cards have been cooled on dry ice longer than 1 min, hold the card between thumb and index ﬁ nger just over the orange seal during transfer to thaw it slightly. If the orange seal has frozen solid the needle can have difﬁ culty penetrating the septum.      12.    This is greatly facilitated if samples are collected in pre- weighted containers. Weigh samples one by one transferring them quickly from dry ice to the scale and read the weight as soon as
reasonable stable. Moisture in the air will start to deposit on the sample container during weighing so the scale will not ﬁ  x on a value.      13.    Pre-crushing the sample prior to adding buffer makes micro- pestle homogenization much easier. If the buffer is added ﬁ  rst it can be quite difﬁ  cult to hunt the small slippery pieces swirl-ing around in the buffer.      14.    Have sonicator tip in buffer while active and do not dip it up and down to avoid foaming. This is especially relevant with SDS-based buffers.         Heat Stabilization of Proteins

It also allows for subsequent separation of multiple cell types, resulting in the possibility to analyze different puriﬁ  ed fractions from one donor’s sample. The centrifugation step divides whole blood into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), erythro-cytes, and platelet-rich plasma. In the following, lymphocyte subtypes can be consecutively isolated from
the PBMC fraction. This chapter describes enrichment of erythrocytes, CD14-positive monocytes and CD3- positive T lymphocytes. Alternatively, other cell types can be targeted by using magnetic beads speciﬁ  c for the desired subpopulation.    Key words      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)  ,   Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS™)  ,   Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)  1      Introduction  Isolation of blood cells for research purposes should ensure optimal experimental conditions by providing maximum speciﬁ  city, purity, yield, speed, and reproducibility [ 1 ,  2 ]. Today, numerous methods for enrichment of different cell types exist, the most common being density gradient centrifugation and several variants of anti-body-based immunoafﬁ  nity methods [ 3 ,  4 ]. Density gradients are typically used to fractionate full blood into platelet-rich plasma, erythrocytes, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
composed of lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages [ 5 ,  6 ].  Cell (sub)types can be efﬁ  ciently obtained by use of immuno-afﬁ nity puriﬁ  cations [ 4 ]: These methods make use of antibodies targeting characteristic proteins like cell surface receptors, for example to attach labels for instrumental supported isolations like ﬂ uorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) [ 7 ]. Likewise, anti-bodies are immobilized on supporting material with properties suited for enrichment methods (e.g., magnetic cell sorting, MACS™).
34The MACS™ technology has been frequently used and described by us and others in terms of efﬁ  ciency and yield [ 8 ,  9 ].  In this chapter, we describe the use of density gradient cen-trifugation combined with MACS™ sorting for subsequent isola-tion of erythrocytes, monocytes, and T lymphocytes from human full blood (Fig.  1 ). This strategy offers multiple advantages: It is possible to obtain multiple cell types from one blood donation, enabling researchers to investigate multiple targets and make opti-mal use of the donor sample. The procedure can be easily adapted to other cell types by choice of the respective MACS™ beads, which are commercially available. Furthermore, magnetic cell sort-ing is of ease of use and therefore also suited for users  inexperienced with blood cell isolation.

373    Methods       1.    Blood withdrawal is to be performed by authorized medical personal only according to local legislative regulations.      2.    Prepare 4× 20 mL syringes by placing 50 μl Heparin 25,000 as anticoagulant into the inlet of the syringe before blood sam-pling ( see   Note 2  ).      3.    Fill each syringe by venipuncture of cubital vein ( see   Note 3  ).      4.    Slowly invert syringes three times to ensure homogenous mix-ing of blood and anticoagulant.      5.    Proceed to density gradient immediately.            1.    Let Pancoll ®  human adjust to room temperature for 1 h ( see   Note 4  ).      2.    Dilute 20 mL venous blood 1:1 with HBSS in a 50 mL tube. Invert three times to ensure homogenous mixing ( see   Note 5  ).      3.    Place 10 mL Pancoll ®  in a 50 mL centrifuge tube.      4.    Layer diluted venous blood slowly and carefully on top of the Pancoll ® , using an automatic pipetting device on the lowest
setting or a Peleus ball ( see  Fig.  2 ).       5.    Centrifuge for 20 min, RT, 1,250 ×  g  using a swing bucket rotor, with settings for acceleration and deceleration as low as possible ( see   Note 6  ).   3.1  Blood Sampling3.2  Density GradientDilutedbloodPancoll®  Fig. 2    Preparation of density gradient. To prepare the density gradient, begin by placing a small volume of diluted blood as slow as possible on top of the Pancoll ®  at the edge of the centrifuge tube. Stabilize the pipette by pressing it at the edges of the centrifuge tube. Wait until the blood has distributed over the Pancoll ® , then slowly move the pipette up while continuously letting the diluted blood ﬂ  ow out. Avoid too fast outlet of the blood as this will cause disturbances in the gradient, resulting in poor performance        Lymphocyte Isolation by Magnetic Cell Sorting
38   6.    The gradient should result in four clearly separated phases, listed in order of increasing density: 1st supernatant (yellowish, remaining serum constituents and platelets), 2nd PBMCs (grey phase), 3rd Pancoll ®  (clear), and 4th erythrocytes (dark r ed) at the tube bottom ( see  Fig.  1 ).      7.    Perform  all  following steps consequently on ice or at 4 °C with precooled buffers and reagents (4 °C).      8.    Prepare 2× 50 mL centrifuge tubes with 10 mL cold PBS −/−  each.      9.    Remove supernatant of gradient using a serological pipette to 1 cm above the PBMC phase.      10.    Collect the grayish PBMCs by using a plastic Pasteur pipette, starting at the edge of the tube and later moving across the plane of the PBMC layer. Place PBMCs in the prepared 50 mL tubes containing the PBS −/−  ( see  Subheading  3.4  and  Note 7  ).      11.    Remove remaining Pancoll ®  using a serologic pipette.
12.    Use remaining erythrocyte suspension for washing ( see  Subheading  3.3 ).              1.    Fill up tube from step 12  in Subheading  3.3  to 50 mL using PBS −/− .      2.    Centrifuge the erythrocytes for 8 min, 4 °C, 470 ×  g  with medium acceleration and deceleration to remove remaining contaminants from the erythrocytes ( see   Note 8  ).      3.    Discard the supernatant and the top 1–2 mL of the erythrocyte fraction to ensure complete removal of contaminants.      4.    Repeat  steps 2   and  3  with the erythrocyte fraction.      5.    Collect puriﬁ  ed erythrocytes in one centrifuge tube and store at −80 °C until usage.              1.    Fill centrifuge tube from step 3.3. 10 to 50 mL with PBS −/−  and invert 3 times to wash the PBMC fraction.      2.    Centrifuge the PMBCs for 8 min, 4 °C, 470 ×  g  to remove remaining contaminants ( see   Note 9  ).      3.    Discard supernatant and resuspend the PBMCs in 1 mL PBS −/− .
4.    Unite PBMCs from two tubes into one fresh 50 mL centrifu-gation tube, ﬁ  ll up to 50 mL with PBS −/−  and repeat  step 2  .      5.    Discard supernatant and resuspend PBMCs from all remaining tubes in 1 mL PBS.      6.    Take up an aliquot for cell counting.

The MACS™ buffer is best prepared on the day before the cell isolation.      2.    The described protocol was originally designed for large yields for proteomics experiments without further culture of the cells and is therefore based on a large blood donation of 80 mL [ 9 ]. The procedure is adaptable to any other volume by propor-tionally adjusting volumes of Pancoll ®  and MACS™ beads. Magnetic cell sorting can also be performed directly from full blood, but the density gradient will help to pre-purify and con-centrate the PBMCs in a small volume for MACS™ isolation.      3.    The appropriate blood sampling system/adapters should be
chosen by authorized and experienced medical personal.      4.    Cold Pancoll ®  has a different density than warm Pancoll ®  which can cause inefﬁ  cient separation in density gradient. Remove Pancoll ®  from freezer before blood sampling is per-formed to ensure that there is no time delay between sampling and gradient.   3.7  Quality Control Using FACSFrederic Brosseron et al.
41   5.    This step is necessary to adjust the density of the blood for the gradient.      6.    Fixed angle rotors and strong acceleration or deceleration will cause inefﬁ  cient separation in gradient.      7.    When collecting the PBMCs, include parts of the supernatant and Pancoll ®  to ensure complete harvest of the PBMCs. The following washing and magnetic cell isolation will remove the contaminants.      8.    Erythrocytes will not form a pellet, but a concentrated suspension.      9.    This step can be performed together with  step 2   in Subheading  3.4 .      10.    The necessary amount of cells for FACS analysis depends on the used instrument and measurement protocols.      11.    FACS analysis should be performed in a lab with high experience in analysis of mononuclear cells.

Therefore, overweight today is the major risk factor for developing various metabolic complications such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic liver disease, and cardiovascular diseases [ 2 – 6 ].  Over the last decade we have learned that adipose tissue, besides its predominant role within energy homeostasis also represents a major endocrine organ, releasing a wide variety of signaling and mediator proteins. These so-called adipokines seem to be causally involved in the development of a wide variety of metabolic dis eases. Over the last years, several attempts have been made to characterize
the adipokines by utilizing diverse proteomic proﬁ  ling approaches. This has led to a catalog of adipokines comprising several hundred potentially secreted peptides and proteins [ 7 ]. Nevertheless, the lim-ited overlap of identiﬁ  ed adipokines in  published studies impres sively
44illustrates that the analysis of tissue- speciﬁ  c secretomes is an extreme challenging business.  Within the complex workﬂ  ow including sample preparation, concentration, proteomic proﬁ  ling and extensive bioinformatics, the most striking point is to discriminate the real secretome from contaminating proteins. Therefore, a meaningful characterization inalienable starts with high-quality samples and requires a repro-ducible processing as crucial points for successful identiﬁ  cation of secreted proteins. Particularly during sample collection and cultur-ing processes considerable contaminations could occur from dif-ferent sources, e.g. release of cellular proteins due to cell damage or contamination of high-abundant proteins derived from culture, i.e. FCS. Due to the fact that the expected concentrations of adi-pokines are low (pg to ng/ml), artiﬁ  cial proteins have the potential to shift the dynamic range of the secretome sample dramatically.
In the light of these possible pitfalls, a careful evaluation of sample preparation and culture setup to minimize contamination are the most crucial steps in order to obtain relevant secretome data [ 7 ,  8 ].  2    Materials       1.

The samples are centrifuged for 45 min at 85,000 ×  g  and 4 °C to get rid of remaining cell debris.      2.

A growing number of peptides are described which are produced and released by the muscle ﬁ  bers and work in an autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine fashion. The contraction-induced secretion of these myokines is considered to contribute to the health-promoting effects of exercise. To gain further insights into the molecular pro-
cesses that occur during contraction an in vitro exercise model, electric pulse stimulation (EPS), was estab-lished. Recent publications show that this model is suitable to electro-stimulate human skeletal muscle cells and thus mimic muscle contraction in vitro. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for the proteomics-based analysis of the human muscle secretome, starting with the cultivation of human myotubes and their electric pulse stimulation, ending with sample preparation for targeted and untargeted proteome analysis of the cell culture supernatant. This whole workﬂ  ow should allow deeper insights into the complex nature of the muscle secretome and the identiﬁ  cation of new myokines which might help to understand the crosstalk of the working muscle with different organs and the beneﬁ  cial effects of exercise.

1      Introduction  It is commonly accepted that regular physical activity entails multiple health-promoting effects, plays a key role in the preven-tion and treatment of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases [ 1 ] and r educes systemic inﬂ  ammation [ 2 ]. For decades, it was hypoth-esized that circulating factors are produced and released from the contracting muscle and enable the communication between the energy-demanding muscle and the energy-supplying organs like adipose tissue and liver during exercise [ 3 ]. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) was ﬁ  rst discovered as such an “exercise factor” when a higher expression and release of this cytokine was detected in human  skeletal muscle after contraction [ 4 ] and the putative function of IL-6 as enhancer of endogenous glucose production in exercising
56humans was described [ 5 ]. With this cytokine the concept of m yokines, peptides produced and released by the muscle ﬁ  bers which work in an autocrine, paracrine and endocrine fashion arose [ 6 ]. Exercise seems to be an important stimulus for the expression and secretion of several myokines including amongst others IL-7, IL-8, Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), Myostatin, and Irisin [ 6 ].  Although over the last decade many attempts have been made to identify the complex human muscle secretome, the knowledge on myokines and their expression and release especially during contraction is still very limited and incomplete. The global proteomics- based search for exercise factors in human plasma samples is still very challenging due to a concentration range of several orders of magnitude of the dif ferent secreted protein species as recently discussed [ 7 ]. Proteins and peptides released from mus-cle ﬁ bers are supposed to reach only very low molecular concentra-
tions in the circulation. Certainly, one additional problem is the identiﬁ  cation of the muscle cell per se as secretory unit of these circulating exercise factors. Several myokines are not only secreted by the muscle but also by other tissues, e.g. adipose tissue and liver.  To overcome these limitations, electric pulse stimulation (EPS) has been applied to human myotubes and the suitability of this model for the identiﬁ  cation of myokines was tested. During the last years EPS has been established as in vitro exercise model, which enables the analysis of molecular processes that are occurring dur-ing exercise in differentiated skeletal muscle cells. In this model, the in vivo motor nerve activation of the muscle is replaced by electric pulses leading to Ca 2+  transients that induce contraction and de novo sarcomere formation in murine C2C12 myotubes and human primary myotubes [ 8 – 11 ]. In human muscle cell culture,
the EPS-induced contraction leads to an increased glucose uptake and expression of several proteins involved in oxidative phosphory-lation [ 9 ,  12 ]. In a recent paper, we were able to show that EPS of human myotubes leads to an activation of the MAP kinase signal-ing cascade which results amongst others in an altered myokine expression and that this in vitro exercise model is indeed suitable to analyze the contraction-induced secretome proﬁ  le of muscle cells [ 11 ]. In this study, we compared the transcriptional proﬁ  le of con-trol cells vs. EPS cells and found 153 signiﬁ  cantly upregulated transcripts with fold changes > 1.3 times including 35 genes encod-ing for secreted proteins. Amongst the top 10 regulated genes with highest fold increases, 7 were supposed to be secreted as proteins. In an immunobead-based assay 12 of 23 analytes were signiﬁ  cantly enriched in the EPS supernatant. Using a similar approach, Raschke
et al. analyzed conditioned medium of EPS and control cells and identiﬁ  ed 48 contraction-induced myokines [ 13 ]. These results indicate that the EPS model can be used to study the human  muscle secretome by a global proteomics-based approach. Mika Scheler et al.

583    Methods       1.    Thaw, seed, and proliferate human skeletal muscle cells ( see   Note 2  ) in Cloning medium on 150 cm 2  plates. Change medium every 2–3 days until cells are 80–90 % conﬂ  uent.      2.    Trypsinate cells and seed at least 20,000 myoblasts per well on 6-well dishes.      3.    When cells are 80 % conﬂ  uent change medium and differenti-ate cells to multinucleated myotubes (Fig.  1 ) with Fusion medium for 6–7 days. Change medium every 2–3 days.              1.    Change medium directly before start of stimulation ( see   Note 3  ).      2.    Insert electrodes, set culture dish including electrodes into incubator and wire with power supply (Fig.  1 ;  see   Note 4  ).      3.    Turn on power supply, adjust the proper program and start stimulation. The intensity and duration of stimulation has to be established for each cell type. We use 14 V, 5 Hz and 2 ms in the basic mode for up to 24 h. The RNA expression of sev-
eral secreted proteins is increased after less prolonged stimula-tion, but 24 h are needed to signiﬁ  cantly increase glucose consumption and lactate production [ 11 ]. Application of higher frequencies (30 Hz) for 4 h leads to an increased phos-phorylation of p70S6K1 and expression of  MYOD , both depicting high- intensity resistance training leading to increased muscle protein synthesis and muscle hypertrophy [ 11 ]. For the proteomics- based investigation of secreted proteins, it is neces-sary to minimize the contamination with proteins released from damaged cells. The absence of EPS-induced cell damage should be veriﬁ  ed by the quantiﬁ  cation of cytosolic or mito-chondrial localized proteins in the supernatant, e.g. by creatine kinase (CK) activity, also used as plasma marker for muscle ﬁ ber damage [ 15 ] ( see   Note 5  ). The inﬂ  uence of the applied EPS protocol on the cell viability might also be tested using,
e.g. the XTT assay. The EPS protocol of 14 V, 5 Hz, 2 ms for 24 h does not decrease the viability of human myotubes or induce the release of CK (Fig.  2a, b  ; adapted from [ 11 ]).       3.1  Cell Culture3.2  Electric Pulse StimulationFig. 1  (continued) myotubes (immunostaining shows MyHC II, a fast-type skeletal muscle myosin in  green  ; nuclei are shown in  blue  (DAPI staining)). 2. After 6–7 days of differentiation myotubes are electro-stimu-lated. Therefore, the elec trodes dip into the media in the cell culture dish and the whole “sandwich” is put into the incubator. A cable connects the electrode (C-dish) with the power supply (C-Pace EP system) outside (after IonOptix, Dublin, Ireland; detailed brochure: Culture Pacing System). 3. For targeted analysis of the muscle secretome small amounts of media are sufﬁ  cient whereas untargeted analysis needs larger amounts of media which should be free of FBS and phenol red       Mika Scheler et al.

60   Usually cell culture medium contains FBS to stimulate cell prolif-eration or in case of serum-reduced media like Fusion media to maintain the viability of the cell. The high abundance of serum proteins in the FBS requires additional enrichment of low- abundant proteins, e.g. using Proteominer technology or metabolic labeling with deuterated amino acids [ 16 ,  17 ]. An efﬁ  cient and sensitive way to analyze protein signatures in FBS containing supernatant is via commercially available multiplex bead-based immunoassays ( see   Notes 6   and  7 ). The following steps are necessary to collect conditioned medium and prepare it for measuring with multiplex bead-based immunoassays.    1.    Directly after end of stimulation, take off medium and put on ice until proceeding with the next step ( see   Note 8  ).      2.    To remove detached cells, spin supernatant with 2,700 ×  g  for 4 min at 4 °C.      3.    Transfer supernatant in a new tube and store at −80 °C until
used for further analysis.   3.3  Collection of Medium for Targeted Secretome Studies00.20.40.60.811.2con EPSa bcAbsorbance 450nm(fold change)051015200250con EPS con EPSCK activity (U/L)SN lysate 0 5 10 15200250con EPS con EPSLDH activity (U/L)SN lysate**  Fig. 2    EPS does not induce cytotoxicity.

61   4.    When using a validated multiplex kit, proceed according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( see   Notes 8  – 10 ).      5.    Protein concentrations of the analytes can be calculated with the appropriate optimized standard cur ves using the appropri ate software.        An untargeted proteomic proﬁ  ling approach enables the discovery of novel contraction-induced myokines and helps to identify speciﬁ  c and sensitive biomarkers secreted from the muscle. Untargeted approaches can either be performed by gel-based separation tech-niques, e.g. 1- and 2D electrophoresis and subsequent staining of the gels or by gel-free separation via HPLC or CE. Proteins can be visualized on gels by ﬂ  uorescence labeling before electrophoresis (e.g. DIGE) or by staining of the gels after electrophoresis (e.g. silver staining). In all cases, subsequent protein analysis is usually MS-based [ 14 ]. In the following part the sample preparation for
both separation techniques is described. For LC-MS/MS only small samples sizes are needed whereas for 1- or 2D electrophore-sis huge amounts of protein are necessary ( see   Note 11  ). Nevertheless, latter application is the method of choice for visual-ization of the sample composition, its complexity and quality.    1.    For untargeted proﬁ  ling Fusion medium without FBS has to be used during stimulation to prevent the contamination of proteins included in the serum. To decrease any serum carry overs wash cells 2× with PBS containing Ca 2+ /Mg 2+  and 1× with standard PBS ( see   Note 12  ).      2.    Use 2 mL/well Fusion medium without FBS and phenol red ( see   Note 13  ) and start stimulation according to Subheading  3.2 .      3.    Directly after stimulation end, take off supernatant and spin down detached cells with 800 ×  g  for 5 min at 4 °C to remove any cell debris.      4.    Remaining insoluble material is separated by a further centrifu-
gation step (45,000 ×  g , 5 min, 4 °C).      5.    Supernatant can be frozen at −80 °C for further proceeding at this point.      6.    Either continue directly with the unfrozen supernatant or thaw the supernatant on ice. Since the native protein concentration is in the lower μg/mL range, the supernatant has to be concen-trated by spin concentration devices (cutoff 3 kDa) until a protein concentration of 1–3 mg/mL is reached ( see   Note 14  ).      7.    Concentrated supernatant is stored at −80 °C until further analysis via gel-based or gel-free protein separation technique and subsequent MS-based protein analysis [ 14 ].    3.4  Collection of Medium for Untargeted ProteomicsAnalysis of the Human Muscle Secretome
624       Notes      1.    Be sure to use 6-well dishes that ﬁ  t with the C-dishes (electr odes). The IonOptix handbook proposes 6-well dishes of several companies. To avoid contaminations, heat the electrodes at 100 °C for 3 h. After experiment soak electrodes in demineral-ized water for several days to neutralize from salts that might have formed on the carbon electrodes and sterilize again.      2.    Experiments are performed on the ﬁ  rst and second passage of subcultured cells.      3.    We use 2 mL medium per well (6-well dish). Be sure that the electrodes dip into the medium and do not contact the bottom of the dish containing the cells.      4.    Be careful that the cable is not kinked by the incubator door since it can be damaged then.      5.    Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is another marker for muscle ﬁ ber damage [ 15 ]. After 24 h of EP-stimulation, LDH is sig-niﬁ cantly increased in the total cell lysates of EPS cells and also
in the supernatant. These data suggest that elevated levels of cytosolic proteins in the secretome needs to be considered carefully and do not necessarily indicate higher percentage of damaged cells (Fig.  2c ; adapted from [ 11 ]).      6.    For the selection of candidate myokines it might be helpful to do a whole genome transcriptome analysis or quantitative Real-time PCR prior to secretome study to ﬁ  nd EPS-regulated proteins.      7.    The multiplex assays have several advantages. Only a small sample volume is necessary due to its high sensitivity. Additionally, it is easy to handle, enables an exact quantiﬁ  ca-tion in a concerted system. The biggest advantage compared to commercial available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the measurement of several proteins simultaneously in one assay.      8.    During immunoassay antibodies might cross-react with pro teins of FBS, hence a sample of unconditioned medium (reference
medium) is urgently needed for multiplex measurement. Spin down the reference medium according to methods in  step 2   in Subheading  3.3  and store supernatant at −80 °C until used for further analysis.      9.    When mixing individual singleplexes check x-Plex Bead Regions and avoid using 2 singleplexes with similar x-Plex Bead Regions in one assay.      10.    For the conditioned medium of human myotubes, neat  samples were used (50 μL sample/well). In our case, all measured ana-Mika Scheler et al.
63lytes were in the assay working range. If you are above the upper limit of quantiﬁ  cation make sure to dilute the samples properly.      11.    For comprehensive analysis of the secretome via 2DE, a pro-tein concentration up to mg/mL range is required. In the spe-cial case of DIGE technology at least 150 μg protein is essential. Thus, huge amounts of medium are necessary.      12.    To get rid of the complex protein mixture included in FBS, cells are washed 2 times with PBS containing Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ . This is used to wash adherent cell cultures when one merely wishes to wash and have the cells remain adherent because adhesion proteins require divalent cations to function. The third wash-ing step is done with PBS without Ca 2+ /Mg 2+  to decrease salt concentration in the medium.      13.    For untargeted proteomics the medium should be free of phe-nol red because it might interfere with protein assays performed to determine protein concentration for subsequent gels.
14.    Since the native protein concentration is very low, it is essential to concentrate the supernatant to achieve a working concen-tration for subsequent gels. It might be necessary to transfer the supernatant during concentration process in an even smaller protein concentrator tube to gain smaller volumes and the required protein concentration. Be aware that with every change of the device material gets lost. To minimize the loss, rinse the membranes of the larger device with ﬂ  ow through and add it to the eluent of the smaller device. Additionally, take care of protein precipitations that might form.           Acknowledgements  This study was supported in part by a grant from the Leibniz Gemeinschaft (SAW-FBN-2013-3) to C.

Current studies mainly
perform analyses of the urine supernatant devoid of cells and cell debris, and the pellet (or sediment) frac-tion is discarded. However, the pellet fraction is biologically of interest. It may contain whole human cells shed into the urine from anatomically proximal tissues and organs (e.g., kidney, prostate, bladder, urothe-lium, and genitals), disintegrated cells and cell aggregates derived from such tissues, viruses and microbial organisms which colonize or infect the urogenital tract. Knowledge of the function, abundance, and tissue of origin of such proteins can explain a pathological process, identify a microbe as the cause of urinary tract infection, and measure the human immune response to the infection-associated pathogen(s). Successful detection of microbial species in the urinary pellet via proteomics can serve as a clinical diagnostic alterna-tive to traditional cell culture-based laboratory tests. Filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) has been widely used in shotgun
(FASP) has been widely used in shotgun proteomics. The methodology presented here implements an effective lysis of cells present in urinary pellets, solubilizes the majority of the proteins derived from microbial and human cells, and generates enzymatic digestion-compatible protein mixtures using FASP followed by optimized desalt-ing procedures to provide a peptide fraction for sensitive and comprehensive LC-MS/MS analysis. A highly parallel sample preparation method in 96-well plates to allow scaling up such experiments is discussed as well. Separating peptides by nano-LC in one dimension followed by online MS/MS analysis on a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer, we have shown that more than 1,000 distinct microbial proteins and 1,000 distinct human proteins can be identiﬁ  ed from a single experiment.

66  MS    Mass spectrometry     MWCO    Molecular weight cut off     TIC    Total ion chromatogram     UTI    Urinary tract infection   1        Introduction   Urine is a sample source of high importance for biomarker discov-ery because it is easily available and collected non-invasively in large quantities [ 1 ,  2 ]. The identity and quantity of proteins excreted into urine may reﬂ  ect pathological conditions that can be traced to different organs in the body, particularly the kidneys, prostate, and urogenital tract [ 3 ]. Currently, most urine proteomic studies focus on the analysis of the urinary supernatant, that is the soluble fraction of the collected urine sample following centrifuga-tion at 1,500–5,000 ×  g  for 5–15 min [ 4 ,  5 ]. The resulting urinary pellet is frequently discarded. However, the urinary pellets, espe-cially those from patients with urinary tract infection (UTI), which is one of the most common conditions that lead to hospital visits
[ 6 ], contain not only pathogenic microbes, in most cases bacteria that colonize the urinary tract of the patient, but also host proteins associated with the inﬂ  ammatory process following colonization with the microbial pathogen. Inﬂ  ammation may include activities such as recognition of pathogen molecular patterns, cytokine release, leukocyte recruitment, lymphocyte recruitment, comple-ment activation, immunoglobulin secretion, ﬁ  brin deposition, release of iron-sequestering proteins and direct microbial killing via enzymatic activities and permeabilization or disintegration of bacterial membranes [ 6 – 8 ]. The presence and relative quantity of such proteins serve as a diagnostic indicator of infection and inﬂ  am-mation [ 7 ]. Non-pathogenic bacteria not inducing inﬂ  ammatory responses may also be identiﬁ  ed from urinary pellets [ 9 ].  Our laboratory reported the ﬁ  rst metaproteomic analysis of
urinary pellets derived from patients diagnosed with either asymp-tomatic bacteriuria or UTI, and identiﬁ  ed the microbial causes of bacteriuria [ 9 ]. Most recently, our laboratory developed a high- throughput urinary sample preparation approach, 96FASP (96- well ﬁ  lter-aided sample preparation), for quantitative shotgun proteomic analysis [ 10 ]. This method promises to be the proto-type of an economical method for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections and inﬂ  ammation in the future. This article describes an extensively used, robust step-by-step procedure pertaining to the preparation of urinary pellet samples using the FASP approach. The optional 96FASP method that is adapted to process multiple samples simultaneously is described as well.  Yanbao Yu and Rembert Pieper

The schematic also shows the downstream applications (e.g., LC-MS/MS and database search) for urinary proteome analysis.        1.    Take urine samples ( see   Note 1  ), centrifuge at 3,000 ×  g  for 15 min at 4 °C, discard the urine supernatant and recover the pellet, retaining ~1.0 ml of residual urine supernatant to avoid disturbing the pellet.      2.    Add ~10 ml ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline PBS, gently shake the tube and centrifuge for another 15 min at 3,000 ×  g .
Discard the supernatant and store the wet pellet in −80 °C or process immediately.      3.    Add USED buffer ( see   Note 2  ) consistent with an approxi-mate volume ratio of 4:1 (buffer volume/urinary pellet vol-ume) to lysis cells and solubilize the contents in the urinary pellet. If the urinary pellet volume is very small, a minimum of 100 μl USED buffer volume can be added.      4.    Vortex vigorously for 10 s a few times to resuspend the pellet; pipette up and down to resuspend the pellet if the vortexing step was not sufﬁ  cient to homogenize the pellet. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature and vortex or ﬂ  ick tube occasionally.      5.    Using Misonex Sonicator (with the water bath attached, not the probe), put the urinary lysate into an ice/water-ﬁ  lled water bath. Set the program on amplitude 9 for nine 45-s cycles with 45-s intermittent cooling of the urinary lysate sample(s).
6.    Let the urinary lysate sample(s) sit for approximately ﬁ  ve more minutes. Spin urinary lysate sample(s) in a bench-top centri-fuge at maximum speed (14,000 ×  g ) for 10 min, and transfer lysate supernatant to a new 1.7 ml microtube ( see   Note 3  ). Freeze the urinary lysate at −80 °C if necessary.            1.    Before processing pellet lysate using FASP, ﬂ  ush the ﬁ  lters with 200 μl NaOH (100 mM) and 200 μl UA buffer once separately.      2.    Aliquot a volume equivalent to 10–100 μg total protein quantity into Vivacon 500 ﬁ  lter device, and mix with 200 μl UA buffer.   3.1  Lysis of Urinary Pellets and Collection of Lysates3.2  FASP Processing Urinary Pellet Samples for Shotgun ProteomicsYanbao Yu and Rembert Pieper
69   3.    Spin at 14,000 ×  g  for 10–30 min.      4.    Add 200 μl UA buffer and repeat the spin at 14,000 ×  g  to concentrate until the volume in the ﬁ  lter unit is reduced to ~10 μl.      5.    Add 100 μl of the IAA solution (ﬁ  nal concentration 50 mM) and mix by vortexing ﬁ  lter unit for 1 min. Incubate without mixing for 20 min in the dark at ambient temperature.      6.    Spin at 14,000 ×  g  for 10–30 min. Discard ﬂ  ow-through from collection tube.     Fig. 1    An overview of the urinary pellet sample preparation for shotgun proteomics. The procedures are explained in detail in this chapter. Brieﬂ  y, the urine samples are ﬁ  rst spin down to collect pellet fraction. The pellets are then lysed and digested following FASP protocol. A protocol of 96-well format FASP is also illustrated. Afterwards, the protein digests are cleaned using StageTip and analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS. The host and pathogen protein
identiﬁ  cations can be obtained by searching a metaproteome database which includes human proteins as well as the proteins of common pathogens related to your study (in this case, the urinary tract infection)        Urinary Pellet Proteomics
70   7.    Add 200 μl of UA buffer and spin at 14,000 ×  g  for 10–30 min. The ﬁ  nal sample volume in the ﬁ  lter unit should be 20 μl or less.      8.    Add 200 μl of ABC buffer and spin at 14,000 ×  g  for 10–15 min. Add 200 μl of ABC buffer and repeat spin step once more.      9.    Add 100 μl of ABC buffer to ﬁ  lter unit and trypsin so that the ﬁ nal protein:trypsin ratio is 100:1. Mix by vortexing for 1 min. Transfer the ﬁ  lter to a new ﬁ  lter collection tube.      10.    Incubate at 37 °C overnight in a temperature-controlled incu-bator (12–16 h).      11.    On the next day, add 200 μl of ABC buffer, spin the ﬁ  lter unit at 14,000 ×  g  for 10–15 min and collect the ﬁ  ltrate (with the peptide mixture) into a maximum recovery tube.      12.    Add 100 μl of ABC buffer to ﬁ  lter unit and trypsin so that the ﬁ nal protein:trypsin ratio is 100:1, and re-incubate the tube at 37 °C for another 4–6 h.
37 °C for another 4–6 h.      13.    Add 200 μl of ABC buffer, spin the ﬁ  lter unit after this second digestion step at 14,000 ×  g  for 10–15 min and collect the sec-ond ﬁ  ltrate (with the peptide mixture) into the same maxi-mum recovery tube.      14.    Add another 200 μl of ABC buffer, spin the ﬁ  lter unit after the wash step at 14,000 ×  g  for 10–15 min and collect the wash (with residual peptides) into the same maximum recovery tube. The ﬁ  nal volume in the collection tube is ~600 μl.      15.    Dry the peptide solution using a Speed-Vac (this may take 2–3 h). The tryptic peptide mixture is ready now for desalting with the StageTip method.            1.    Instead of using individual Vivacon ﬁ  lters to process urinary pellet samples separately, one can use 96-well ﬁ  lter plate to process multiple samples simultaneously. This could be a good option when tens or hundreds of samples have to be analyzed [ 10 ].
analyzed [ 10 ].      2.    All the following procedures are the same as described above for single ﬁ  lter processing; there are a couple of changes:    (a)    Each spin takes place on plate centrifuged at 2,600 ×  g  for 45–90 min.      (b)    The collection plate should be polypropylene-based (e.g., to reduce possible non-speciﬁ  c bindings).      (c)    The lid of the 96-well ﬁ  lter plate cannot seal the plate very well; to avoid sample drying out after overnight incuba-tion, paraﬁ  lm could be used to warp and tightly seal the lid. In the meantime, at least 100 μl ABC buffer should be added into each well for overnight digestion.          3.3  (Optional) 96-Well Filter Plate Processing Urinary Pellet Samples for Shotgun ProteomicsYanbao Yu and Rembert Pieper
71      1.    This method is adapted from a published protocol [ 11 ]; sev-eral changes have been made to optimally ﬁ  t the preparation of urinary pellet samples ( see   Note 4  ).      2.    Prepare StageTip by punching out small discs (1–3 layers depending on the sample amount) of C18 Empore ﬁ  lter using a 22 G ﬂ  at-tipped syringe and ejecting the discs into P200 pipette tips. Ensure that the disc is securely wedged in the bot-tom of the tip.      3.    Activate a tip by forcing 200 μl methanol through the tip. Use this step to check if the StageTip is leaky or overtight.      4.    Force 200 μl Elution Solution-II through the tip.      5.    Equilibrate tip by forcing 200 μl Wash and equilibration buf-fer through the tip. The tip is now ready for sample loading.      6.    Resuspend the dried peptides into 100 μl of Wash and equili-bration buffer, and vortex for 10 min.      7.    Load the 100 μl peptide solution—made in step [ 5 ] above—
by forcing them through the C18-StageTip. Do not discard the ﬂ ow-through, but collect it into the original tube.      8.    Reload the peptide solution onto the tip. This step may be repeated two or three times.      9.    Wash the tip with 200 μl Wash buffer, and repeat this step one or two times. The ﬂ  ow-through during this step can be discarded.      10.    Elute the peptides with 200 μl Elution Solution-I (once) and 200 μl Elution Solution-II (twice). Collect all of the eluates (~600 μl) into one maximum recovery microtube.      11.    Dry the peptide eluates in the Speed-Vac (this may take 1–2 h).      12.    Store then at −80 °C, or resuspend it with LC solvent A for immediate LC-MS/MS analysis.            1.    Resuspend the dried peptide samples into 20–50 μl LC solvent A, centrifuge at maximal speed for 3–5 min, transfer to sample vials and load to HPLC autosampler.      2.    The LC-MS/MS analysis is operated by an Ultimate 3000
nano LC system and Q Exactive mass spectrometer. Around 2–5 μl of the samples were ﬁ  rst loaded onto a trap column at high ﬂ  ow rate 5 μl/min, and then separated on a PicoFrit ana-lytical column at a nano ﬂ  ow rate of 300 nl/min. For a 2-h LC-MS run, a linear gradient was applied from 100 % solvent A to 35 % solvent B over 100 min, followed by a steeper gradi-ent to 80 % solvent B over 15 min. The column was re-equili-brated with solvent A for 5 min. Eluting peptides were acquired in data- depended mode using XCalibur software and top10 method as described before [ 10 ].   3.4  Peptide Desalting Using StageTip Protocol3.5  Nano-LC-MS/MS and Computational AnalysisUrinary Pellet Proteomics
72   3.    The acquired raw ﬁ  les are then processed using the Proteome Discoverer software. The protein database involved in this study contains UniProt human protein sequences and com-mon urinary tract pathogens [ 12 ]. They can be downloaded from UniProt website (  http://www.uniprot.org/    ). MS search parameters are similar to published previously [ 10 ].      4.    Figure  2  shows a typical nanoLC-MS/MS analysis of the uri-nary pellet samples. The base peak of the TIC shows the eluted peptides from HPLC column are acquired by mass spectrom-eter in 120 min. Shown in the upper panel is a representative full MS scan collected at retention time 75.28 min. The mass of each peak (peptide) are accurately measured by the Orbitrap- based mass analyzer at high resolution (e.g., 70,000), and then sequenced in the HCD-based collision cell. The resulting   Fig. 2    A typical LC-MS analysis of the urinary pellet sample. The full mass (MS) and fragmentation (MS/MS)
are recorded by high resolution and high accuracy mass spectrometer. A representative MS scan at a given time (for example,  t  = 75.3 min, as indicated by the  red bar   and  arrows   in the  lower panel  ) with mass and charge state information (for example,  m / z  = 668.3510,  z  = 2) is shown in the  middle panel  . Most of the ions in this spectrum will be isolated and fragmentized afterwards. Then, the bioinformatics tool (for example, Sequest algorithm) will assign the most conﬁ  dent amino acid sequence to each peak based on the sophisticated scor-ing system. Detailed explanations of the ﬁ  gure are provided in this chapter        Yanbao Yu and Rembert Pieper
73fragments are measured again by the Orbitrap analyzer with high resolution (e.g., 17,500). With high quality MS and MS/MS data (mass errors are shown for each peak in the ﬁ  gure), database search engine (e.g., Sequest) will assign each peak a unique amino acid sequence and its corresponding  protein, as indicated by triangles (red, E.coli proteins; black, human proteins) in the MS scan. The peak  m / z  = 846.0721 is magni-ﬁ ed in the right window. The  cysteine in protein TRFL has a carbamidomethyl modiﬁ  cation. The gray diamond (    ) shows a keratin peptide (VDALMDEINFMK,  ∆  = −2.74 ppm; [K2C5_HUMAN]). In this single LCMS analysis, 2,198 pro-teins, including human (1,139) and bacterial proteins (1,059), were successfully identiﬁ  ed.        4    Notes      1.    Usually 5–50 ml of urine is collected from human subjects. The preferred approach is to process the urine sample immediately after collection by centrifugation ( see   step 2  ). It is possible to
store the urine at 4 °C for up to 6 h before centrifugation. Finally, the entire urine sample may be stored at −80 °C at the clinical site, shipped to the site of proteomic analysis and thawed prior to centrifugal separation of urinary supernatant and uri-nary pellet. The freeze–thaw step may alter the composition of the urinary pellet. For a given project with multiple samples, a distinct urine storage and processing method should be selected.      2.    In the case that gram-positive bacteria with thick cell walls, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, are suspected to be present in urine samples, resuspend the urinary pellet samples in a volume of TMN buffer to have an approximate volume ratio of 1:10, usually less than 200 μl. Pipette the suspension up and down a few times in a 1.5 ml tube. Add lysostaphin and mutanolysin to a ﬁ  nal concentra-tion of 20 μg/ml. Mix gently to homogenize the enzymes and
suspended cells. Incubate the sample in the 37 °C shaker-incu-bator. Take out the tube every 30 min and check if a pellet collects at the bottom. If so, brieﬂ  y vortex every 30 min. Complete digestion after a 3 h incubation.  After pre-treatment with lysostaphin and mutanolysin, add up to 600 μl USED buffer into the lysate.      3.    To estimate the protein concentration, take 10 μl aliquot of the supernatant to another new microtube, mix with SDS loading buffer and run it in a SDS-PAGE gel. Load 2 and 5 μg BSA standards in the same gel. Coomassie Blue (CB)-G250 stain the gel followed by its destaining with standard proce-dures [ 13 ]. From the overall CB-G250 staining intensity of urinary pellet lysate bands, estimate the total protein amount Urinary Pellet Proteomics

Consequently, a plethora of conditions which are toxic to cells are known to directly attack these organelles. However, mitochondria originating from different tissues differ in their sensitivity to toxic insults. Thus, in order to
predict the potential organ-speciﬁ  c toxicity of a given drug or pathological condition at the mitochondrial level, test settings are needed that directly compare the responses and vulnerabilities of mitochondria from different organs. As a prerequisite for such test strategies, we provide here a robust, prompt, and easy-to- follow step-by-step protocol to simultaneously isolate functional and intact mitochondria from rat liver, kidney, heart, and brain. This isolation procedure ensures mitochondrial preparations of comparable purity and reproducible quantities which can be subsequently analyzed for organ-speciﬁ  c mitochondrial toxicity.

demands. However, metabolic differences and metabolite prefer-ences exist in the different healthy tissues of our body [ 1 ]. Whereas brain tissue relies on glucose as the major metabolite, liver, espe-cially in the postresorption phase, relies on fatty acids [ 1 ]. Consistent with these metabolic preferences, marked differences in the molecular composition of the respective mitochondrial popula-tions are known [ 2 – 4 ]. Thus, mitochondria delicately adapt at the molecular level to the metabolic state of their tissue origin.
76Consequently, upon exposure to toxic insults that target  mitochondria, these organelles may respond differently and in an organ- speciﬁ  c fashion. For example, succinate is an important sub-strate for mitochondrial ROS production in brain, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle mitochondria whereas fatty acids generate sig-niﬁ cant quantities of oxidants in kidney and liver mitochondria [ 5 ]. Moreover, liver and brain mitochondria dramatically differ in their response toward calcium challenges [ 6 ] and, importantly, were shown to signiﬁ  cantly differ in their sensitivity toward elicit of the mitochondrial permeability transition, a cell death causing event [ 7 ]. Thus, severe tissue-dependent differences in the mitochon-drial sensitivities toward detrimental impacts exist. In order to investigate such organ-speciﬁ  c mitochondrial differences, test strategies are needed that minimize inter-experimental variability.
Preferably, mitochondria to be compared should be isolated in par-allel on the same day, under appropriate conditions each, and from the same animal in order to subsequently and simultaneously ana-lyze them for their individual susceptibilities.  Here we provide a protocol to isolate mitochondria retaining their metabolic functionality, from the same animal simultaneously and from at least four different rat tissues, namely liver, kidney, heart, and brain. This protocol is a combination of classical isola-tion procedures for mitochondria from individual sources based on differential centrifugation, introduced by Palade’s group [ 8 ] but containing several adaptations according to published methods [ 9 ]. As these “crude” mitochondrial-enriched fractions still con-tain other relevant cellular compartments, particularly peroxisomes and lysosomes, they are subjected to further Percoll™ gradient centrifugation resulting in signiﬁ  cant puriﬁ  cation [ 10 ]. Such puri-
ﬁ ed mitochondria are comparably homogenous but retain their inherent structural peculiarities depending on their tissue origin (Figs.  1  and  2 ). Importantly, these isolated mitochondria present with intact membrane structures as they do not only efﬁ  ciently build up an inner transmembrane potential upon substrate addi-tion (e.g. succinate), but also retain this membrane potential for at least 60 min, highly indicative of preserved functional integrity (Fig.  3 ). Thus, the mitochondrial populations isolated from the same animal appear similar in sample purity and functional integ-rity, being therefore highly suitable for subsequent differential sen-sitivity testing. In total, the isolation procedure takes about 2.5 h ( see   Note 1  ) and the tissue-dependent mitochondrial average yield is given in Table  1 . This protocol may be adapted to isolations of mitochondria from other tissues, e.g. pancreas or spleen for com-
parative purposes ( see   Note 2  ).   Sabine Schulz et al.

Fig. 3    A time stable mitochondrial membrane potential in freshly isolated mitochon-dria conﬁ  rms the functional integrity of their inner membranes. Assessment of the mitochondrial membrane potential was done using the ﬂ  uorescent dye Rhodamine 123 according to published protocols [ 13 ]. ( a ) Due to accumulation within mito-chondria and ﬂ  uorescence quenching of the positively charged dye upon an intact, negative inside membrane potential, a low ﬂ  uorescence is indicative for an existing membrane potential. Upon addition of the protonophor FCCP as internal control, dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential occurs, which can be followed by a steep increase in ﬂ  uorescence. ( b ) As a semi- quantitative measure for the time stable mitochondrial integrity the ﬂ  uorescence ratio before and immediately after FCCP addition is calculated using the time points  t  = 0 (ﬁ  rst enlarged light  grey

Transfer minced liver into a 30 mL Teﬂ  on-glass homogenizer and minced kidney and brain separately into a 15 mL Teﬂ  on- glass homogenizer and ﬁ  ll up the homogenizer with ice cold isolation buffer with 0.1 % BSA to the maximum.      3.    Homogenize the tissue with 5–10 strokes at 800 rpm using the Homogenisator Potter S ( see   Note 8  ).      4.    Transfer homogenized tissue to centrifuge tubes and dilute with ice cold isolation buffer with 0.1 % BSA using a total vol-ume of ~160 mL for liver (4× 50 mL centrifugation tubes), ~40 mL for kidney (1× 50 mL centrifugation tube), and ~28 mL for brain (2× 15 mL centrifugation tubes).      5.

Homogenize heart tissue with ﬁ  ve strokes by hand, carefully rotating the pestle during each stroke. Transfer homogenized heart tissue to a centrifuge tube.      8.    Repeat  steps 3  – 7  until heart tissue is homogenized.      9.    Dilute with ice cold isolation buffer with 0.1 % BSA using a total volume of ~30 mL (2× 15 mL centrifugation tubes).      10.

The pellets obtained by  steps 4   and  5  comprise a crude mito-chondrial fraction. Resuspend this crude liver mitochondria pellet in 4–6 mL and the crude kidney mitochondria pellet in 3.3  Homogenization Procedure ( See   Note 1 )3.3.1  Liver, Kidney, and Brain3.3.2  Heart ( See   Note 9  )3.4  Centrifugation Steps ( See   Note 10 )Sabine Schulz et al.
831 mL. Overlay 1 mL of each of the resuspended pellets on the 18 % phase of a 18/30/60 % Percoll™ gradient, using 4–6 gra-dients for the liver ( see   Note 12  ), and 1 gradient for the kidney. To apply Percoll™ gradient centrifugation to crude heart and brain mitochondria, resuspend each of the crude mitochondria pellets in 4 mL of 18 % gradient layer solution and overlay on the 30 % phase of a 30/60 % Percoll™ gradient.      7.    Centrifuge the liver and kidney Percoll™ gradients at 9,000 ×  g  for 10 min at 4 °C and the brain and heart Percoll™ gradients at 29,000 ×  g  for 10 min at 4 °C.      8.

Transfer the mitochondrial fractions to a fresh centrifugation tube, using two tubes with a maximum capacity of ~50 mL for liver and 1 tube each for kidney, heart, and brain with a maximum capacity of 15 mL.

Discard the supernatants, resuspend the pellets and reﬁ  ll cen-trifugation tubes to maximum capacity with ice cold isolation buffer without BSA. Seal the centrifugation tubes with Paraﬁ  lm ®  and centrifuge liver, kidney, heart, and brain Percoll™ gradient derived fractions at 9,000 ×  g  for 10 min at 4 °C ( see   Note 14  ).

The  arrow   indicates mitochondria gathering at the 30/60 % Percoll™ interphase. Liver and kidney mitochondria appear as prominent bands despite turbid 18 and 30 % Percoll™ phases. Heart and brain
mitochondria gather in a faint but visible band. For the latter Percoll™ gradients appear with whitely clouded more intense 18 and 30 % phases than the actual mitochondria band at the 30/60 % Percoll™ interphase        Isolation of Intact Mitochondria from Rat Liver, Kidney, Heart, and Brain
84   11.    Discard the supernatant and resuspend the mitochondrial  pellet in ice cold isolation buffer without BSA using ~3 mL for liver, ~500 μL for kidney, and 50–300 μL for heart and brain ( see   Note 15  ). Keep the isolated mitochondria on ice for fur-ther investigation ( see   Note 16  ) or freeze at −80 to −178 °C ( see   Note 17  ).       4    Notes      1.    The isolation procedure is ideally performed by two persons, particularly at the homogenization steps. Recommended apportionment: person A homogenizes liver, kidney, and brain, person B takes responsibility for the homogenization of the heart. This is because heart muscle-tissue is homogenized with one additional mincing step and thereafter manually homogenized. The heart homogenization procedure takes approximately the same amount of time as the homogeniza-tion of liver, kidney, and brain together.      2.    Be aware that mitochondria isolation from pancreas or spleen
may require supplementation with protease inhibitors during tissue homogenization in order to retain mitochondrial functionality.      3.    EGTA dissolves only slowly, causing the pH to fall to ~3. Since the supplied amount of EGTA is relatively small, care must be taken to ensure complete solubilization by visual inspection.      4.    Do not re-adjust the pH once the intended pH is exceeded.      5.    The indicated volumes are sufﬁ  cient for up to seven Percoll™ gradients. For the liver 4–6 Percoll™ gradients are needed ( see   Note 12  ), and 1 each for kidney, heart, and brain. Prepare additional gradients if necessary. For heart and brain Percoll™ gradients prepare only a two-phase 30/60 % Percoll™ gradient.      6.    The use of a Peleus ball is critical as the ﬂ  ow rate of a common- use electric pipettor causes the Percoll™-layers to mix.  Alternatively, a syringe can be used. Do not aim to empty the
pipette (or syringe) when releasing 4 mL, as ﬁ  nal emptying may also destroy the Percoll™ layers.      7.    Weighing of organs is recommended to estimate the required number of Percoll™ gradients for the liver ( see   Note 12  ). Further, the organ weight is needed to calculate the obtained mitochondrial protein per mg organ wet weight (cf. Table  1 ).      8.    Tissue homogenization is critical, in the sense of liberating a maximal amount of mitochondria from the cells without destroying them immediately thereafter due to excessive homogenization. Therefore, perform a minimum of strokes, Sabine Schulz et al.
85avoiding strong pressure from the pestle to occur onto the homogenizator bottom. Liver, kidney, and brain tissues are smooth and in our experience, 5–10 strokes lead to a homog-enous result in all occasions. Liver homogenate is more brown-ish and dense than kidney homogenate, which is a little more ginger in color. Brain homogenate is whitely beige. Observation of more reddish homogenates point to remaining blood con-tamination, bearing the risk of oxidative stress and is likely to worsen the functionality of isolated mitochondria.      9.    Tissue homogenization is critical ( see   Note 8  ). To sufﬁ  ciently homogenize the tough heart tissue, ensure the removal of the complete cardiac skeleton, as this ﬁ  brous tissue impedes minc-ing and fails homogenization. The mincing steps must be car-ried out thoroughly as heart tissue pieces greater than 0.5 mm in size also fail homogenization. During homogenization twist
the pestle back and forth, avoiding strong pressure from the pestle to occur onto the homogenizator bottom. Perform a maximum of ﬁ  ve strokes, even if some tissue pieces remain. The homogenization works best if 500 mg tissue is not exceeded.      10.    For an optimal centrifugation procedure, two centrifuges are required.      11.    Be careful when removing the supernatant, as the brain pellet is labile.      12.    Use one Percoll™ gradient for ~2.5 g of liver wet weight. Typically 4–6 Percoll™ gradients are used for the liver.      13.    A mitochondrial band is formed at the 30/60 % Percoll™ interphase. For liver and kidney, these bands are prominent, yet heart and brain mitochondrial bands appear only faint. To harvest the mitochondrial band, dip a Pasteur pipette (3 mL volume) just above the phase boundary, carefully aspirating the interphase. Immediately stop aspiration the moment the ﬁ rst band vanishes. Do not continue aspiration for additional
overlying bands, even if they may appear denser.      14.    Be careful when removing the supernatant, as the pellet may be labile. In this case Percoll™ still resides in the mitochondria pellet, making an additional washing step necessary. Decant as much supernatant as possible without losing the pellet and reﬁ ll the centrifugation tube with ice cold isolation buffer without BSA to maximum capacity and repeat the centrifuga-tion at 9,000 ×  g  for 10 min at 4 °C. Now the brain mitochon-dria pellet should be sufﬁ  ciently stabile to remove the supernatant completely, without pellet detachment.      15.    Resuspension with the speciﬁ  ed volumes will lead to a concen-tration of ~50 μg/μL liver mitochondria, 10–20 μg/μL kid-ney mitochondria, 3–8 μg/μL heart mitochondria, and 1–2 μg/μL brain mitochondria. Do not vortex mitochondria.   Isolation of Intact Mitochondria from Rat Liver, Kidney, Heart, and Brain

This method comprises a semi- automated cell rupture, termed pump controlled cell rupture system (PCC), which can be precisely adjusted to the speciﬁ  c cellular source of isolation and which can be tightly controlled (Schmitt et al., Anal Biochem
443(1):66–74, 2013). Here we provide a detailed hands-on protocol of this PCC method which results in an efﬁ  cient cell breakage but preserving the mitochondrial integrity. Upon subsequent puriﬁ  cation steps, the obtained mitochondrial fraction meets the quality and purity required for molecular analyses, e.g. pro-teomic comparisons, as well as for biochemical analyses, e.g. determination of diverse enzymatic activities.    Key words     Mitochondria  ,   Cell culture  ,   Biopsies  ,   Balch homogenizer  1      Introduction  Mitochondria are the cellular powerhouses and key integrators of cell death decisions    [ 1 ]. Consequently, conditions that impair mito-chondria can lead to severe human diseases. A prime example may be the intoxication of hepatocyte mitochondria by genetically caused excessive copper burdens in Wilson disease [ 2 ,  3 ]. While augmented mitochondria-dependent cell death is a major obstacle in neuro-
degenerative disorders [ 4 ,  5 ], avoidance of cell death is a hallmark of cancer [ 6 ]. Consequently, the identiﬁ  cation of speciﬁ  c mitochon-drial targets to either stabilize or impair their structure or function is a central aim in biomedical research [ 7 ]. Typically, the identiﬁ  cation of such targets is achieved by comparing mitochondria isolated from healthy controls to mitochondria from diseased tissues, by pro-teomics, immuno-blotting or enzymatic measurements, etc. Such analyses may identify molecular and functional mitochondrial altera-tions that can assist in understanding disease progression [ 8 ], or in determining new targets for speciﬁ  c therapeutic intervention [ 9 ], or
88even provide important insights why conventional therapeutic inter-ventions may help in some patients but fail in others [ 10 ].  Such comparative mitochondrial investigations of normal  ver-sus  pathological situations require suspensions of isolated mito-chondria with high and comparable purity. A most critical step in the procedure to isolate mitochondria is the initial step of cell rup-ture. Especially if the starting material is limited, e.g. in cases of cultured cells or tissue biopsies, an efﬁ  cient cell membrane break-age is needed to obtain enough mitochondria for subsequent puri-ﬁ cation steps. However, if this is forcibly approached, a damage of the mitochondrial membranes could occur. Thus, cell rupture or tissue homogenization conditions have to be balanced between efﬁ cient plasma membrane rupture and consequent mitochondrial yield and mitochondrial integrity. To this end, means are needed
that can be precisely adjusted to the respective source of isolation. We recently reported [ 11 ] that this can be accomplished using the “pump controlled cell rupture system” (PCC). PCC consists of a current version of the “Balch-homogenizer” (Isobiotec, Germany) [ 12 ] coupled to a high precision pump. Within the “Balch-homogenizer,” the cells or the tissue have to pass an exactly adjust-able clearance (Fig.  1 ). This allows for deﬁ  ning and controlling the shear forces, which affect the cells and the mitochondria in the course of the homogenization process. The high precision pump further increases the reproducibility and controllability of the over-all homogenization process.   In order to further extend the practical value of this method, with a special focus on potential experimental pitfalls, we provide here an easy-to-follow protocol for the use of PCC and down-stream centrifugation steps to isolate mitochondria from cultured
cells and minute tissue samples (Fig.  2 ). Taken together, the herein described protocol reproducibly yields isolated mitochondria from cultured cells or minute tissue samples that meet the quality and purity required for molecular as well as for functional analyses.   2    Materials  Prepare all solutions using ultrapure water (Prepared by purifying deionized water to attain a resistivity of 18.2 M Ω-cm at 25 °C).       1.

Transfer the buffer to a 1 L measuring cylin-der, ﬁ  ll it up to 1,000 ml with water and store at 4 °C. The buffer can be used for 1 week.        Fig. 1    Cartoon of the pump controlled cell rupture system (PCC). A high precision pump ( 1 ) ensures, via gastight syringes ( 2 ), the continuous sample delivery ( 3 ) in a constant rate to the “Balch-homogenizer” ( 4 ). Cell breakage occurs upon passage through a deﬁ  ned clearance ( square  ), which is adjusted by selecting tungsten car-bide balls of different diameters ( 5 ). The cell homogenate is collected in a second syringe ( 6 ) and can be re-subjected to the homogenizer, which is thermally equili-brated by a cooling plate ( 7 ). In this protocol, the syringe that initially contains the
sample (cell suspension or tissue pieces) is referred to as syringe B and the second syringe is referred to as syringe A.

Keep on ice until starting the homogenization.       2.    For mitochondria isolation from cell culture, harvest the cells and determine the cell concentration and viability ( see   Note 6  ).

93   7.    Repeat  steps 4   and  5  or  4  and  6  until all of the cells or tissue are/is homogenized ( see   Note 14  ).      8.    Centrifuge the homogenate for 5 or 10 min (cells or tissue, respectively) at 800 ×  g  at 4 °C.      9.    Transfer the supernatant to a fresh 2.0 ml tube and centrifuge it for 10 min at 9,000 ×  g  at 4 °C.      10.    Carefully discard the supernatant, slowly resuspend the pellets (crude mitochondrial fraction) in 30 μl isolation buffer. If working with multiples of 5 × 10 6  cells, you may pool the obtained crude mitochondrial fractions now.      11.    Determine the protein concentration of the crude mitochon-drial fraction. This is necessary to determine the number of Nycodenz ®  density gradients needed for further puriﬁ  cation.      12.    After the isolation, rinse the syringes 3–4 times with ddH 2 O. Clean the used tungsten carbide ball and the cell homogenizer with isopropanol and rinse them subsequently
with ddH 2 O. Dry the tungsten carbide ball thoroughly.            1.    Prepare the Nycodenz ®  density gradient. Add 500 μl 18 % Nycodenz ®  to a 5 ml centrifuge tube (Thinwall, Ultra-Clear™, Beckman Coulter, USA). Slowly syringe 300 μl of 24 or 33 % Nycodenz ®  (for cultured cells or liver tissue, respectively) below the 18 % layer ( see   Note 15  ).      2.    Load 650–950 μg of the crude mitochondrial fraction on the discontinuous Nycodenz ®  density gradient ( see   Note 16  ) and centrifuge it for 15 min in an ultracentrifuge at    ca. 110,000 ×  g  (swing out rotor SW55Ti, Beckman Coulter, USA) at 4 °C.      3.    Collect the mitochondria from the phase boundary (24 %/18 % or 33 %/24 % for cell culture mitochondria or rat liver tissue mitochondria, respectively) ( see   Note 17  ). Transfer the puri-ﬁ ed mitochondria into a fresh 2.0 ml tube and adjust to 2 ml with isolation buffer. Centrifuge for 10 min at 9,000 ×  g  (4 °C) to remove Nycodenz ®  remnants.
to remove Nycodenz ®  remnants.      4.    Discard the supernatant and carefully resuspend the pellet in 30 μl isolation buffer. Puriﬁ  ed mitochondria typically yield 20 % in mg protein of the starting amount of the crude mito-chondrial isolates subjected to the Nycodenz ®  density gradient.      5.    The puriﬁ  ed mitochondrial fraction may now be subjected to molecular or biochemical analyses (Fig.  3  and table  1 ). For example upon addition of respiratory substrate (e.g. succinate) intact mitochondrial preparations should build up a mem-brane potential that remains stable for at least 1 h [ 11 ,  13 ].        3.2  Puriﬁ  cation of the Crude Mitochondrial Fraction by Nycodenz ®  Density Gradient CentrifugationSemi-Automated Method to Isolate Mitochondria
944    Notes      1.    We do not recommend using plastic syringes due to their lack of stability. In our hands, best results were obtained with syringes from the given supplier.      2.    This syringe pump model can be precisely adjusted and with-stands the back-pressure that emerges during the homogeni-zation process.      3.    The manual metal-lift table can thereby assist the cooling of the cell homogenizer during the homogenization process. Two manual lift tables should be at hand if more than 25 × 10 6  cells will be homogenized. Exchanging against a pre-cooled lift table every 30 min assists in effective cooling throughout the homogenization process.

95   4.    We determined a clearance of 6 or 10 μm to be successful for mitochondrial isolations from the tested cell lines given in Table  1  in terms of yield and mitochondrial integrity. We therefore recommend such initial settings which may, how-ever, be further optimized. A clearance of 4 μm is not recom-mended as it impaired mitochondrial functionality. For liver tissue, a clearance smaller than 18 μm resulted in a congestion of the cell homogenizer.      5.    Ensure that the system is air bubble free, as they alter the shear forces during the homogenization. Even though clearances of 6 or 8 μm already cause a noticeable back-pressure, one should be able to manually pump buffer through the cell homoge-nizer. If a strong resistance of the buffer ﬂ  ow via the PCC chamber can be encountered in such pre-isolation tests, remove the tungsten carbide ball, rinse the cell homogenizer thoroughly with isopropanol and ultrapure water and assem-
ble the system again as described in  step 1   of Subheading  3.1 .      6.    We typically use cell suspensions with more than 80 % viability. A lower viability might be accompanied by an impairment of mitochondrial structure or function, complicating subsequent isolation.      7.    5 × 10 6  cells yield crude mitochondria of at least 60 μg in the cell lines tested so far (Table  1 ). Less than 3 × 10 6  or more than 10 × 10 10  cells per ml decreased either the absolute or the rela-tive yield of isolated mitochondria, respectively.      8.    The weight of tissue is required to calculate how much isola-tion buffer has to be added to reach a concentration of 30–40 mg tissue per ml.      9.    A higher concentration overloads the system. Lower concen-trations decrease the relative yield and increase the time expen-diture of the homogenization. As the functional and structural stability of isolated mitochondria is time-dependent, it is advis-
able to minimize the endurance of the whole isolation process as much as possible.      10.    The number of strokes needed to homogenize the cells depends on the respective cell line (Table  1 ). One “stroke” represents a passage from syringe B (i.e. the syringe that  initially contains the sample) to syringe A, and vice versa. For most cell lines, less than three strokes were insufﬁ  cient to break the cell membrane, whereas more than six strokes impaired mitochondrial functionality or structural integrity. For rat liver tissue, we found that more than one stroke did not markedly increase the mitochondrial yield.      11.    The volume within the cell homogenizer approximately accounts for 500 μl. Therefore, it is important to rinse the system once with isolation buffer to recover the whole homogenate and to Semi-Automated Method to Isolate Mitochondria
96avoid residual contaminants in the cell homogenizer. If subse-quently, mitochondria from other sources shall be isolated, we recommend at least 3–4 cleaning passages of fresh isolation buffer each. Alternatively, the whole homogenization unit may be disassembled, cleaned, and reassembled again before continuing.      12.    Some small pieces of the liver tissue may enter the cell homog-enizer, but not pass the clearance. We therefore recommend that the second stroke starts with the syringe used for the ﬁ  rst stroke (syringe B). Tissue pieces that remained within the cell homogenizer can now pass the clearance with this second stroke, thereby increasing the yield without re-stressing already isolated mitochondria.      13.    In order to control the number of passages for the single pieces of tissue, the system unit needs to be cleared from remaining tissue pieces before starting with the next 30–40 mg of tissue to be processed.
14.    Subsequent separation of mitochondria from unbroken cells/nuclei in a ﬁ  rst centrifugation step at 800 ×  g  is less efﬁ  cient if the homogenate is kept on ice for more than 45 min. A plau-sible explanation may be a progressive clotting of mitochon-dria, nuclei, and cell debris over time resulting in marked mitochondrial loss in the 800 ×  g  pellet. Thus, in the case of multiple isolations subsequent centrifugation steps should not start later than 30–40 min after the initial homogenization.      15.    In order to avoid phase intermixing of the Nycodenz ®  density step gradient we recommend slowly layering the 300 μl of 24 or 33 % Nycodenz ®  (for cultured cells or liver tissue, respec-tively) with a syringe below the 18 % Nycodenz ® . The phase boundary is slightly visible for the 18 %/24 % and clearly visi-ble for the 18 %/33 % gradient.      16.    If less than 650 μg of the crude mitochondrial fraction are loaded on the Nycodenz
loaded on the Nycodenz ®  gradient, the mitochondrial inter-phase might be barely visible, overloading (more than 950 μg of the crude mitochondrial fraction) may impair the puriﬁ  ca-tion efﬁ  ciency.      17.    To collect the mitochondria, slowly lower a pipette mounted with a 200 μl tip just above the phase boundary, carefully aspi-rating the interphase. Immediately stop aspiration, the moment as the mitochondrial band vanishes.           Acknowledgement  We would like to acknowledge E.E. Rojo and A. Simmons for critical reading of the manuscript.

One approach that makes the detection of rare species possible is the treatment of biological samples with solid-phase combinatorial peptide ligand libraries, ProteoMiner. This method utilizes hexa-peptide bead library with huge diversity to bind and enrich low-abundance proteins but remove most of the high-abundance proteins, therefore compresses the protein abundance range in the samples. This work
describes optimized protocols and highlights on the successful application of ProteoMiner to protein identiﬁ  cation and analysis.

For example, 99 % of the pro-tein content in plasma and serum samples is only about 20 high-abundance proteins, whereas the other thousands of proteins are less than 1 % of the plasma or serum proteome [ 1 ,  2 ]. After decades of research and accumulated knowledge on high- abundance pro-teins due to their relatively easy access, the discovery and analysis of the rare species in proteomes attracts more and more attentions.  ProteoMiner technology is based on a combinatorial hexapeptide library bound to chromatographic beads [ 3 – 6 ]. It can be used to
decrease levels of high-abundance proteins for researchers to enrich and detect more mid- to low-abundance proteins in complex samples and unveil the proteomes deeply and comprehensively. When a complex biological sample is added to the beads, proteins bind to their speciﬁ  c ligands through combination of  various types of interactions including ionic interaction, hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding and van
100der Waal’s force, so high- abundance proteins saturate their speciﬁ  c ligands and the excess proteins are washed away. In contrast, medium- and low- abundance proteins not saturating their speciﬁ  c ligands will mostly stay bound to their peptide ligands and are therefore enriched relatively to the high-abundance proteins during the process (Fig.  1 ). The result is a reduction in the dynamic range which allows for the detection of medium- and low-abundance proteins.   The ProteoMiner technology has been extensively applied to variety of sample types [ 6 ] including plasma and serum [ 3 ], urine [ 7 ], bile [ 8 ], platelets [ 9 ], red blood cell extract [ 10 ,  11 ], egg white extract [ 12 ], egg yolk extract [ 13 ], CSF [ 14 ], saliva [ 15 ,  16 ], venom [ 17 ], milk whey fraction [ 18 ,  19 ], sea urchin coelomic ﬂ uid [ 20 ], plant leaf [ 21 ], seeds [ 22 ], peel and pulp [ 23 ], phloem exudates [ 24 ,  25 ], plant latex [ 26 ], bacteria [ 3 ], and even beverage
and wine [ 27 ,  28 ]. The ProteoMiner beads have also been success-fully used on detection, identiﬁ  cation, adsorption, and removal of impurities or host cell proteins from puriﬁ  ed proteins [ 29 ,  30 ].  Even though ProteoMiner beads have a large diversity of  hexapeptides, the analysis in different groups [ 31 ,  32 ] using two- dimensional gel electrophoresis, immunoassay and mass spectrom-etry, indicated a high level of consistency from sample to sample when processed with similar and variable bead volumes.

101 This chapter describes the standard protocol optimized for plasma and serum samples to compress proteomic dynamic range. Results with other sample types will vary depending on the amount of protein in the samples as well as the dynamic range that each sample type contains. The ratio of protein to beads is crucial for optimal performance of ProteoMiner kits, so best results will be obtained by optimization of ratio of proteins to ProteoMiner beads for each individual sample type. With increasing amount of serum sample loaded onto same amount of ProteoMiner beads, some proteins can be enriched more than the others (Fig.  2 ).   2     Materials      1.

The bold and italic volumes in parenthesis are for the ProteoMiner Small Capacity Kits.    Vacuum at about 16 mmHg can replace centrifugation for column preparation, sample binding, and sample wash steps if desired.    1.    First remove the top cap and then snap off the bottom cap from
each of the ProteoMiner spin columns you will be using. Keep both top and bottom caps for usage throughout the protocol. If beads settle in top cap, replace after removing bottom plug and centrifuge with top cap on column. To use bottom cap as a plug, invert and ﬁ  rmly place to bottom of spin column.      2.    Place the column in a collection tube and centrifuge at 1,000 ×  g  for 30–60 s to remove the storage solution.      3.    Replace the bottom cap and add 600 μl (200 μl) of wash buf-fer, then replace top cap. Invert column end-to-end several times over a 5 min period.      4.    Remove bottom cap, place the column in a collection tube and centrifuge at 1,000 ×  g  for 30–60 s to remove the wash buffer.      5.    Repeat  steps 3   and  4  one more time.        Samples should be free of precipitate. If needed, centrifuge samples at 10,000 ×  g  for 10 min to clarify or pretreat the samples to remove incompatible or interfering materials ( see   Note 2  ).
Replace bottom cap and add sample to column, for example 1 ml ( 200 μl) of serum or plasma. Replace top cap and invert col-umn end-to-end on a platform or rotational shaker for 2 h at room temperature ( see   Note 3  ).  3.1  Column Preparation and Equilibration3.2  Sample Binding ( See   Note 1 )Lei Li

Repeat  steps 2   and  3  three more times.             1.    After all wash buffers have been removed, replace the bottom and bottom caps and add 600 μl (200 μl) deionized water. Attach top cap and invert end-to-end for 1 min.      2.    Remove caps, place column in a collection tube and centrifuge at 1,000 ×  g  for 30–60 s to remove water.       If using vacuum up to this point, you will now need to switch to centrifugation  .    3.    Attach bottom cap to the column (take caution to ensure the bottom cap is tightly attached). Add 100 μl (20 μl) of rehy-
drated elution reagent to the column and replace top cap. Lightly vortex for 5 s ( see   Note 4  ).      4.    Incubate column at room temperature, lightly vortex several times over a period of 15 min.      5.    Remove caps, place in a clean collection tube and centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 30–60 s. This elution contains your eluted proteins.      6.    Repeat  steps 5  – 7  two more times.      7.    Store elution at −20 °C or proceed with downstream analysis. For some downstream applications, we recommend a clean-up of your sample prior to analysis.  See  Subheading  3.6  below for the protocol in details.             1.    Carefully add 200 μl wash buffer on top cap and all sides of the column to ensure none of the beads are stuck to the cap and sides of the column.      2.    Centrifuge at 1,000 ×  g  for 30–60 s. Discard collected material.       If using vacuum up to this point, you will now need to switch to centrifugation  .

Remove bottom cap, place column in a collection tube and  centrifuge at 1,000 ×  g  for 30–60 s to collect the elution. This  elution contains your eluted proteins.      5.

Some downstream applications of the ProteoMiner-treated elu-tions may require to remove incompatible reagents. Below is an easy and convenient method using the Micro Bio-Spin P-6 gel col-umn for buffer exchanging the ProteoMiner eluates with compat-ible reagents.    1.    Invert the column several times to resuspend the settled gel and remove any bubbles.      2.    Snap off the tip and place column in a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube. Remove cap. Allow the excess packing buffer to drain by gravity to top of gel bed. (If column does not begin to ﬂ  ow, push cap back into column and remove.) Discard the buffer.      3.    Place the column back into the 2 ml tube. Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 ×  g  to remove the packing buffer.      4.    Block the bottom of the Bio-Spin 6 column with the tip and
add 500 μl of the downstream application compatible buffer (for example, the Exchange buffer in Subheading  2 ). Invert the column several times to resuspend the settled gel.      5.    Remove the bottom tip and place the column in a clean 2 ml microcentrifuge tube. Remove cap. Allow the excess packing buffer to drain by gravity to top of gel bed. Discard the buffer.      6.    Place the column back into the 2 ml tube. Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 ×  g  to remove the buffer.      7.    Repeat  steps 4  – 6  two more times.      8.    Place the column in a clean 2 ml microcentrifuge tube. Carefully apply up to 50 μl of ProteoMiner eluates to the col-umn and centrifuge for 2 min at 1,000 ×  g . The collected solu-tion is buffer-exchanged to the compatible reagents.       4    Notes      1.    As listed examples in the introduction, variety of sample types from different species and sources have been used successfully
with the ProteoMiner beads. In principle, the more proteins are incubated with the ProteoMiner beads, the more degree of dynamic range compression can be reached, whereas extremely low abundant proteins can be much enriched compared to the high abundant proteins. As a guideline, 50 mg of serum or plasma proteins are recommended for 100 μl ProteoMiner beads. In return, a bit more than 1 mg of proteins can be bound to and eluted from the beads, so that up to 50-fold dynamic range compression can be obtained. Depending on the needs and goals of the speciﬁ  c research, it would be wise to keep in 3.6  Elution Clean-Up with Micro Bio-Spin columnsLei Li
105mind of this while designing the experiment and deciding the ratio between sample and ProteoMiner beads. Much higher sample to beads ratio has been tested (Fig.  2 ) with still increasing enrichment of a few proteins. Regular buffers based on phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or Tris buffered saline (TBS) with or without mild detergents in samples are recommended for the ProteoMiner beads because of their less interference with binding of proteins to ProteoMiner peptides    ( see   Notes 2  – 4  below in more details).      2.    Biological samples often contain interfering or incompatible materials other than proteins which researchers are interested in. It is crucial to remove them before applying samples onto ProteoMiner beads. Dialysis, gel ﬁ  ltration, centrifugation and protein precipitation are a few examples of pretreatment meth-ods, and can be selected according to the sample types and sizes, protein concentrations, and downstream applications.
The quality of the samples before ProteoMiner treatment can be simply analyzed by gel electrophoresis or a UV/Vis spec-trophotometer. The ProteoMiner process can be viewed as afﬁ nity puriﬁ  cation with complex protein–peptide interac-tions. Interfering materials and incompatible solutions for regular protein afﬁ  nity puriﬁ  cation will have some effects on binding of certain proteins to their speciﬁ  c peptide ligands. Buffer compatibility for wash and elution steps can often refer afﬁ nity puriﬁ  cation guidance and principles.      3.    It is recommended to optimize the sample to beads ratio in order to achieve the desired performance. Higher sample to beads ratio tends to enrich more mid- to low-abundant pro teins (Fig.  2 ). If the protein concentration is low in the samples, concentrating may be needed. Otherwise, the equilibrated ProteoMiner beads can be taken out of the column and incubated with samples in
another tube. After sample binding is done, the beads can be spun down and transferred back into the column for wash and elution. The sample binding incubation time and temperature in this step are the recommendations for plasma and serum samples. Incubation at 4 °C overnight would be another way researchers can often use for their speciﬁ  c samples. If using plasma, clump-ing may occur after 1 h of binding; this is expected and will not negatively impact the sample preparation. Heparinized plasma is not compatible with this kit.      4.    For 2-D users who plan to use the ProteoMiner treated sam-ples on DIGE, this elution reagent will require clean up and pH adjustment. As an alternative you may elute with DIGE buffer. However, this may result in a decreased yield and num-ber of protein spots. For a more complete elution if it would not interfere with downstream applications, the Laemmli s ample buffer with 1 % SDS and reducing agents like
β-Mercaptoethanol or DTT can be added and incubated with ProteoMiner beads at 95 °C for 5 min before elution.         Principles and Examples of ProteoMiner

However, during the formalin ﬁ  xation proteins undergo degradation and cross-linking, making conventional protein analysis technologies challenging. Cross-linking is even more challenging when quantitative proteome analysis of FFPE tissue is planned. The use of conventional protein labeling technologies on FFPE tissue has turned out to be problematic as the
lysine residue labeling targets are frequently blocked by the formalin treatment. We have established a qualitative and quantitative proteomics analysis technique for FFPE tissues that combines label-free pro-teomic analysis with optimized protein extraction and separation conditions.

Clinical archives frequently combine stored FFPE samples with data on diagnosis and outcome. Such samples hold unique information on biological path-ways and cellular processes leading to disease, but suitable molecular technologies are required to access the information [ 1 – 3 ].
For a long time, quantitative proteomic studies on archival mate-rial have been considered to be an almost impossible task, primarily due to the harsh and irreversible procedures needed for ﬁ  xation and the loss of macromolecular integrity during prolonged storage. The changes occurring during cross-linking of proteins during the ﬁ  xation of FFPE tissue have been investigated in different studies [ 4 – 6 ]. The consensus is that the major consequence of formaldehyde ﬁ  xation is the generation of a methylol modiﬁ  cation at free lysine residues [ 4 ,  7 ]. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate different components
110used for protein extraction, including buffer components, detergents, pH, temperature, and pressure [ 4 ,  8 – 10 ].  Most chemical labels used in quantitative proteomics target lysine residues, leading to inefﬁ  cient labeling of FFPE material where lysine is no longer available [ 11 – 13 ]. Recently, label-free approaches have been proposed as an alternative for quantiﬁ  cation of proteome proﬁ  les from FFPE samples [ 14 ,  15 ].  Here, we provide a tested methodological protocol suitable for the quantitative and qualitative proteomic analysis of archival tissue combining optimal protein extraction and separation with gel- based proteomics [ 4 ]. We successfully used this method to study the FFPE archived cardiac tissue from sham- and total body- irradiated C57BL/6 mice [ 4 ,  16 ]. For quantitative proteome anal-ysis, we used label-free approach [ 17 ] to detect putative molecular biomarkers of ionizing radiation.
biomarkers of ionizing radiation.  This methodology can be transferred to other tissues and treat-ments. The protocol will facilitate the development of future pro-teomic analysis techniques for FFPE tissue and provide a tool for the validation in archival samples of biomarkers of exposure, prog-nosis, and disease.  2    Materials  All solutions are prepared using HPLC grade water.

Place FFPE tissue sections (20 μm thick, 80 mm 2  wide) on microscope slides and deparafﬁ  nize by incubating twice with xylene for 10 min at room temperature before rehydration in a graded series of ethanol (100, 95, and 70 %) for 10 min each.      3.    Scrap the tissue sections from the slides and transfer to a reac-tion cup ( see   Note 1  ).      4.    Wash the tissue sections with wash buffer described in Subheading  2.1  for 15 min at room temperature with slight shaking.      5.    Incubate all samples in lysis buffer at 100 °C for 20 min, and then at 80 °C for 2 h with shaking ( see   Note 2  ).      6.    Centrifuge the extracts for 30 min at 14,000 ×  g  at 4 °C.      7.

112   9.    Dissolve protein pellet ( see   step 7  ) with 1× Laemmli buffer at a concentration of 1–5 μg/μL.            1.    Load sample wells of the 4–12 % SDS-PAGE gel with protein solution and separate equal amounts (50–100 μg protein per lane) [ 18 ] ( see   Note 6  ).      2.    Fill electrophoresis chamber with SDS-PAGE running buffer. Run electrophoresis gels at 90 V for the ﬁ  rst ~15 min at room temperature (until the blue dye moved out of the stacking gel). Thereafter, increase voltage to 120 V.      3.    After electrophoresis incubate 1D PAGE gels with Colloidal Coomassie solution overnight on a shaker at 4 °C.      4.    Destain the gels with water and transfer to a clean container and store in water at 4 °C until further analysis.        For the identiﬁ  cation and quantiﬁ  cation of proteins, slice each SDS-PAGE lane horizontally into ﬁ  ve pieces. Digest proteins into peptides prior to mass spectrometry analysis as follows:
1.    Destain the gel pieces further and rinse with buffer containing 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3  in 30 % acetonitrile (ACN) (v/w), pH 8.0.      2.    Equilibrate the gel pieces in 10 mM NH 4 HCO 3 , pH 8.0, prior to proteolytic digestion by shrinking them in 100 % ACN and rehydrating in 10 mM NH 4 HCO 3 .      3.    Add 0.1–0.2 μg of trypsin per gel piece and incubate over-night at 37 °C ( see   Note 7  ).      4.    Elute the digested proteins using 80 % (v/v) ACN, 1 % (v/v) triﬂ uoroacetic acid (TFA).      5.    Dry the eluates in a SpeedVac centrifuge.      6.    Resuspend the dried samples in 20 μl 5 % (v/v) ACN, 0.5 % (v/v) TFA for subsequent high-performance liquid chroma-tography (HPLC) separation and ESI-MS/MS analysis ( see   Notes 8  – 10 ).        Due to the protein cross-linking during FFPE preparation, con-ventional labeling approach cannot be used for quantitative pro-teomic analysis on FFPE tissue. Formaldehyde, used in tissue
ﬁ xation, leads to a 30 Da (methylol) modiﬁ  cation mainly on lysine residues and inhibits classical labeling methodology that is targeted to lysine residues. Alternatively, FFPE proteome proﬁ  le has been recently quantiﬁ  ed using non-labeling approaches. For label-free proteomics, the acquired spectra should be identiﬁ  ed and quanti-ﬁ ed using the Progenesis software [ 16 ,  17 ] ( see   Note 11  ). To interpret the observed alterations in proteome, the signiﬁ  cantly differentially expressed proteins in all samples should be analyzed using bioinformatics tools such as PANTHER or DAVID [ 19 ,  20 ]. Classify the proteins using Gene ontology (GO) categories [ 21 ]. 3.2  SDS-PAGE and Protein Staining3.3  Processing of Gel-Resolved Proteins and Tryptic Digestion3.4  An Example of Label-Free Proteomics on FFPE SampleOmid Azimzadeh et al.
113 The described methodology has been used to study the FFPE archived cardiac tissue from sham- and total body-irradiated C57BL/6 mice [ 4 ,  16 ]. The samples were analyzed using label- free approach to detect putative molecular biomarkers of ionizing radiation. The differentially expressed proteins were classiﬁ  ed using GO categories (cellular components, molecular function, and bio-logical processes). Differentially expressed proteins grouped according to molecular functions are shown in Fig.  1 . In our case, proteins with oxidoreductase activity represented the largest group. The GO analysis of biological processes indicated that the deregu-lated proteins were mainly involved in lipid, carbohydrate, phos-phate and nucleic acid metabolism as well as molecular transport (Fig.  1b ). The GO cellular compartment analysis showed that most deregulated proteins belonged to the mitochondrial proteome. Functional annotation clustering analysis using the DAVID soft-
ware showed that the proteins belonged to different mitochondrial compartments such as membranes, electron transport machinery, matrix, and channels (Fig.  1c ). Furthermore, radiation-induced   Fig. 1    Radiation-induced alteration of the cardiac mitochondrial proteome. Signiﬁ  cantly differentially regulated proteins were classiﬁ  ed for GO categories “Molecular function” ( a ), “Biological process” ( b ), and “Cellular compartment” ( c ) using the PANTHER and DAVID bioinformatics tools. The amount of deregulated proteins is indicated as a number of the total amount of up- or down-regulated proteins at 24 h. The analysis indicated that ionizing radiation caused impairment of mitochondrial structure and function        FFPE Qualitative and Quantitative Proteomics

To avoid keratin contamination, always wear gloves and cover the hair during handling samples and gels.      2.    To minimize proteolysis of the protein lysates, it is recom-mended to use protease inhibitors and keep the samples on ice.      3.    During precipitation, do not overdry the pellet after removal of the acetone as this might lead to difﬁ  culty in resolubiliza-tion of the pellet in the resuspension buffer.      4.    If you have problems in determining the protein concentra-tion of the lysate, it may be due to some component in the lysis buffer. In this case try another protein quantiﬁ  cation method.      5.    If the protein yield after resolubilization is low, test other solu-bilization buffers as the result may differ with the types of tis-
sues used. For more information,  see  the protocols mentioned in ref.  6 .      6.    Use ultrapure proteomics grade reagents to prepare buffers for staining and digestion.      7.

In order to make these tissues available for protein biomarker discovery and validation studies, dedicated sample preparation procedures overcoming the intermolecular cross-links introduced by formalin need to be implemented. This chapter describes a full-length protein extraction protocol optimized for downstream gel-based proteomics applications.
Using the procedures detailed here, SDS-PAGE, western immunoblotting, GeLC-MS/MS, 2D-PAGE, and 2D-DIGE can be carried out on FFPE tissues. Technical tips, critical aspects, and drawbacks of the method are presented and discussed.

Once the diagnostic process is completed, the residual tissues are stored in long-term repositories. Clearly, these archives possess a huge potential for retrospective tissue proteomics studies, thanks to their matched datasets on the patient clinical records including diagno-sis, disease progression, and response to therapy. In addition, when
considering the restrictions due to signiﬁ  cant ethical issues, logistic complexity, or poor availability of rare disease samples, that are connected with the recovery of sufﬁ  cient numbers of high-quality, well-characterized fresh tissues, archived FFPE tissues become an especially valuable resource [ 1 ,  2 ].
118 Nevertheless, the formalin ﬁ  xation chemistry introduces stable intermolecular cross-links within the tissue. As a consequence, until less than a decade ago it was practically impossible to access proteomic information of FFPE tissues. In the latest years, and with varying degrees of success, several research groups have worked at the development of methods aimed to solve this prob-lem, leading to the devisal of strategies that fall into two main approaches: digestion of the whole cross-linked protein matrix into peptides, or extraction of full-length proteins by the combined action of physical and chemical factors [ 3 – 5 ]. Typically, direct tryptic digestion strategies generate products that are ideally suit-able to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC- MS/MS) analysis, followed by various bioinformatic pipelines for data parsing and interpretation (shotgun proteomics) [ 6 ,  7 ]. Notwithstanding the elevated performances of shotgun proteomics
in terms of information depth and data robustness, the ability to obtain full-length proteins can still offer its own advantages, by enabling the application of a wider range of downstream analytical approaches, including separation by gel electrophoresis [ 8 – 10 ]. Each electrophoresis-based method bears its own speciﬁ  c advan-tages, but all share the added informational value of preserving information on molecular weight or charge of the protein. Among 1D-based approaches, the potential of making FFPE extracts avail-able to SDS-PAGE and western immunoblotting is clearly evident and unquestioned. Despite the outstanding technical progresses made in the proteomics ﬁ  eld, western immunoblotting still remains the gold standard for large-scale protein expression validation, due to its technical reliability combined with the relative ease of execu-tion and the low cost of instrumentation and reagents. SDS-PAGE
separation of FFPE extracts can also be followed by band cutting, in-gel digestion and MS/MS identiﬁ  cation (GeLC-MS/MS), in an alternative to the shotgun proteomics approach. The advan-tages of GeLC-MS/MS are the ability to process extracts directly without sample cleanup, the direct visualization of the approxi-mate amount and quality of proteins being processed, the mainte-nance of molecular weight information, as well as the ability to carry out data analysis by using merged information or only infor-mation on molecular weight areas of interest [ 11 ].  In addition to 1D separations, 2D-PAGE approaches, includ-ing the 2D-DIGE technology, can also be implemented on FFPE tissue extracts upon removal of non-compatible extraction reagents. Notwithstanding the tremendous rise and potential of shotgun proteomics approaches, 2D-PAGE is still one of the workhorses of differential proteomics, being accessible, relatively easy to imple-
ment, and not strictly dependent from the use of high-performance mass spectrometry instrumentation or data processing capabilities. This widespread technique can provide information on the global patterns of protein expression, enabling the quantitative and Alessandro Tanca et al.
119qualitative study of all proteins in relation to each other without  requiring their previous identiﬁ  cation, with the added advantage of visualizing proteoforms of different charges or molecular masses [ 12 ]. On the other hand, 2D-PAGE has well-known limitations, including poor reproducibility, low sensitivity, and narrow linear dynamic ranges, but these can be overcome by implementation of the 2D-DIGE, that entails the use of ﬂ  uorescent stains, powerful imaging instrumentation, and ad-hoc experimental design approaches, providing a considerable increase in reproducibility, sensitivity, robustness, and linear dynamic range [ 13 ,  14 ].  The protocol described in this chapter enables extraction of full-length proteins from FFPE tissues building on the “antigen retrieval” concept, described in a seminal work by Shi et al., and elaborated in several variants by different research groups [ 15 ,  16 ].
Here, protein extraction relies on exposure of ﬁ  xed proteins to combined physical agitation, heat, detergents and reducing agents, in a buffered environment (Fig.  1a ). The extracts generated by this protocol are readily suitable to protein quantitation and SDS- PAGE separation, followed either by transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes for probing with antibodies, or to in-gel digestion and MS identiﬁ  cation. In order to enable 2D-PAGE separation, the ionic detergents used for extraction are exchanged with other reagents suitable to isoelectric focusing of proteins.

120Once cleared by these interfering substances, proteins can also be subjected to cyanine labeling before separation and undergo the more reliable and robust 2D DIGE workﬂ  ow (Fig.  1b ).   The successful implementation of this protocol enables the insertion of FFPE tissue extracts into already established proteomic analysis pipelines. However, it should always be kept in mind that, although extraction and analysis procedures have now reached sat-isfactory quality levels, FFPE patterns are still not totally compa-rable to those generated using fresh-frozen tissues. Slight differences do in fact remain concerning high molecular weight and basic proteins. Furthermore, issues such as length of ﬁ  xation time and tissue cellularity can impact on quality and complexity of the protein pattern, as discussed and detailed previously in several dedicated works [ 17 – 19 ]. In conclusion, when high-quality, fresh
tissues are not readily available or practical, the application of the described protocols opens the valuable possibility to exploit the FFPE tissue archive resource for proteomics studies.  2    Materials  All protocols require the use of a microcentrifuge and of 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.

Equilibrate sponges, 3MM paper sheets, polyacrylamide gel (containing the separated protein sample) and nitrocellulose membrane by soaking them for a few seconds in transfer buffer.      6.    Assemble a “sandwich” composed by: sponge, two 3MM paper sheets, polyacrylamide gel, nitrocellulose membrane, two 3MM paper sheets, sponge (from the black cathode to the red anode).      7.    Put the sandwich into the transfer apparatus, along with a pre- frozen freezer pack and a stir bar.      8.

Stain the gel with a Coomassie-based dye (e.g. three sequen-tial 1 min microwave incubations in deionized water followed by a 45 s microwave incubation with the staining solution if using the SimplyBlue SafeStain staining).      3.    Put the stained gel on a clean glass.      4.    Fractionate the entire lane(s) in 15–30 slices using a clean scal-pel, and transfer each slice into a clean tube ( see   Note 26  ).      5.    Shrink gel slices by adding ACN (up to completely cover the
gel piece) and incubating for 10 min at RT (gel pieces become opaque and stick together).      6.    Completely remove ACN, add the reducing solution up to completely cover gel pieces and incubate for 45 min at 56 °C ( see   Note 5  ).      7.

126   9.    Completely remove ACN, add the alkylating solution up to completely cover gel pieces and incubate for 30 min at RT in the dark.      10.    Remove the remaining solution, add ACN up to completely cover gel pieces and incubate for 10 min.      11.    Completely remove ACN.      12.    If gel pieces are not completely destained (blue is still visible) add 50 mM ABC and incubate at RT for 10 min, then shrink with ACN for 10 min (repeat sequentially until gel pieces are destained); otherwise, skip to the following step ( see   Note 27  ).      13.    Dissolve trypsin in ABC in order to reach a 10 ng/ μl working solution.      14.    Add 10 μl of trypsin working solution to the dry gel pieces and leave them in an ice bucket or at 4 °C for 60–120 min.      15.    Remove excess of trypsin solution, then add ABC up to com-pletely cover gel pieces.      16.    Place tubes with gel pieces into an air circulation thermostat and incubate overnight at 37 °C.
and incubate overnight at 37 °C.      17.    Chill tubes to RT, spin down and transfer each ABC superna-tant to a new tube.      18.    Add ACN up to completely cover gel pieces and incubate for 10 min.      19.    Collect the ACN supernatant and add it to the tube contain-ing the ABC supernatant belonging to the same gel slice ( see   Note 28  ).      20.    Acidify by adding into each tube 10 μl of 20 % TFA per 100 μl of peptide solution.      21.    Dry the solution in a vacuum centrifuge.      22.    Resuspend the pellet in 0.2 % FA and store at −20 or −80 °C until mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.            1.    Fill the gel caster by alternating cassettes with separator sheets, then tighten all the screws evenly.      2.    Place the gradient former on a magnetic stir plate and add a stir bar to the mixing chamber labeled “light” (both stopcocks and the black lever should be in the closed position).
3.    Prepare the “heavy” and “light” acrylamide solutions, except APS and TEMED, and the displacing solution.      4.    Immediately prior to pouring, add TEMED and APS to both solutions, mix evenly, then gently pour the appropriate solu-tions into the gradient chambers ( see   Note 29  ).      5.    Turn on the stirring bar in the mixing chamber to a steady speed and maintain this same speed throughout casting.   3.5  Gradient Gel Casting for 2D-DIGEAlessandro Tanca et al.
127   6.    Start casting the gels by opening the stopcock valve to the multi-casting chamber as well as the valve closer to the gradi-ent former (the black lever on the gradient former is still closed at this time) ( see   Note 30  ).      7.    Allow the light monomer solution to enter the multi-casting chamber until the level of solution in the mixing chamber is equal to the level of the “heavy” solution in the reservoir chamber, then open the black lever on the gradient former and begin mixing the solutions and creating the gradient.      8.    When the acrylamide solution in the gradient chamber has almost ﬁ nished, close the stopcock on the gradient former and add to the reservoir chamber about 200 ml of displacing solution.      9.    Open the stopcock on the gradient former and allow the dis-placing solution to enter the multi-casting chamber until the acrylamide solution has reached the desired level at the top.
10.    Close the stopcock on the multi-casting chamber, immediately pipette water-saturated  n -butanol onto each gel to overlay, and allow gels to polymerize at RT for at least 12 h ( see   Note 31  ).          The following protocol has been optimized using the GE Healthcare materials and apparatus suitable for 2D-DIGE analysis. Alternative reagents and instruments might also be used, but reﬁ nements to the protocol might be therefore necessary.    1.    Precipitate the protein extract(s) to be analyzed by 2D-DIGE it with the 2-D Clean-Up Kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions ( see   Note 32  ).      2.    Resuspend the protein pellet with the TUC buffer, for a ﬁ  nal concentration of about 5 μg/μl ( see   Note 33  ).      3.    Add 1.5 volumes of DMF to 1 volume of CyDye stock solu-tion, to make a 400 pmol/ μl CyDye working solution.      4.    Pipette a volume of protein sample equivalent to 50 μg into a
clean tube, then add 1 μl of CyDye working solution, mix by pipetting and leave on ice for 30 min in the dark.      5.    Add 1 μl of 10 mM lysine to stop the reaction, mix by pipet-ting, and leave for 10 min on ice in the dark.      6.    Add an equal volume of 2-D reducing buffer to each sample and leave on ice for 10 min ( see   Note 34  ).      7.    Mix the labeled protein samples that are going to be separated on the same gel.      8.    Add an adequate volume of rehydration buffer up to 450 μl in total (for 24 cm strips).      9.    Pipette the sample evenly over a slot of the IPG box ( see   Note 35  ).   3.6  2D-DIGEFFPE Tissue Protein Extraction and Analysis
128   10.    Carefully pull off the cover ﬁ  lm from the IPG strip gel and place the strip into the slot, gel-side down, so that the rehydra-tion solution can distribute evenly under the strip.      11.    Gently close the lid of the IPGbox and allow the IPG strip gels to rehydrate at RT for 6–24 h ( see   Note 36  ).      12.    Transfer the strips from the IPGbox to the IPGphor manifold, so that strips are faced up under the cover ﬂ  uid with the anodic end (+) pointing at the anode of the IPGphor.      13.    Add 150 μl deionized water to each paper wick (two per strip), and position the wicks on each end of the IPG strips so that one end of the wick overlaps the end of the IPG strip gel.      14.    With the electrode cams in the open position, put the elec-trode assembly on top of all the wicks (the electrode must be in contact with the wick), then close the lid and start the appropriate IEF program.      15.    Just before the end of the IEF program, prepare the
equilibration- reduction solution by adding 20 mg DTT per ml of equilibration buffer.      16.    Stop the IEF, drain the excess of mineral oil and brieﬂ  y rinse out the IPG strips with deionized water ( see   Note 37  ) .       17.    Position each IPG strip in a slot of the equilibration tray, add an adequate volume of equilibration-reduction solution up to completely cover the strip and incubate for 15 min with gentle agitation.      18.    Turn the pump valve of the Ettan DALTtwelve to “circulate,” then ﬁ  ll the tank to the 7.5 l line with 1× running buffer.      19.    On the control unit, adjust the temperature to the desired set-ting (25 °C) and turn the pump on.      20.    Prepare the equilibration-alkylation solution by adding 25 mg IAM per milliliter of equilibration buffer.      21.    Remove DTT solution from the IPG strips, add an adequate
volume of equilibration-alkylation solution up to completely cover the strip and incubate for 15 min with gentle agitation.      22.    Carefully unload the cassettes containing the polymerized gels from the gel caster and rinse the top surface and the glass plates with deionized water to remove residual  n -butanol and acrylamide.      23.    Using forceps, remove the equilibrated IPG strips from the equilibration solution and rinse them with fresh SDS running buffer.      24.    Slowly pipette agarose solution on the top of each gel, then position the strip centered on the glass plate, and push against the plastic backing of the IPG strip (with forceps or a plastic support) to slide the strip between the two glass plates until it is into contact with the surface of the slab gel.   Alessandro Tanca et al.
129   25.    Carefully slide the gels into the tank and ﬁ  ll the upper buffer chamber with 2.5 l of 2× running buffer (up to the min/max ﬂ uid line) ( see   Note 38  ).      26.    Close the lid, set the running conditions according to the desired run length (for instance, 1 W per gel overnight) and start the run.      27.    When the run has ﬁ  nished, unload the gel cassettes from the electrophoresis chamber, rinse them with deionized water and proceed with image acquisition using Typhoon laser scanner.      28.    Upload the image ﬁ  les into the DeCyder software and carry out differential analysis according to the software manual.            1.    Collect a volume of the protein sample obtained in  step 2  , Subheading  3.6 , corresponding to at least 300 μg of samples (preferably 500–700 μg).      2.    Perform 2D-PAGE analysis according to  steps 8  – 26  of Subheading  3.6 .      3.    When the run has ﬁ  nished, unload the cassette from the elec-
trophoresis chamber, open it and carefully put the gel into a clean container.      4.    Fix the gel with ﬁ  xing solution for 30–60 min, stain overnight with a colloidal Coomassie dye, destain with deionized water and proceed with image acquisition using a ﬂ  atbed scanner ( see   Note 39  ).      5.    Excise from the preparative gel all the differential spots identi-ﬁ ed upon DeCyder analysis.      6.    Shrink gel slices by adding ACN (up to completely cover the gel piece) and incubating for 10 min at RT.      7.    Perform in gel digestion and peptide recovery according to  steps 11  – 22  of Subheading  3.4 .       4    Notes      1.    FFPE tissue blocks should be carefully selected and evaluated by an expert pathologist in order to assure the presence of a minimum percentage of cells of the desired tissue type (for instance, >90 % of neoplastic tissue), and consecutive sections should be obtained for proteomic analysis. In general, ﬁ  ve
5-μm-thick tissue sections should provide sufﬁ  cient material for a gel-based proteomic analysis. Furthermore, especially for precious tumor samples, an additional step of manual dissec-tion or laser microdissection can be favorably added to enrich in cancer cells and keep the amount of adjacent connective and normal tissue to the minimum.   3.7  Preparation of a Preparative Gel, Excision, and Digestion of Differential SpotsFFPE Tissue Protein Extraction and Analysis
130   2.    Safe-lock tubes should be used, since a loose locking may cause the tube to “uncork” during the high temperature incu-bation steps, with a consequent loss of biological material.      3.    Xylene may cause harmful effects by eye and skin contact as well as by inhalation, ingestion or aspiration, spanning from minor irritation to headache, nausea and vomiting. It has therefore to be used with care, wearing gloves and under a chemical hood. As an alternative for tissue deparafﬁ  nization, a mineral oil mix-ture (heated at 95 °C) can be used with similar results.      4.    Several different extraction buffers have been described in the literature as suitable for extraction of full-length proteins from FFPE tissue samples. SDS and DTT are both widely recog-nized as essential to ensure a proper extraction and solubiliza-tion of proteins, although their concentration may vary (e.g. 4 % SDS is well documented). The extraction buffer can also
comprise additional reagents, such as octyl glucoside, glycerol and polyethylene glycol [ 4 ].      5.    All solutions containing DTT should be prepared fresh shortly before use. Alternatively, stock solutions without DTT may be prepared, and an appropriate amount of DTT powder may be added just prior to use.      6.    The use of a protein quantitation method being compatible with detergents (SDS) and reducing agents (DTT) is manda-tory. The ﬂ  uorescence-, membrane-based EZQ™ system is the most used in our lab with FFPE protein extracts for three rea-sons: (a) it requires a very low volume of sample for quantiﬁ  ca-tion (1 μl); (b) it provides a satisfactory level of linearity and sensitivity even for solutions with low protein concentrations; (c) the washing steps enable an efﬁ  cient removal of most detergent and reducing agent. These characteristics ﬁ  t well with the very low size of many FFPE tissue samples, and
therefore with the low amount and/or concentration of the corresponding protein extracts. Anyway, comparable or even better quantiﬁ  cation performance can be achieved using alter-native detergent and reductant compatible methods.      7.    It has been demonstrated that FFPE protein extracts contain a lower amount of high molecular weight (MW) proteins com-pared to fresh-frozen tissues; a general depletion in the upper part of 1D- or 2D-PAGE pattern can be therefore observed in most cases. According to this, in order to enhance resolution in the medium–low MW part of the pattern, an acrylamide percentage higher than that used for other samples can be con-veniently chosen for gel-based separation (e.g. 4–20 % for pre-cast gradient gels and 10–18 % for home-made, large format gradient gels; 14 % ﬁ  xed-percentage gels can also be used).      8.    Alternatively, semi-dry or dry protein transfer systems could be used with similar results.   Alessandro Tanca et al.
131   9.    Alternatively, a PVDF membrane can be employed. In this case, preliminary activation of PVDF membrane with metha-nol is needed.      10.    Up to 0.1 % SDS may be added to the transfer buffer to maxi-mize transfer of hydrophobic proteins.      11.    Membrane staining with Ponceau is aimed at: (a) verifying if bubbles have formed which hamper a complete transfer of the proteins from certain regions of the gel; (b) checking if the total load of the different samples is actually comparable; (c) acquire an image of the total protein pattern which can be overlapped to the ﬁ  nal antibody signal as a control.      12.    DMF can have carcinogen and teratogen effects, and thus needs to be used with great care, wearing gloves and under a chemical hood. It is also very important that a high grade, anhydrous DMF is used to ensure an efﬁ  cient labeling. Use a DMF bottle less than 3 months old from day of opening and prevent it from being exposed to air or water.
13.    Using a large strip format (24 cm) is advised to reach a high resolution and a proper separation of protein spots.      14.    The IPGbox kit allows the passive rehydration to be performed in the dark and, more importantly, without the need for cover-ing the strips with mineral oil.      15.    Some research groups have replaced methanol (more toxic) with ethanol (safer, but slightly less efﬁ  cient).      16.    The ABC solution should be ﬁ  ltered before use and stored at 4 °C to avoid contaminations.      17.    Take particular care when removing supernatant in order not to throw away tissue portions. If extracting proteins from  ﬁ lamentous or colloidal tissues, increasing centrifugation time may help pellet the tissue more efﬁ  ciently.      18.    Tissue pellets may also be vacuum dried, in order to maximize
absorption and penetration of the extraction buffer in the next step. However, special attention to be paid to the vacuum cen-trifugation time to avoid excessive drying (or even burning) which would make it difﬁ  cult or impossible to resuspend the tissue in the extraction buffer.      19.    Usually gently mixing with a tip (a movement approximately like stirring coffee with a spoon) is enough to adequately ensure contact between buffer solution and tissue fragments. Strictly avoid vortexing or hard pipetting, because of the pres-ence of SDS in the buffer. Alternatively, a tissue disruption step (e.g. performed using a steel bead and a mechanical homogenizer) may allow a deeper and more even penetration of the extraction buffer within the tissue.      20.    At this stage, an overnight storage at −80 °C may help improve lysis and protein release from the tissue.   FFPE Tissue Protein Extraction and Analysis
132   21.    If a clear separation between the residual pellet and the protein containing supernatant does not occur, collect the greatest possible volume of supernatant without touching the tissue, then centrifuge again the remaining “wet” pellet for at least 15 min at 16,000 ×  g  to “squeeze” it. Finally, collect the new supernatant and merge it with the one obtained previously.      22.    The protein load should be settled depending on the follow-ing factors: (a) concentration/abundance of the target antigen within the protein mixture; (b) speciﬁ  city of the antibody; (c) sensitivity of the chemiluminescent substrate and of the signal detection system. For a medium–low abundance antigen, a monoclonal antibody, the Sigma chemiluminescent peroxi-dase substrate and the VersaDoc imager, 1 μg of total protein should be enough.      23.

be extended to 1.5–2 h.      24.    Incubations may be extended up to overnight based on sam-ple or antibody characteristics. For overnight incubations, pre- incubate the membrane at RT for approx. 30 min, then keep the membrane at 4 °C during the night, and ﬁ  nally equilibrate the membrane the day after at RT for other 30 min.      25.    If using the VersaDoc imaging system, a 5 min exposure is usually enough to detect a visible signal.      26.    The number of slices in which the lane is cut (i.e. the degree of sample fractionation) is usually proportional to the number of protein identiﬁ  cations achieved through MS analysis. Alternatively, the number of protein identiﬁ  cations can be also increased by increasing the length of the LC separation prior to MS (a detailed description of the LC-MS/MS analysis methods is outside the scope of this chapter).      27.    Alternatively, samples can be destained using a solution con-
taining 40 % (v/v) ethanol and 75 mM ABC and/or incubat-ing the samples at 56 °C and 500 rpm in a thermomixer until the blue dye is no longer visible.      28.    If the gel pieces are not completely shrunk and opaque after collecting ACN, add fresh ACN up to cover the gel pieces, incubate for 10 min, collect the new ACN supernatant and add it to the supernatant mixture belonging to the same gel slice.      29.    In other words, the solution with the lower acrylamide con-centration is to be poured in the mixing chamber labeled “light,” and the solution with the higher acrylamide concen-tration in the reservoir chamber labeled “heavy.” Note that the level of the solutions in the two chambers will NOT be equal at this time.

The multi-casting chamber should be stored at RT possibly overnight to ensure the complete acrylamide polymerization. In fact, acrylamide polymerization continues in a “silent” way even after gels start to visually appear as polymerized. Afterwards, unused gels can be stored between wet papers at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.      32.    Protein precipitation is performed to remove SDS and make protein solution suitable for IEF separation. Alternatively, detergent removal spin columns, dialysis membranes, or MW-cut- off spin ﬁ  lters can be used to eliminate SDS from the protein extract.      33.    At this stage, sample pH should be between 8 and 9 to ensure maximum labeling efﬁ  ciency.      34.    After this step, cyanine-labeled samples can be stored for at least 3 months at −80 °C in the dark.

Overnight rehydration is recommended to allow high MW proteins to enter the gel.      37.    Focused strips can be stored at −80 °C for a few weeks.      38.    Lubricate glasses with running buffer to prevent the rubber tubing from sticking to the cassettes.      39.    Alternatively, gels can be stained with ﬂ  uorescent dyes (e.g. Sypro Ruby) and their image can be acquired using an imager suitable for ﬂ  uorescent signal detection.            References     1.

However, several aspects of the classical IP procedure such as nonspeciﬁ  c protein binding to the isolation matrix, detergents or high salt concentrations in wash and elution buffers, and antibody chain contamination in elution fractions render it incompatible with downstream mass spec-trometry analysis. Here, we discuss two IP workﬂ  ows that are designed to minimize or eliminate these con-
taminants: the ﬁ  rst employs biotinylated antibodies and streptavidin magnetic beads while the second method utilizes a traditional antibody that is oriented and cross-linked to Protein AG magnetic beads. Both modiﬁ  ed magnetic supports have low background binding and both antibody immobilization strategies signiﬁ  cantly reduce or eliminate antibody heavy and light chain contamination in the eluent, minimizing potential ion suppression effects and thereby maximizing detection of target antigens and interacting proteins.

tions [ 5 – 12 ], or identifying interacting proteins [ 13 – 16 ]. An anti-body is used to bind an antigen in cell lysates, serum, or tissue homogenates and the resulting immune complexes are captured on a solid phase support such as a chromatography resin, magnetic bead, plastic plate, or membrane. Mass spectrometry is increasingly becoming the detection methodology of choice for IPs as the tech-nology has the capability to be used for discovery experiments to identify protein interactors [ 14 ,  16 – 19 ], semi- quantitatively in con-junction with SILAC or TMT-labeling [ 20 – 25 ], or quantitatively in selective reaction monitoring (SRM) assays [ 26 – 30 ] (Fig.  1 ).
136 While the best antibody for IP enrichment is highly speciﬁ  c for its target antigen, other abundant proteins from the sample milieu can potentially bind nonspeciﬁ  cally to the antibody, the antigen, or the solid support to which the antibody is immobilized. Buffers containing salt and/or detergent are typically used to eliminate these nonspeciﬁ  c protein binders, however, low-afﬁ  nity and tran-sient interactions are at risk of being washed away during those steps. In addition, high salt and detergent are not compatible with downstream mass spectrometry analysis. The use of protein cross- linking reagents is a viable strategy to preserve low-afﬁ  nity com-plexes [ 17 ,  19 ,  31 ] during high stringency washes but creates an additional level of complexity during the peptide/protein identiﬁ  -cation process and still results in high salt or detergent carry-over in the ﬁ  nal sample. In addition to abundant protein contaminants
from the original sample, antibody chains leach off the supports during the IP elution step and become signiﬁ  cant contaminants as well. The presence of large quantities of any type of contaminating protein can suppress ionization of the low-abundant target of inter-est, preventing its detection in the mass spectrometer. The choice of IP solid support, the antibody attachment strategy, and the IP protocol itself are critical areas to optimize in order to minimize nonspeciﬁ  c protein binding and maximize antigen capture (Fig.  2 ).

Low-abundant proteins in a complex sample matrix typi-
cally need to be enriched in order to detect or quantify them. Protein targets are immunoprecipitated, processed by in-gel or in-solution digestion, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS to identify proteins in the IP/Co-IP eluent, probe for post-translational modiﬁ  cations, or select candidate peptides. Furthermore, heavy isotope- labeled peptide standards can be added to the sample for targeted LC-SRM/MS for absolute quantitation. Gel electrophoresis followed by silver stain or Western blot is still typically used as a validation component to this workﬂ  ow        Barbara Kaboord et al.
137 Presented here are two IP strategies that minimize both the amount of nonspeciﬁ  c protein binding to the immunoafﬁ  nity matrix and the amount of antibody that leaches into the eluted target. The ﬁ  rst involves use of a biotinylated antibody and strep-tavidin magnetic beads. The biotin-labeling process results in mul-tiple biotin modiﬁ  cations per antibody molecule, thus providing multiple contacts or binding points to the streptavidin beads. Because the biotin–streptavidin interaction is extremely high afﬁ  n-ity ( K  D  = 10 −15  M) and highly resistant to acid elution, the quantity of antibody chains found in the eluent is signiﬁ  cantly less than a classical IP with Protein A or G (Fig.  3 ). Tactically, the use of bio-tinylated antibodies in IPs is advantageous since biotin labeling is compatible with any antibody species and subtype and utilizes a common streptavidin support matrix. This simpliﬁ  es the overall
workﬂ  ow and makes the biotin–streptavidin IP approach amenable to multiplexing (e.g. immunoprecipitating and quantifying multi-ple targets within a cellular signaling pathway). In addition, the biotin/streptavidin approach is preferred with clinical samples such as serum or other biological ﬂ  uid which normally contains  endogenous antibodies that would interfere with binding to the classical Protein AG immunoprecipitation support.    Fig. 2    Evaluation of resin types and IP strategies using an EGFR immunoprecipitation model system. Direct IP (antibody pre-immobilized on the solid support followed by incubation with sample) was compared for three supports (Polyacrylamide (P), Agarose (A) and Magnetic (M)) and four different chemistries of directly coupled antibody. Additionally, biotinylated antibody and two immobilized streptavidin resins were used in an Indirect
IP method (antibody + sample preincubation before binding to solid support). ( a ) Capture efﬁ  ciency was deter-mined by Western blot. ( b ) EGFR sequence coverage and background proteins were determined by LC-MS/MS after IP elutions and trypsin digestion. IP using streptavidin magnetic beads resulted in fewer background proteins identiﬁ  ed and higher EGFR sequence coverage        IP-MS
138 The second IP strategy is an oriented, cross-linked afﬁ  nity method [ 25 ,  32 – 34 ] that uses Protein AG magnetic beads to cap-ture the antibody similar to a classical IP however, before the anti-gen is introduced, the antibody is covalently cross-linked to the Protein AG using a homobifunctional cross-linker such as DSS. This cross-linking virtually eliminates the presence of IgG heavy and light chain contamination in the eluent (Fig.  3 ). The oriented, cross-linked approach is a good option if the antibody contains a carrier protein as the binding to Protein AG serves as a puriﬁ cation step before the cross-linking event.

( b ) Indirect and direct IP methods were used to evaluate enrichment of PP2A, catalytic subunit (PPP2CA/PPP2CB) from 0.5 mg A431 cell lysate using Streptavidin magnetic beads and Protein AG magnetic beads. IP elutions were processed by in-solution digestion method and analyzed by LC-MS/MS to assess sequence coverage and identify isoform-speciﬁ  c peptides. MS analysis of IP methods using streptavidin and Protein AG magnetic bead supports allowed for identiﬁ  cation of two PP2A
catalytic subunits (PPP2CA and B), two PP2A regulatory subunits (PPP2R1A and B) and PP4 catalytic subunit (PPP4C). Protein AG cross-link IP method resulted in slight decrease in PPP2CA recovery as indicated by Western blot and by the percent sequence coverage obtained in the mass spectrometry analysis        Barbara Kaboord et al.
139AG combines the binding characteristics of both Protein A and Protein G, this IP approach also works with a variety of antibody species and subtypes. Classical IP without cross-linking of antibody to Protein AG can always be performed if the presence of antibody chains in the eluent is not a concern (e.g. if performing targeted detection such as SRM assays).  IP enrichment is essential to identifying low abundance targets in a complex biological milieu. Many cell signaling proteins and biomarkers are low copy number and are not detected in crude lysates or biological ﬂ  uids due to the presence of a multitude of other proteins competing for ionization even after LC fraction-ation. However, with upstream IP enrichment, low-abundant sig-naling proteins such as EGFR, AKT1, AKT2, PTEN, PIK3CA, PIK3R2, KRAS, and STAT1 can be detected and successfully iden-tiﬁ ed (Table  1 ). While other biochemical methods of afﬁ  nity puri-
ﬁ cation upstream of mass spectrometry (AP-MS) exist [ 35 ,  36 ], immunoafﬁ  nity puriﬁ  cation is used most often for speciﬁ  c enrich-ment of endogenous protein(s) and is the focus of the protocols described in this chapter.

3    Methods   The most common approach to biotin-label antibodies is to use  N -hydroxysucciminimide (NHS) esters. At pH 7–9, NHS-biotin esters will react speciﬁ  cally with the primary amines in lysine side chains and the N-terminus, creating a stable amide bond. However, the number of biotins incorporated per antibody should be con-trolled to prevent inactivation of primary amines that may be required for antigen recognition and/or aggregation and precipi-tation due to over-biotinylation. Utilizing biotinylation reagents with polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer arms imparts greater water solubility to biotin-labeled antibodies, helping to prevent aggrega-tion. Using the appropriate molar excess of NHS ester over anti-body helps titrate the number of biotin labels introduced. In the following protocol, a 40-fold molar excess of biotin was found to result in approximately 2–12 biotin moieties per antibody, a quan-
tity that was found to maximize binding of an antibody on strepta-vidin beads, preserve antibody function, and minimize leaching of antibody into the eluent due to multiple contact points with the support.    1.

Mix 50–200 μg antibody in PBS ( see   Note 4  ) with a 40-fold molar excess of NHS-PEG 4 -biotin in a total reaction volume of 100 μl. Pipette gently to mix.      4.    Incubate the biotin labeling reaction at room temperature for 30 min. Remove excess non-reacted and hydrolyzed biotin reagent by desalting spin column.      5.    Centrifuge a 0.5 ml desalting spin column at 1,500 ×  g  for 1 min to remove the storage solution.      6.    Equilibrate the desalting column by washing three times with 300 μl PBS.      7.    Place desalting column in a fresh collection tube and add the reaction gently to the top of the resin bed.      8.    Centrifuge at 1,500 ×  g  for 2 min. Biotinylated antibody is present in the ﬂ  ow-through and is now in PBS ( see   Note 5  ).
9.    Prepare cell or tissue lysates in IP Lysis Buffer to a ﬁ  nal con-centration of 1 mg/ml ( see   Note 6  ). Sample size per IP reac-tion is typically 500 μl (500 μg). For serum or plasma samples, dilute 20 μl (~1 mg) of serum or plasma in 480 μl IP Lysis Buffer.      10.    For optimal results, pre-clear 500 μl of the lysate sample by incubating with 25 μl of streptavidin magnetic beads for 1 h at room temperature (optional) ( see   Note 7  ).      11.    Prepare the immune complex by incubating above lysate with 5 μg of antibody overnight at 4 °C with continuous end-over- end rotation ( see   Note 8  ).      12.    Dispense 25 μl streptavidin magnetic beads (for each IP reac-tion) into a low-binding microcentrifuge tube, collect the beads on a magnetic stand for 1 min and remove the storage solution. Wash the beads twice with IP Lysis Buffer, mixing gently each time to fully suspend the beads. Collect the beads
between each wash by placing the tubes on a magnetic stand for 1 min. Discard the supernatants (wash volumes).      13.    Add the immune complex prepared in  step 11   to the washed streptavidin-magnetic beads and incubate at room tempera-ture for 1 h with end-over-end rotation.      14.    Collect the beads on a magnetic stand for 1 min.      15.    Gently remove the supernatant (ﬂ  ow-through or non-bound) and save for analysis if desired.   Barbara Kaboord et al.
143   16.    Wash the beads with 3 × 500 μl 25 mM Ammonium bicarbon-ate, pH 8, by gently vortexing the beads to resuspend during each wash step ( see   Note 9  ).      17.    Wash the beads with 2 × 500 μl of LC-MS grade water, by gently vortexing the beads to resuspend during each wash step ( see   Note 10  ).      18.

Collect the beads on a magnetic stand and transfer the elution to a fresh microcentrifuge tube.      20.    Dry the elution in a speed vac.      21.    Proceed to mass spec sample prep (   Subheading 3.3) and/or resuspend in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blot analy-sis/validation.        An alternative strategy to minimize antibody leaching would be to physically cross-link the antibody to the afﬁ  nity support either
directly to a chemically-activated support or to an immobilized Protein AG bead. The cross-linked Protein AG approach results in an oriented antibody to maximize antigen capture and is the pre-ferred strategy when the antibody contains a carrier protein such as BSA or gelatin. A common homobifunctional cross-linker such as disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) reacts with amine groups on the antibody and those on the Protein AG support. As with the use of NHS-biotin esters, DSS must be used at the appropriate concen-tration to minimize inactivation of essential amines in the antigen recognition site that would lead to loss of antibody function. Small decreases in antigen binding are commonly observed with the cross-linked IP method, but this loss of function may not be fully recognized in practice as the immobilized antibody beads are gen-erally still in excess over the target antigen [ 32 ,  33 ] ( see   Note 12  ).
1.    Vortex the bottle of Pierce Protein AG Magnetic Beads to obtain a homogeneous suspension. Dispense 25 μl of mag-netic bead suspension into a low-binding microcentrifuge tube ( see   Note 13  ). Place tube on a magnetic stand for 1 min to collect the beads. Remove and discard the storage solution.      2.    Wash the beads twice with 500 μl Modiﬁ  ed PBS, mixing gen-tly each time to fully suspend the beads. Collect the beads between each wash by placing the tubes on a magnetic stand for 1 min. Discard the supernatants (wash volumes).      3.    Dilute antibody in Modiﬁ  ed PBS to a ﬁ  nal concentration of 5 μg per 100 μl ( see   Note 14  ).   3.2  Cross-linked IP MethodIP-MS
144   4.    Add 100 μl of diluted antibody solution to the washed mag netic beads and incubate at room temperature for 15 min, gently vortexing the beads every 5–10 min during incubation to ensure that the beads stay in suspension.      5.    Collect the beads with a magnetic stand. Remove and discard the supernatant.      6.    Wash the bound antibody-bead complexes twice with 300 μl Modiﬁ  ed PBS. For each wash, thoroughly mix to suspend the beads, collect on a magnetic stand for 1 min, then remove and discard each wash volume.      7.    Resuspend the beads in 46 μl PBS. Add 4 μl of 0.25 mM DSS in DMSO or DMF (20 μM ﬁ nal concentration; 10X molar excess DSS over immobilized Protein AG) ( see   Note 15  ).      8.    Incubate the cross-linker with antibody-Protein AG beads for 30 min at room temperature, vortexing gently every 10–15 min during the incubation to ensure an even bead suspension.      9.    Collect the beads with a magnetic stand. Remove the
supernatant.      10.    Quench the cross-linking reaction and remove non-cross- linked antibody by adding 100 μl 0.1 M glycine buffer, pH 2 to the beads and gently mixing for 5 min at room temperature ( see   Note 16  ). Collect the beads with a magnetic stand and remove the supernatant.      11.    Perform two additional 100 μl washes with glycine buffer.      12.    Equilibrate the cross-linked beads by washing twice with 200 μl cold IP Lysis/Wash Buffer each wash.      13.    Prepare cell or tissue lysates in IP Lysis Buffer to a ﬁ  nal con-centration of 1 mg/ml ( see   Note 6  ). Sample size per IP reac-tion is typically 500 μl (500 μg). For serum or plasma samples, dilute 20 μl (~1 mg) of serum or plasma in 480 μl IP Lysis Buffer.      14.    Add 500 μl lysate to the cross-linked magnetic beads and incu-bate for 1 h at room temperature with end-over-end mixing. Alternatively, vortex the beads every 10–15 min during the
incubation to ensure that the beads stay in suspension.      15.    Collect the beads on a magnetic stand for 1 min.      16.    Gently remove the supernatant (ﬂ  ow-through or non-bound) and save for analysis if desired.      17.    Wash the beads with 3 × 500 μl 25 mM Ammonium bicarbon-ate, pH 8, by gently vortexing the beads to resuspend during each wash step ( see   Note 9  ).      18.    Wash the beads with 2 × 500 μl of LC-MS grade water, by gently vortexing the beads to resuspend during each wash step ( see   Note 10  ).   Barbara Kaboord et al.
145   19.    Elute bound antigen by adding 100 μl elution buffer (0.5 % f ormic acid/30 % acetonitrile), and incubating for 5 min at room temperature with periodic gentle vortexing ( see   Note 11  ).      20.    Collect the beads on a magnetic stand and transfer the elution to a fresh low-binding microcentrifuge tube.      21.    Dry the elution in a speed vac.      22.    Proceed to mass spec sample prep (Subheading 3.3) and/or resuspend in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blot analy sis/validation.        The proteins present in the IP elution fractions are typically dena-tured, reduced, alkylated, and digested into peptides prior to detec-tion by mass spectrometry, because peptides fractionate, ionize, and fragment more efﬁ  ciently than intact proteins. In addition, the resulting peptide mass spectra are easier to interpret during the pr otein identiﬁ  cation process. Because the protein amount in the IP eluent
is small, an in-solution digestion workﬂ  ow is preferred as it mini-mizes sample loss, is fast and is amenable to high- throughput and automation. Samples are ﬁ  rst denatured in a strong chaotrope such as urea to facilitate complete digestion. Disulﬁ  de bonds are reduced with tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) or dithiothreitol (DTT) and bond reformation is prevented by alkylating free sulfhy-dryl groups with iodoacetamide. The fully denatured proteins are then digested with trypsin, although other proteases and protease combinations can be used (e.g. chymotrypsin, Glu-C, Lys- C). The resulting peptides are applied to C-18 tips or columns to remove salts and buffers and to concentrate the sample prior to analysis by nano or capillary reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC), elec-trospray ionization, and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The peptides are identiﬁ  ed by sequence database searching using the search algorithm SEQUEST or Mascot. The signiﬁ  cance of
each peptide and protein identiﬁ  cation is estimated using the soft-ware tools, Thermo Scientiﬁ  c™ Proteome Discoverer™ 1.4 and Scaffold 4.0 software to assess percent sequence coverage, spectral counts, and post-translational modiﬁ  cation (PTMs).    1.    Suspend dried samples in 10 μl denaturation buffer ( see   Note 17  ).      2.    Add 10 μl of 10 mM TCEP to each sample and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. Centrifuge brieﬂ  y to collect condensate to bottom of tube.      3.    To each 20 μl sample of reduced protein add 0.83 μl of 0.5 M iodoacetamide solution (ﬁ  nal concentration 20 mM). Incubate at room temperature for 30 min in the dark (cover sample tubes with foil OR place samples in a drawer).      4.    Add 45 μl of 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0 to dilute urea concen-tration to <1 M.   3.3  Mass Spec Sample Prep and Data AnalysisIP-MS
146   5.    Add 3 μl of 10 ng/ μl trypsin to each sample (30 ng trypsin per sample). Brieﬂ  y vortex and digest overnight at 37 °C in a ther-momixer at 500 rpm. Centrifuge brieﬂ  y to collect condensate to bottom of tube.      6.    Acidify samples by adding 2 μl of 10 % TFA (pH <3) and vor-tex brieﬂ  y.      7.    Centrifuge at 15,000 ×  g  for 2 min to pellet the insoluble sample.      8.    Insert Pierce C18 spin tip into spin adapter seated in a labeled 1.5 ml low-binding microcentrifuge tube (one for each sample).      9.    Wet each C18 tip by adding 20 μl of 80 % acetonitrile/0.1 % TFA and centrifuge at 1,000 ×  g  for 1 min. Repeat one addi-tional time.      10.    Equilibrate tip by adding 20 μl of 0.1 % TFA and centrifuge at 1,000 ×  g  for 1 min. Repeat one additional time.      11.    Apply 68 μl of each digested sample to their corresponding C18 tip and collect ﬂ  ow-through in the new labeled 1.5 ml
low-binding microcentrifuge tube by centrifuging at 1,000 ×  g  for 3 min ( see   Note 18  ).      12.    Reapply samples to their designated C18 tips and spin again at 1,000 ×  g  for 3 min.      13.    Wash each C18 tip by adding 20 μl of 0.1 % TFA at 1,000 ×  g  for 1 min. Repeat one additional time.      14.    Elute the samples into new 1.5 ml low-binding microcentri-fuge tubes using 2 × 20 μl of 80 % acetonitrile/0.1 % TFA and centrifuging at 1,000 ×  g  for 1 min.      15.    Speed vac samples to near dryness and resuspend samples with 30 μl of 5 % acetonitrile/0.1 % formic acid before MS Analysis.      16.    Take out 15 μl of sample into autosampler vial and perform LC-MS/MS analysis on an Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer or equivalent.       4    Notes      1.    The NHS-ester moiety readily hydrolyzes and becomes non- reactive. Do not prepare solutions for storage. Discard any unused reconstituted reagent. Suspending the NHS-ester in a
dry solvent such as DMF or DMSO instead of water will slow the hydrolysis rate, but storage should be limited to <1 month at −20 °C.      2.    A very low percentage of detergent facilitates magnetic bead collection and handling. NP-40 can be substituted with Tween-20 if desired.   Barbara Kaboord et al.
147   3.    For in-solution digestion methods, detergents cannot be used in the denaturation process since they will interfere in subse-quent MS analysis. Instead of 6 M urea, other common dena-turants that are used for in-solution digestion include 6 M guanidine-HCl, 10 % sodium deoxycholate and 50 % 2,2,2- Triﬂ uoroethanol (TFE). In order for trypsin to work most efﬁ  ciently, the concentration of the denaturants need to be at a compatible ﬁ  nal concentration (<1 M urea, <0.5 M guanidine-HCl, <1 % sodium deoxycholate, and <5 % TFE).      4.    For the biotinylation reaction, the antibody must be in an amine-free buffer (such as PBS; avoid Tris or glycine buffers) with no carrier protein (BSA or gelatin) present. Proteins or other amine-containing molecules will interfere with amine- reactive biotin labeling reagents. For optimal results, use an afﬁ nity-puriﬁ  ed antibody. If the antibody is not in an amine-
free buffer such as PBS, perform buffer exchange by dialysis or desalting column. Remove carrier proteins from commercially- available antibodies by Protein AG puriﬁ  cation or using a commercially available antibody puriﬁ  cation kit such as Pierce Antibody Clean-up Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁ  c).      5.    If desired, the extent of antibody biotinylation can be deter-mined using a commercially-available kit such as the Fluorescence Biotin Quantitation Kit from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁ  c.      6.    IP Lysis Buffer has been tested on representative cell types including, but not limited to, HeLa, Jurkat, A431, A549, MOPC, NIH 3T3, and U2OS. Typically, 10 6  HeLa cells yield ~10 mg of cell pellet and ~3 μg/μl (or 300 μg) total protein when lysed with 100 μl of IP Lysis Buffer. IP Lysis Buffer is compatible with the Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁ  c). To minimize protein degradation and pre-serve phosphorylation modiﬁ  cations during lysate prepara-
tion, use protease and phosphatase inhibitors (e.g. Thermo Scientiﬁ  c™ Halt™ Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail) in the IP Lysis Buffer.      7.    Pre-clearing cell lysates or tissue homogenates by incubating with streptavidin beads in the  absence   of antibody helps remove certain biotin-containing enzymes such as carboxylases and decarboxylases that would normally bind directly to the strep-tavidin support independent of the presence of antibody, con-tributing to background.      8.    The indirect method (binding antibody to antigen overnight to form the immune complex followed by incubation with streptavidin beads in a subsequent step) is the preferred IP method when using low afﬁ  nity antibodies or enriching for very low abundant targets. Alternatively, the antibody-bead complex can be assembled ﬁ  rst and then incubated with the IP-MS
148protein sample (direct method). The direct method is faster, but formation of the antibody–antigen complex is somewhat less efﬁ  cient due to potential mixing inefﬁ  ciencies and the need to abbreviate the incubation time of magnetic beads with lysates to minimize nonspeciﬁ  c protein binding to the solid support that would normally occur with an overnight incuba-tion. The direct method works well with medium-abundant targets and is more amenable to automation.      9.    Typical IP wash buffers contain detergent or salt to wash away weak, nonspeciﬁ  cally-bound proteins. However, salts and detergents are not compatible with downstream mass spec analysis. Ammonium bicarbonate is used in place of these wash buffers because it is volatile, and thus removed, during subse-quent speed vac steps.      10.    Water washes are performed to eliminate any residual deter-gent from the IP Lysis buffer used to prepare the cell or tissue
lysate and to remove any residual buffering capacity before the acid elution step. LC-MS grade water has low UV absorbance to ensure maximum sensitivity at all detection wavelengths.      11.    The elution buffer formulation described is fairly stringent and highly effective (boiling the magnetic beads in a denaturing SDS-PAGE loading buffer shows that all of the antigen was efﬁ ciently eluted with the 0.5 % formic acid/30 % acetoni-trile). However, very slight contamination by antibody chains was observed in the elution due to a small degree of antibody denaturation or a weakening of the biotin–streptavidin inter-action. Some antibody–antigen interactions can be efﬁ  ciently disrupted with less acetonitrile (5–10 %) with virtually no anti-body chain contamination, but elution efﬁ  ciency is antibody–antigen dependent.      12.    If the antibody–antigen interaction is known to be very low afﬁ nity or if the antigen is in very low abundance, the IP
efﬁ ciency of the oriented, cross-linked approach may be sig-niﬁ cantly compromised not only by the DSS cross-linking but also by the short (1 h) antibody-bead incubation with lysate sample utilized in the direct IP method. If the binding func-tion of the antibody cannot be restored by titrating the DSS to a lower concentration ( see   Note 15  ), then either a longer (overnight at 4 °C) antibody-bead + lysate incubation may be necessary (but may result in higher background). Alternatively, a classical IP with an antibody + lysate overnight incubation at 4 °C followed by 1 h incubation with Protein AG magnetic beads and no cross-linking may be the best option. This will result in considerable antibody chain contamination in the elution but the target protein of interest still may be able to be detected if it ionizes well.   Barbara Kaboord et al.
149   13.    The protocol is written for the binding and cross-linking of beads and antibody for a single IP reaction (25 μl magnetic bead slurry/reaction). However, this procedure can be scaled up to prepare a larger batch of cross-linked antibody-beads which can be dispensed into individual IP reactions (replicates and controls) before incubation with sample. Scale up anti-body, DSS, and wash quantities proportionately.      14.    Although serum may be used, the antibody that is speciﬁ  c for the antigen of interest may comprise only 1–2 % of the total IgG in the serum sample and will result in low antigen recovery.      15.    If it is known that epitope recognition is mediated by lysine residues in the antibody’s antigen recognition site, it may be necessary to titrate the amount of DSS used to minimize anti-body inactivation. This is accomplished by performing a two-fold dilution series of DSS during the antibody immobilization
reaction. Because DSS is a hydrophobic molecule, a micropre-cipitate may form when it is added to an aqueous medium, which results in a cloudy appearance. The reaction will still proceed efﬁ  ciently and may disappear during conjugation.      16.    Glycine at pH 2 will elute IgG that is not covalently coupled to the immobilized Protein AG. Most polyclonal and most monoclonal antibodies can tolerate low pH conditions for short durations. If the antibody immobilized is intolerant of low pH conditions, wash the beads with a high salt, neutral pH buffer to remove uncoupled antibody instead.      17.    If urea is used for denaturing proteins, the sample should not be boiled before reducing. Urea can carbamylate proteins at high temperatures. Incubation at 37 °C for 30 min is sufﬁ  cient for denaturing the proteins.      18.    For binding to C18 reversed-phase sorbents, a sample must be free of excess organic solvents such as acetonitrile (ACN) or
methanol. For optimal ﬂ  ow and peptide recovery, do not com-pletely dry the C18 tips after equilibration by excessive cen-trifugation times or speed.            References     1.

Basically, three different types of tags are employed: stable isotopes, mass tags, and ﬂ  uorophores. While proteins labeled with stable isotopes and mass tags are measured and differentiated by mass spectr ometry, ﬂ  uorescent labels are detected with ﬂ  uorescence imagers. The major purposes for protein labeling are monitoring of biological processes, reliable quantiﬁ  cation of compounds and speciﬁ  c detection
of protein modiﬁ  cations and isoforms in multiplexed samples, enhancement of detection sensitivity, and simpliﬁ  cation of detection workﬂ  ows. Proteins can be labeled during cell growth by incorporation of amino acids containing different isotopes, or in biological ﬂ  uids, cells or tissue samples by attaching speciﬁ  c groups to the ε-amino group of lysine, the N-terminus, or the cysteine residues. The principles and the modiﬁ  cations of the different labeling approaches on the protein level are described; beneﬁ  ts and short-comings of the methods are discussed.

levels of proteins in complex mixtures. The most commonly applied techniques are the separation by gel electrophoresis and chroma-tography, and further investigation by image analysis, Western blotting, and mass spectrometry. Lately, a comprehensive overview on these tools has been published for the example of environmental microbiology [ 1 ].  The different proteomic proﬁ  ling workﬂ  ows possess various methodological shortcomings, which could partly be prevented or at least reduced by pre-labeling proteins prior to the analysis. Furthermore, labeling of speciﬁ  c protein moieties offers the pos-sibility of studying some dedicated protein modiﬁ  cations. In the following we try to give a small overview on methodical issues,
154where labeling of proteins can improve the quality of the results and enable methodical developments.  The conventional approach for protein detection in gel electro-phoresis is staining the proteins in the gels subsequently to the sepa-ration. A number of post-staining methods exist using organic and ﬂ uorescent dyes, and silver staining [ 2 ]. While the latter shows the highest sensitivity of detection, it has a very limited capacity for quantiﬁ  cation. Labeling of proteins prior to the separation with an appropriate and bright ﬂ  uorescent dye could increase sensitivity and quantiﬁ  cation features at the same time. Furthermore this would enable direct detection after separation, and save time and work.  Proteomics samples are highly complex: biological ﬂ  uids, cell lysates, and tissue extracts contain thousands of different proteins and peptides with very high structural diversities. In the original proﬁ ling approach this challenge is met as follows: With two-
dimensional gel electrophoresis the protein mixture is “individual-ized” into several hundred to a few thousand fraction spots, of which each contains one or a few different proteins. After punch-ing out the spots of interest and digesting the proteins with trypsin inside the gel plug, the resulting peptides are eluted and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. It is still an undisputed fact, that two-dimensional electrophoresis affords the highest resolution of all protein separation methods. The technology using immobilized pH gradients for isoelectric focusing in the ﬁ  rst and high- resolution SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the second dimension has meanwhile been further developed to a robust method with a high level of reproducibility [ 3 ]. However, there exist still little experimental variations, which cause partial protein losses [ 4 ]. The incorporation of an internal control into the samples during sepa-
ration would equalize such effects and improve the quantiﬁ  cation data. This can, however, only be realized by labeling the proteins of different samples with different ﬂ  uorescent tags and working according to a multiplexing concept.  Redox proteomics has gained great importance: Oxido-redox protein modiﬁ  cations, especially of cysteines, link redox metabo-lism to biological structure and function [ 5 ]. One of the strate-gies would be labeling cysteine thiol residues of differently oxidized samples with different ﬂ  uorescent dyes to compare and determine the oxido-redox status of biological material by using 2D electrophoresis.  In the complementary gel-free workﬂ  ow the complete initial protein mixture is digested with endopeptidases. This means that thousands of protein fractions are converted into an even more complex mixture: each protein is cleaved into about 30 peptides on an average. In most cases the workﬂ  ow is performed in an auto-
mated mode; reversed-phase liquid chromatography of the peptides on-line connected to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Due to this enormous heterogeneity of the peptide mixture the Christian Obermaier et al.
155contents of the chromatography peaks are very complex, resulting in undersampling in the mass spectrometer: During the chromatog-raphy separation the mass spectrometer has only a limited time window to produce the related peptide mass spectra, which are therefore incomplete. In practice, repeated runs of the same sample show varying peak spectra; reproducibility is compromised. It is therefore very complicated to ﬁ  nd differences in protein expression between different biological samples: Several technical replicates would be needed to cope with adequate statistical requirements. Furthermore, the gel-free quantiﬁ  cation procedures based on mass spectrometry peaks of peptides suffer from the limitation that the peak intensities of the peptides do not correlate with their abun-dances [ 1 ]. However, because the mass spectrometry peak intensi-ties of identical peptides correlate with their relative abundances in
different samples [ 6 ], labeling of the sample proteins with different stable isotopes or mass tags would facilitate the qualitative and quan-titative assessment of r elative protein abundances in a multiplexing approach. These quantiﬁ  cation issues can also be solved by labeling the peptides after protein digestion using non-isobaric isotope coded amino-reactive groups or isobaric mass tags, which allow quantiﬁ  cation during a tandem MS step.  Thus protein or peptide labeling is indispensable for protein quantiﬁ  cation.  The following review describes the principles of different label ing techniques which are applied on intact proteins, not on the diges tion products, the peptides.  2    Materials  Generally, the use of high-quality electrophoresis/proteomic- grade chemicals is paramount to achieving successful experiments. Fluorescent dyes for pre-labeling are available from a number of specialist suppliers and some ﬁ  ne chemicals companies. Also the
stable isotope labeling kits and the mass tag kits are marketed by several ﬁ  ne chemical and mass spectrometry companies.  3    Methods   The easiest accessible targets for covalently attaching a ﬂ  uorescent group to a protein are the ε-amino groups of the lysines and the N-terminus. According to the UniProt database lysine represents 6 % of amino acids in the average proteins, which—statistically—means that lysines are present in almost every protein. Coupling of a reagent via the  N -hydroxy-succinimide (NHS) ester to primary amines is a robust and well established procedure. Furthermore, it is not necessary to derivatize the proteins prior to the reaction. 3.1  Labeling with Fluorescent Dyes Prior to Electrophoretic SeparationsProtein Labeling Techniques
156In order to ensure accessibility to the ε-amino groups of the lysines, ideally the protein samples are denatured with high molar chaotr opes like urea or a combination of urea and thiourea.  Labeling of proteins prior to electrophoresis with a ﬂ  uorogenic amino reactive label has several advantages over post-staining: no washing and staining procedures are needed, the image can be recorded without ﬁ  xing of the proteins, thus the gels can be fur-ther processed with Western blotting. In this way the results are obtained much faster; the method is more cost and environment friendly and easier, no buffers and organic solvents for staining and washing are required.  Ünlü et al. [ 7 ] have applied the concept of pre-labeling the proteins in their original method “difference gel electrophoresis” (DIGE), which has become one of the most successful methods in comparative proteomics. In the DIGE technique, cyanine-NHS
CyDyes™ with different excitation and emission wavelengths are covalently bound to the protein lysine moieties for multiplex analy-sis with two-dimensional electrophoresis. After the different pro-tein samples have been pre-labeled with Cy2, Cy3, or Cy5 they are combined together, and the mixture is submitted to isoelectric focusing followed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The three dyes have been selected to have sufﬁ  ciently different ﬂ  uores-cent properties to prevent “cross-talking” during imaging. For perfect co-migration of the same proteins to the identical gel posi-tions the dyes are charge-matched and have similar molecular weights. For labeling the lysine moieties with cyanine dyes “mini-mal labeling” is applied: Only a small portion, about 5 %, of the proteins in the sample are labeled by limiting the amount of dye per protein, which is about 400 pM dye per 50 μg of protein. This prevents the proteins from becoming too hydrophobic, and insures
that only singly labeled proteins will be detected. In this minimal labeling concept, the amount of multiple labeled proteins is statis-tically below the detection level. The resulting spot pattern is the same like the pattern obtained from non-labeled proteins. The limit of detection of a single protein is about 25 pg. This means that the sensitivity is similar to silver staining. Downstream analyses with mass spectrometry or Western blotting are not affected, because 95 % of the separated proteins are un-labeled, hence not modiﬁ  ed.  Imaging is performed by exciting the ﬂ  uorophore at the opti-mum wavelength with laser, LED or white light with excitation ﬁ lter and collecting the light with higher wavelength emitted from the ﬂ uorophore using an emission ﬁ  lter with narrow band pass. The patterns created from the different samples can be displayed on the computer screen with false color representation. By super-
imposing these images with an image editing program a preview of the result is obtained, which shows up- and down-regulations of protein expression levels and serves as a control for sample Christian Obermaier et al.
157preparation and labeling, as well as appropriate co-migration of the proteins. For accurate qualitative and quantitative evaluation dedicated 2D software has to be employed. Advanced software packages perform the image analyses almost automatically, for instance by image warping from different gels. The principle of the DIGE method is displayed in Fig.  1a, b   (from ref.  8 ).   Because up to three samples are run in the identical matrix, gel-to gel-variations between the sample patterns are excluded, and the individual spots are co-detected across the samples for the calculation of protein abundance ratios. However, the most pow-erful feature of DIGE is the possibility of the incorporation of an internal control. Therefore, a pooled internal standard is created by mixing aliquots taken from each sample of the experiment. This sample pool is labeled with one of the ﬂ  uorophores, mostly Cy2, and co-electrophoresed with each sample. Thus every protein in
the population appears on each gel. Inherent gel-to-gel variations between gels are compensated. Gel-to-gel matching becomes much easier than in conventional gels, because the patterns of the internal standard need to be matched, which are resulting from the identical sample mixture. For quantitative comparison, the spot volume ratios of the samples are calculated related to the internal standard spot volume. This approach makes it possible to compare protein abundances across different gels with high accuracy. Appropriate sample cleanup and the adherence to exact labeling conditions are very important prerequisites to achieve optimum results ( see   Note 1  ). The principle of the DIGE method is dis-played in Fig.  1a, b . Meanwhile a quadruplex kit with an additional dye molecule for the detection close to infrared light is available, which allows comparison of up to four different samples within one 2D gel.
one 2D gel.  Alternatively, the ﬂ  uorescent dyes can be attached to the thiol group of the cysteine via a maleimide reactive group. Cysteines are less abundant than lysine, which allows saturation labeling without the risk of creating protein modiﬁ  cations with too high hydropho-bicity. This offers a very high sensitivity of detection. Cysteine labeling dyes are charge-neutral, and they have also similar molecu-lar weights. Because all available cysteines will receive a label, the proteins containing many cysteines will become multiply labeled: migrate markedly slower in the SDS gel than unlabeled proteins, and their light emission will be disproportionaly high. Proteins without any cysteine cannot be detected. Thus the spot patterns are different from those achieved with unlabeled or lysine-labeled proteins. The efforts are higher than in lysine labeling: Prior to labeling the disulﬁ  de bridges of the proteins must be cleaved with
a reductant like Triscarboxyethylphosphine (TCEP) or dithiothrei-tol (DTT) ( see   Note 2  ). For cysteine labeling only two dyes are available: Cy3 and Cy5. The internal standard is usually labeled with Cy3, the sample with Cy5. But the detection sensitivity of this Protein Labeling Techniques

159method is very high, which makes it particularly useful for scarce samples or detection of low abundant proteins [ 9 ].  Furthermore, cysteine labeling offers a new opportunity for the speciﬁ  c detection of redox-modiﬁ  ed proteins. The procedure has lately been optimized [ 10 ]: Free protein thiols in sample A can be directly labeled with Cy3 maleimide. However, since some pro-tein thiols may have become oxidized and will no more react with the Cy3 maleimide, the selective labeling of the oxidized subpro-teome (sample B), in particular its reversible modiﬁ  ed thiols, which can become reduced with a reductant such as DTT, might be also of great interest. Thus, in order to maintain the overall spot pat-tern the speciﬁ  c labeling of sample A requires the exclusion of any non-reacted labeling reagent included in sample B and vice versa. Therefore, subsequently to the labeling of sample A, excessive label
is removed via gel ﬁ  ltration, which excludes the labeling of com-ponents of sample B, the none labeled protein thiols, and their irreversible alkylation with the Cys-interacting compound (CinC). In contrast, for sample B, free protein thiols are ﬁ  rst irreversibly alkylated with the Cys-interacting compound (CinC), the excessive alkylating reagent removed via gel ﬁ  ltration, the eluent (eluted/recovered sample) treated with a reductant like DTT, and subse-quently labeled with the Cy3 maleimide.  The individual samples (A or B) are combined with the internal pooled standard (saturated labeled sample) and submitted to a 2D electrophoresis. When the false-color images, where Cy 3 (sample A) is represented in green and Cy3 (sample B) in red, are overlaid, green spots indicate redox-modiﬁ  ed proteins, yellow spots show pro-teins containing occluded thiols. By using CinC instead of the for merly employed  N -ethylmaleimide the pattern matching is improved,
because the molecular sizes of the blocking reagent is more similar to the sizes of the dye-maleimides. Irreversibly oxidized proteins can be visualized by post-staining of the gel.  These differential multiplexing methods have initiated great acceptance of protein labeling with ﬂ  uorophores prior to the sepa-ration [ 11 ]. Their features improve the statistical basis for relative quantitative measurements of protein expression levels consider-ably. These advantages have justiﬁ  ed the relatively high investments for dyes and ﬂ  uorescent imagers.  The vast majority of gels are still post-stained, because of the high price level of the labeling reagents and the investments for ﬂ  uo-rescent imagers. Lately new types of ﬂ  uorescent dye labels for proteins have been introduced [ 12 ], which are less expensive and can also be applied in presence of carrier ampholytes and reductants ( see   Note 3  ).  However, it should be noted that gel-based separation
techniques have some limitations: very large and very small, very hydrophobic proteins—like membrane proteins—and those with very high isoelectric points are not included, LC/MS and CE/MS possess superior sensitivity of detection features.  Protein Labeling Techniques
160  Nonradioactive isotope labeling is a very useful approach for comparing samples by mass spectrometry analysis, because the mass differences introduced into the sample components by differ-ent isotope compositions can be easily detected, while the chemical properties of the molecules are not altered. Thus all the commonly used physico-chemical sample preparation techniques can be applied for reduction of the complexity of the sample.  Such an approach was ﬁ  rst time utilized for proteins by Gysi et al. [ 13 ], introducing isotope-coded afﬁ  nity tags (ICAT): the protein cysteine residues are chemically labeled with a reagent comprised of a thiol-reactive group (iodoacetamide), biotin, and a linker containing either eight hydrogen or eight deuterium atoms. Typically the control sample is labeled with the light and the test sample with the heavy tag and combined in a 1:1 ratio. The mix-ture is digested with an endopeptidase, the—biotin-containing—
labeled peptides are puriﬁ  ed by afﬁ  nity chromatography on a streptavidin column, and submitted to reversed-phase HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry. Peptide pairs originating from differential samples are identiﬁ  ed by a mass difference of 8 Da, their abundances are compared for relative quantiﬁ  cation. Protein identiﬁ  cation is performed by MS/MS analysis of the respective peptides. In order to overcome isotopic shift effects caused by the deuterium interaction with reversed phase chromatography media, and improve MS/MS spectra, the tags were later modiﬁ  ed by using  13 C labels [ 14 ] and a cleavable biotin moiety [ 15 ]. Figure  2  shows a schematic representation of the ICAT workﬂ  ow. A great advan-tage of ICAT is the very efﬁ  cient reduction of sample complexity, because it isolates the few cysteine containing peptides. This makes it very useful for automated LC/MS systems. However, because not all proteins and peptides contain cysteines, the ICAT method
does unfortunately not result in global labeling; this leads to reduced sequence coverage in mass spectrometry analysis and miss-ing values.   An isotopic label can also be introduced metabolically by salts and amino acids containing different compositions of deuterium,  13 C or  15 N during cell growth. The mostly applied in vivo labeling method is SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture) which has been introduced by Ong et al. [ 16 ]. Whereas the growth medium for one cell population contains nor-mal amino acids, the second cell population is fed with a growth medium containing amino acids with heavier isotopes. A number of SILAC variations exist, differing by the choice of amino acids and isotope combinations. After a couple of cell divisions, the labeled amino acids are completely incorporated into the cellular proteins. The samples are mixed and can be directly digested with a protease, or previously separated by electrophoresis or chroma-
tography for reduction of complexity. The peptide mixture is then analyzed by LC-MS, relative protein amounts are quantiﬁ  ed by 3.2  Protein Labeling with Stable IsotopesChristian Obermaier et al.
161comparison of the abundance of respective peptide doublets. The proteins are identiﬁ  ed by MS/MS analysis of the peptides. The SILAC principle is shown in Fig.  3 .   By adding the labeled amino acids to the growth medium for only a short period of time, also differences in de novo protein turn-over can be studied. This method is called Pulsed SILAC [ 17 ]. SILAC generally allows global labeling on the protein level, which is a great advantage of the method. SILAC can only be used for labeling growing cells. Meanwhile SILAC has already been   Fig. 2    Schematic drawing of the principle of ICAT. The different samples are reduced with a thiol reagent and labeled at the free SH groups of their cysteines with the ICAT reagents (light and heavy) via the iodoacetamide group (IAA).

162applied to labeling multicellular model organisms, such as mouse,  Caenorhabiditis elegans  ,  Drosophila melanogaster  , and  Arabidopsis thaliana  .  In order to overcome limitations of the approaches described above, Schmidt et al. have developed Isotope-Coded Protein Labeling (ICPL), which is based on the well-established reaction of  N -nicotinoyloxy-succinimide (Nic-NHS) with the ε-amino group of lysine residues and the available N-termini of intact pro-teins [ 18 ]. The ICPL technology is available with up to four labels, which contain different combinations of hydrogen/deuterium and  12 C and  13 C atoms, and create mass shifts of 0, 4, 6 and 10 Da. In order to facilitate access to all free ε-amino groups of the lysines,   Fig. 3    Schematic drawing of the principle of SILAC. The cells are grown under different conditions in media containing different isotope compositions of hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen. The samples are then mixed
together. The duplex mixture can be fractionated by any protein separation method. After tryptic digestion of the protein fractions, the peptides are submitted to LC/MS for relative quantiﬁ  cation using the deﬁ  ned mass shifts of the related peptide peaks, and protein identiﬁ  cation        Christian Obermaier et al.
163the samples are denatured, reduced and alkylated prior to the label-ing reaction. The tagged samples are mixed in equal amounts and separated by electrophoretic or chromatographic techniques. Because all lysines are blocked by the ICPL labels, protein cleavage is ideally performed by double digest with trypsin and endopro-teinase GluC. This measure ensures improved sequence coverage. The use of Nic-NHS as a label enhances the ionization of the labeled peptides, and hence the sensitivity of mass spectrometry, which allows also the detection of low abundant proteins. Figure  4  shows a schematic drawing of the ICPL principle. The method is compatible with both MALDI and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, for quantiﬁ  cation with ICPL MS/MS is not required.   Fig. 4    Schematic drawing of the principle of ICPL.

164The evaluation software selects only the peptide peak sets with the deﬁ ned mass shifts of 0, 4, 6, and 10 showing differing expression levels. The ratios of peak intensities of the peptide pairs, triplets or quadruplets are used to determine the related protein abundances originating from the different samples. Analyzing quadruplets instead of triplets or doublets considerably reduces the number of false-positive multiplets, because randomly occurring sets with the four deﬁ  ned mass differences are considerably less frequent than sets with only two or three deﬁ  ned mass shifts ( see  also  Note 4  ). ICPL has the advantage, that it yields high sequence coverage, also when the complexity of the labeled samples has been reduced with high-resolution separation techniques. This feature is very impor-tant for adequate detection of post-translational modiﬁ  cations and
protein isoforms. It offers multiplex analysis of up to four samples, and it can be applied on any species, cell lysates, or tissue types.    4    Notes      1.    For optimum results, a sample cleanup based on protein pre-cipitation prior to labeling is recommended. It is essential for labeling, that the sample solution has a pH value between 8 and 9. In order to avoid any interference with the labeling procedure, the sample solution must not contain any primary amines, like carrier ampholytes, and reductant, like dithiothrei tol. These reagents are added after labeling has been completed.      2.    Saturation labeling is performed for one hour at a pH value of 8.0 and a temperature of 37 °C. Like with minimal labeling, the sample must not contain any carrier ampholytes and reduc-tant. Also here these compounds are added prior to application on the ﬁ  rst dimension.      3.    SERVA HPE™  Lightning Red   is compatible with all additives
typically used for sample solubilization and protein extraction, including carrier ampholytes and reductants like dithiothreitol (DTT) and dithioerythreitol (DTE). For efﬁ  cient labeling the pH value of the sample must be 8 or higher.      4.    The ICPL software cannot identify incomplete quadruplets, which sometimes occur due to the complete absence of a pro-tein in a    sample as a result of a complete down-regulation. It is therefore advised to prepare an internal standard, which is composed of equal amounts of all samples to be analyzed. This mixed sample is divided into four aliquots, which receive the four labels before they are combined again. The internal  standard is treated in the same way like the samples. This will create equally abundant quadruplets, which are used in the software data base for the detection and quantiﬁ  cation of incomplete quadruplets.         Christian Obermaier et al.

These membrane vesicles play multiple roles in cell-to-cell communication, including immune modulation, angiogenesis, and transformation of cells by transferring genetic material and func-tional proteins. They contain speciﬁ  c subsets of proteins, DNA, RNA, and lipids that represent their cel-lular status. Furthermore, extracellular vesicles are enriched in cell type- or disease-speciﬁ  c vesicular
proteins, especially plasma membrane proteins, which have pathophysiological functions; these vesicular proteins are considered novel diagnostic biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets. To proﬁ  le the proteome, various puriﬁ  cation methods of extracellular vesicles have been developed, but density gradient ultracen-trifugation is considered the most promising. In this chapter, we describe the isolation of extracellular vesicles derived from SW480 cells and the preparation of tryptic peptides for mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis.

Extracellular vesicles are spherical, lipid-bilayered structures containing various proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids [ 1 – 3 ].
Although they have long been considered cellular dust or artifacts from dead cells, recent research has revealed that extracellular ves-icles play various physiological and pathological roles, such as immune modulation, angiogenesis, and transformation of cells by transferring genetic material and functional proteins [ 1 ,  2 ]. It is known that cells release two types of extracellular vesicle: exosomes and ectosomes [ 1 ,  2 ]. Exosomes, 40–100 nm in diameter, are released via the fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane, followed by the discharge of intraluminal vesicles from the multivesicular bodies into the extracellular space. Ectosomes, also known as microvesicles, are 100–1,000 nm in diameter and
168shed directly from the plasma membrane. Despite the obvious  difference in their biogenesis mechanisms, discrete separation of exosomes and ectosomes is quite difﬁ  cult because of the few physi-cal differences between these two types of extracellular vesicle. Therefore, we describe the isolation of extracellular vesicles, includ-ing both exosomes and ectosomes, in this chapter.  Extracellular vesicles have unique characteristics, such as size, density, enriched molecules, and electrokinetic potential [ 4 – 6 ]. Therefore, based on these physical properties, various isolation methods, including ultracentrifugation, immunoafﬁ  nity capture, ﬂ  ow ﬁ eld-ﬂ  ow fractionation, and gel ﬁ  ltration, have been established for mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analyses of extracellular vesi-cles from cell culture media and various biological ﬂ  uids, including plasma, urine, and ascites [ 7 – 11 ]. Among the various puriﬁ  cation
methods, ultracentrifugation-based isolation has been applied widely because of its high yield, simplicity, and accessibility [ 3 ]. However, this method can cause misidentiﬁ  cation of non- vesicular proteins, because ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×  g  co- sediments non-vesicular contaminants, including non-speciﬁ  cally bound serum-abundant proteins on extracellular vesicles, apoptotic vesi-cles, protein aggregates, and high-molecular-weight protein complexes [ 2 ]. These non-vesicular contaminants cause an increase in the dynamic range of the proteome, reducing the number of vesicular proteins identiﬁ  ed by mass-spectrometry-based pro-teomic analysis [ 2 ]. To remove these contaminants, density gradi-ent ultracentrifugation based on sucrose or iodixanol is one of the best methods [ 12 ]. When compared with sucrose, iodixanol is more chemically stable and less viscous. Thus, we prefer iodixanol density gradient centrifugation to the more conventional sucrose
density gradient centrifugation [ 12 ].  Intraluminal proteins contained within extracellular vesicles are protected from denaturing agents (e.g., urea, thiourea, and guanidine hydrochloride) and proteases (e.g., trypsin) because of the lipid bilayer structure, which makes the vesicles impermeable to these reagents. Therefore, to identify the complete vesicular proteome, it is necessary to lyse the extracellular vesicles. Detergent (e.g., SDS, Triton X-100) can effectively lyse vesicles, but is difﬁ  -cult to remove from the sample. Detergent also causes deleterious effects, including compromised peptide separation in reversed- phase liquid chromatography and high noise in mass spectrometry. To overcome these problems, we employ methanol/chloroform precipitation, which effectively removes lipids and precipitates pro-teins [ 13 ]. In this chapter, we describe the puriﬁ  cation of extracel-lular vesicles derived from SW480 cells, a human colorectal cancer
cell line, using iodixanol buoyant density gradient centrifugation, delipidation using methanol/chloroform precipitation, and pro-tein digestion using trypsin for proteomic proﬁ  ling.  Dong-Sic Choi and Yong Song Gho

Prepare and store all reagents at 4 °C. All buf-fers should be passed through a 0.45 μm ﬁ lter. It is necessary to use sterile equipment if the ﬁ  nal use of the extracellular vesicles will require sterility (e.g., in vitro cell-based assays or in vivo animal experiments). In addition, puriﬁ  ed extracellular vesicles should be free of lipopolysaccharide contamination, especially for immunology- related experiments.       1.

9.    Transfer a total of 200 μL of the eluted sample to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.      10.    Vacuum dry or lyophilize the eluted sample.      11.    For reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, add 20 μL of 0.1 % formic acid in water, vortex, and centrifuge.        4    Notes      1.    To acquire the appropriate amount of isolated extracellular vesicles (>50 μg based on protein amount) for proteomics and other assays, it is necessary to use as many cells as possible (i.e., a minimum of 50, 150 mm culture plates, corresponding to ca. 1 × 10 9  cells). In addition, it is better to purify extracel-lular vesicles from large volumes of conditioned medium, because the loss of extracellular vesicles is decreased in large starting volumes.      2.    Serum contains lots of extracellular proteins at high concentra-
tions as well as serum-derived extracellular vesicles, which con-taminate cultured cells and the culture plate. Without careful washing, these components are co-puriﬁ  ed during isolation of extracellular vesicles. To entirely remove these contaminants, use PBS corresponding to 1.25-fold the volume of culture medium to wash the cells (e.g., 25 mL PBS and 20 mL culture medium in a 150 mm culture plate).      3.    Cell culture with serum-containing media can cause the co- puriﬁ cation of serum-abundant extracellular proteins and Dong-Sic Choi and Yong Song Gho
175serum-derived extracellular vesicles, which can lead to the identiﬁ  cation of serum-derived components at the expense of vesicular proteins because of the increased dynamic range of the sample. To overcome this problem, extracellular vesicle- depleted serum-containing media or serum-free media are used for proteomics analysis of extracellular vesicles. Despite the use of extracellular vesicle-depleted serum-containing media, however, plenty of serum-abundant extracellular pro-teins remain non-speciﬁ  cally bound to the puriﬁ  ed extracellu-lar vesicles. Therefore, we recommend the use of serum-free media alongside checking the viability of cells using an appro-priate assay (e.g., annexin V staining or the PARP apoptosis assay). Cell viability of ≥95 % is generally acceptable for pro-teomic analysis of extracellular vesicles. Cell culture in serum- free medium for >24 h can cause cell death and thus, generate
apoptotic vesicles, membrane fragments, and other cellular debris.      4.    Low-speed centrifugation will pellet dead cells, large mem-brane fragments, and cellular debris. It is recommended to use ﬁ xed-angle rotors for these steps. If swinging bucket rotors are used, the supernatant should be transferred to other centrifuge tubes using a pipet, leaving about 0.5-cm supernatant above the pellet.      5.    After conditioned medium is collected, it is strongly recom-mended that puriﬁ  cation of extracellular vesicles is conducted as soon as possible. Alternatively, it is possible to store condi-tioned medium at −80 °C after quick-freezing using liquid nitrogen, but this likely leads to breakdown of the extracellular vesicles.      6.    To determine the density of iodixanol density gradient frac-tions, it is necessary that control SW41 Ti ultracentrifuge tubes (containing the same iodixanol gradient without sample) are
co-centrifuged with the sample. Iodixanol can form self-gener-ating gradients during ultracentrifugation and thus, the densi-ties of iodixanol density gradient fractions are changed after ultracentrifugation ( see  Fig.  1a ).      7.    The extracellular vesicle-enriched fraction is determined by Western blotting for vesicular marker proteins, such as CD63 and CD81. Generally, extracellular vesicles are localized in the third fraction (density, ~1.096 g/mL) from the top ( see  Fig. 1a). To determine the enrichment of extracellular vesi-cles, the enriched fraction should be analyzed by electron microscopy, which is the gold standard method for visualizing extracellular vesicles ( see  Fig. 1b). Moreover, dynamic light scattering analysis and nanoparticle tracking analysis are used to determine the size distribution and particle concentration of extracellular vesicles ( see  Fig.  2a, b ). Dynamic light scattering Proteomics of Extracellular Vesicles
176analysis and nanoparticle tracking analysis have determined average diameters of SW480-derived extracellular vesicles of 176.70 ± 7.35 nm and 172.41 ± 16.42 nm, respectively. Nanoparticle tracking analysis also showed that the particle concentration is 7.56 ± 0.49 × 10 9  particles/ μg of total protein.       8.    Extracellular vesicles can be stored in the density gradient frac-tion at −80 °C as 100 μL aliquots after quick-freezing using liquid nitrogen. Avoid repeated freezing and thawing.      9.    Because extracellular vesicles have lipid bilayers, denaturing reagents, such as urea, thiourea, and guanidine hydrochloride, cannot access intraluminal proteins and trypsin cannot digest them. Methanol/chloroform precipitation can effectively remove lipids as well as precipitate proteins without salts. With this method, it is possible to precipitate ca. 2 μg protein, but it is recommended that >10 μg of vesicular protein be used in
methanol/chloroform precipitation for high yield.      10.    About 20 μg vesicular protein is enough to identify several hundred proteins without peptide fractionation (e.g.,  ion- exchange chromatography, isoelectric focusing) using reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. To identify more proteins using peptide frac-tionation, appropriate amounts of vesicular proteins should be prepared.      11.    Drying of the precipitated proteins for a long period results in difﬁ culty in complete re-solubilization in protein denaturation buffer.      12.    C18 spin columns can bind up to 30 μg of total peptide.         10 100 1000 100000102030Size (nm)a bNumber (%)10 100 1000 10000012345Size (nm)Concentration(1 x 106 particles/mL)  Fig. 2    Size distribution and particle concentration of puriﬁ  ed SW480-derived extracellular vesicles.

Greening, Rong  Xu, Hong  Ji, Bow  J. Tauro, and Richard  J. SimpsonAbstractExosomes are 40–150  nm extracellular vesicles that are released from a multitude of cell types, and  perform diverse cellular functions including intercellular communication, antigen presentation, and transfer of tumorigenic proteins, mRNA and miRNA.  Exosomes are important regulators of the cellular niche, and their altered characteristics in many diseases, such as cancer, suggest their importance for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, and as drug delivery vehicles. Exosomes have been purified from biological fluids
and in  vitro cell cultures using a variety of strategies and techniques. In this chapter, we reveal the protocol and key insights into the isolation, purification and characterization of exosomes, distinct from shed microvesicles and apoptotic blebs. Using the colorectal cancer cell line LIM1863 as a cell model, a com -prehensive evaluation of exosome isolation methods including ultracentrifugation (UC-Exos), OptiPrep™ density-based separation (DG-Exos), and immunoaffinity capture using anti-EpCAM-coated magnetic beads (IAC-Exos) were examined. All exosome isolation methodologies contained 40–150  nm vesicles based on electron microscopy, and positive for exosome markers (Alix, TSG101, HSP70) based on immu -noblotting. This protocol employed a proteomic profiling approach to characterize the protein composi -tion of exosomes, and label-free spectral counting to evaluate the effectiveness of each method in exosome
isolation. Based on the number of MS/MS spectra identified for exosome markers and proteins associated with their biogenesis, trafficking, and release, IAC-Exos was shown to be the most effective method to isolate exosomes. However, the use of density-based separation (DG-Exos) provides significant advantages for exosome isolation when the use of immunoaffinity capture is limited (due to antibody availability and suitability of exosome markers).Keywords  Exosome,  Protocol , Isolation, Purification, EpCAM, Immunoaffinity capture, Density, Proteomics, Extracellular vesicle, Shed microvesicles1 IntroductionAlmost all cells release different types of membrane microvesicles and nanovesicles, which have a variety of important physiological effects. Recently, evidence has emerged that cells naturally release extracellular vesicles (EVs), which convey critical information in
180the form of small RNAs, mRNAs, bioactive lipids, and proteins [1–3]. The protein content of different types of EVs mostly reflects that of the parent cells and vesicles are enriched in certain mole -cules, including components associated with adhesion, membrane trafficking, cytoskeleton molecules, heat shock proteins, cytoplas -mic enzymes, signal transduction proteins, cytokines, chemokines, proteinases, and cell-specific antigens [ 4–9]. Exosomes are a dis -crete population of small (40–150  nm diameter) membranous vesicles that are released into the extracellular space from multive -sicular bodies (MVBs) by most cell types [ 4]. Since their discovery over 30 years ago [ 10, 11], it has become clear that exosomes contribute to many aspects of physiology and disease, and for their important role in intercellular communication [ 6, 12–15]. Exoso -mes are important regulators of the cellular niche, and their alte -
red characteristics in many diseases, such as cancer, suggest their importance for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, and as drug delivery vehicles [ 16]. Despite recent advances in our under -standing of exosome biology [ 13, 17], much of this information has been obtained from heterogeneous or impure exosome prepa-rations, which have confounded interpretation of findings. For exam -ple, it is well known that eukaryotic cells release many membranous particle types into the microenvironment, these include exosomes, exosome-like microparticles, shedding microvesicles (sMVs) [ 6] or large oncosomes [ 18], apoptotic blebs (ABs) and gesicles [ 19]. Hence, there is an urgent need to better define exosome preparations so that information obtained at both protein and RNA levels can be appropriately interpreted with respect to unambiguous biological function. Likewise, it is important to accurately define homogeneous
exosome populations before embarking on large-scale production for the purpose of detailed biochemical analyses and/or preparation of clinical-grade reagents.Several strategies have been used for exosome isolation including ultracentrifugation, density gradient separation, and immunoaffinity capture. Our group recently performed a proteomic analysis evaluat -ing the ability of each of these techniques (namely ultracentri  fugation (UC-Exos), OptiPrep™ density gradient centrifugation (DG-Exos), and immunoisolation using EpCAM (CD326) antibodies coupled to magnetic beads (IAC-Exos)) to enrich for exosome markers and proteins involved in exosome biogenesis, trafficking, and release from LIM1863 cells (Figs.  1 and 2) [5]. Although exosomes pre -pared using all three isolation strategies contained 40–150  nm  vesicles positive for exosome markers Alix, TSG101, and HSP70 (Fig. 3a–c), GeLC-MS/MS combined with label-free spectral count -
ing revealed that immunoaffinity capture (IAC) enriched for exo -some and exosome-associated proteins by at least twofold more than the other two methods studied. To assess the three purification strat -egies we monitored the enrichment of several protein classes that have been inextricably associated with exosome biogenesis and/or David W. Greening et al.
181function—endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) and their associated proteins, Rab GTPases, tetraspanins, proteins implicated in intracellular trafficking, as well as proteins that may be involved in exosome internalization in a recipient cell (Table  1, Fig.  4). To enable this comparative enrichment assessment, we employed a proteomic label-free peptide spectral count strategy that entails summating the number of significant peptide MS/MS spectra for each individual protein, and normalizing them with respect to the total number of spectra identified in the given sample. The normalized ratios can then be compared between samples to estimate enrichment. Our findings indicate that IAC enabled the preparation of highly enriched exosomes compared to differential centrifugation and density gradient isolation methods.

The experimental workflow used for crude exosome
and shed microvesicle isolation. Cell media/supernatant or biofluids are processed by differential centrifuga -tion to remove intact cells and cell debris. The resulting supernatant can be processed immediately or stored (4 °C for up to 1 week, or −20  °C). Two different methods for isolation of crude exosomes are presented in this chapter and include: (1) concentrated culture medium (CCM) preparation, or (2) the isolation of shed microves -icles (sMVs) approach. For the CCM preparation (Subheading  3.1), the supernatant is filtered using a mem -brane 0.1  μm filter unit and concentrated to ~1.5  ml using centrifugal ultrafiltration (100K nominal molecular weight limit (NMWL) filters). The resulting CCM is further ultracentrifuged at 100,000  × g to obtain the crude exosome pellet. For isolation of sMVs (Subheadings  3.4–3.5), the culture medium is centrifuged at 10,000  × g
for 30  min, whereby the supernatant is ultracentrifuged at 100,000  × g to obtain the crude exosome pellet  (see Note 9 )Evaluation of Exosome Purification Methods
182use of density-based separation (DG-Exos) provides significant advantages for exosome isolation when the use of immunoaffinity capture is limited (due to availability/suitability of exosome mark -ers). We further provide a protocol for the isolation of shed microves -icles (sMVs) [ 6]. Exosomes are quite distinct from sMVs (heterogeneous 200–1,000  nm diameter vesicles) being shed from the PM into the extracellular space upon cellular activation by vari -ous stimuli [ 20]. Recently, we have isolated sMVs and two exosome populations (immunoaffinity isolated A33-exosomes and EpCAM-exosomes) and profiled miRNA signature from the three distinct EV subtypes [ 21].2 Materials 1.

For Western blotting (Subheading  3.8), each exosome preparation (10  μg) is separated by 1D-SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred, and probed with exosome markers Alix, HSP70, and TSG101.

For proteomic profiling of the three different methods for exosome purification, the distribution of identified proteins is shown in a three-way Venn diagram depicting number of proteins commonly observed in all three datasets (265), and proteins that are unique to each purification strategy ( a). The relative abundance of a protein (containing at least two significant peptides) within a sample was estimated using semi-quantitative normalized spectral count ratios ( Nsc, Eq. 1). For each individual protein, significant peptide MS/MS spectra were summated, and normalized by the total number of significant peptide MS/MS spectra identified in the sample. The ratio serves an indicator of protein abundance, i.e., the higher the ratio, the more abundant the protein within the sample.

MS sample vials with snap lid (Thermo Fisher Scientific).3 MethodsIn this methodology, two different approaches for isolation of crude exosomes are presented: (a) concentrated culture medium (CCM) preparation, and (b) the isolation of shed microvesicles (sMVs) approach (Fig.  1). 1. Human colon carcinoma LIM1863 cell organoids [ 22] are cultured in cell culture medium A with 10  % CO 2 at 37  °C  (see Notes 1  and 4).
(see Notes 1  and 4). 2. Wash LIM1863 cell organoids (~2  × 109 cells) four times with 30 ml of serum-free RPMI-1640 media (or sterile PBS can be used) and culture for 24  h in 750  ml cell culture medium B  (see Notes 3  and 5). Cell viability should be assessed in the presence of culture medium B ( see Note 6 ). 3. ~750  ml of culture medium (CM) is collected into 50  ml poly -propylene tubes and centrifuged at 4  °C (480  × g for 5  min  followed by 2,000  × g for 10  min) to remove intact cells and cell debris ( see Note 7 ). Note to retain the supernatant media and leave approximately half a centimetre of liquid above the pellet. Falcon tubes should not be reused at this stage ( see Note 8 ). This supernatant contains both soluble and membrane vesicle compo -nents ( see Note 9 ). 4. CM is filtered using a VacuCap® 60 filter unit fitted with a 0.1 μm Supor® Membrane. 5. CM concentrated to ~1.5  ml using an Amicon® Ultra-15,
Ultracel centrifugal filter device with a 100K NMWL (3,000  × g until 95  % of media has been filtered). Several centrifugal filter devices can be used for the same sample to increase efficiently of concentration, before combining retentate into one centrif -ugal filter for final concentration ( see Note 10 ).3.1 Cell Suspension Culture and  CCM PreparationDavid W. Greening et al.
193 6. CCM storage: Short-term on ice (within 3 days), long-term up to 6 months −20  °C. 1. Confluent cells are washed twice with ice cold PBS and lysed with 2  ml of SDS sample buffer for 10  min on ice. Cells are counted with a hemacytometer. 2. To remove DNA and insoluble cellular debris, lysates are centrifuged at 435,000  × g for 30  min (TLA-100.2 rotor), with supernatants collected and stored at −80  °C (up to 6 months). 1. Thaw a set of BSA standards, and store up to 2 weeks at 4  °C. 2. For Bradford assay of CCM : CCM should be placed on ice. 3. In a flat-bottom 96-well plate, load 10  μl of PBS in the first well (blank) and 10  μl of each standard BSA dilution in the eight following wells. 4. Load 6  μl of PBS to each well for CCM samples. 1. Place the Assay-free card(s) on the spotting tray. Select an appropriate buffer blank, preferably the same solution in which the protein has been prepared.
the protein has been prepared. 2. Pipette 2  μl of the buffer solution to the default blank position on the card (position 1). 3. Pipette 2  μl of sample to sample positions 2 through 4 as needed. Dry and insert card into reader. 4. Sample measurement/calibration. 1. 5 μl sample aliquots (CCM/WCL) are solubilized in SDS sam -ple buffer (10  μl), heated 95  °C for 5  min (closed cap), briefly centrifuged, and loaded on NuPAGE™ 4–12  % (w/v) Bis-Tris Precast gels. 2. 5 μl BenchMark™ Protein Ladder (1.7  μg/μl) is loaded into  a separate well on NuPAGE™ 4–12  % (w/v) Bis-Tris Precast gels for quantitation. Note that a blank lane should be retained for background subtraction. 3. Electrophoresis is performed at 150  V for 1  h in NuPAGE™ 1× MES running buffer. 4. After power off, the gel is removed from the tank and fixed in 50 ml fixing solution for 30  min on an orbital shaker and stained with 30  ml SYPRO® Ruby for 40  min, followed by
destaining in SYPRO® destaining solution for 1  h. 5. The gel is imaged on a Typhoon 9410 variable mode imager, using a green (532  nm) excitation laser and a 610BP30 emis -sion filter at 100  μm resolution.3.2 Whole Cell Lysate (WCL) Preparation3.3 Protein Quantitation  (See Note 11)3.3.1  Bradford Assay (BCA)3.3.2  Direct Detect Spectrometer3.3.3  Protein Staining DensitometryEvaluation of Exosome Purification Methods
194 6. Densitometry quantitation is performed using ImageQuant software to determine protein concentration relative to a BenchMark™ Protein Ladder standard of known protein con -centration (1.7  μg/μl), and normalized based on background subtraction. 1. For isolation of sMVs, the cell culture medium (CM) is centri -fuged at 4  °C (480  × g for 5  min followed by 2,000  × g for 10 min) to remove intact cells and cell debris. Separate tubes should be used following each centrifugation stage. 2. The CM is further centrifuged at 10,000  × g for 30  min to remove sMVs (Table  2, see Notes 2  and 13). 3. sMVs are resuspended in 1  ml of sterile/filtered PBS, before further centrifugation at 10,000  × g for 30  min to obtain the washed sMV pellet ( see Note 14 ). 4. sMV pellet can be resuspended in either SDS sample buffer (for PAGE analysis) or sterile/filtered PBS (EM imaging or functional studies). 1. CCM (500  μl, 1.5  mg protein) or CM-depleted with sMVs is
centrifuged at 100,000  × g (TLA-45 fixed angle) for 1  h at 4 °C (Table  2, see Notes 2  and 15). 2. Exosome pellet is resuspended in 1  ml sterile/filtered PBS and re-centrifuged (100,000  × g, 1 h) to obtain UC-Exos. 3. UC-Exos (~375  μg protein) are resuspended in 50  μl PBS and either used immediately or stored at −80  °C (see Note 16 ). 1. The CCM (500  μl, 1.5  mg protein) is overlaid on top of the discontinuous iodixanol gradient. The gradient is generated by diluting a stock solution of OptiPrep™ (60  % (w/v)) with 0.25 M sucrose, 10  mM Tris–HCl, pH  7.5 (40  % (w/v), 20  % (w/v), 10  % (w/v) and 5  % (w/v) solutions of iodixanol). These solutions are made immediately prior to centrifugation, and allow up to 30  min mixing time for each solution. The gradient was formed by adding 3  ml of 40  % iodixanol solu -tion, followed by careful layering of 3  ml each of 20  % and 10 % solutions, and 2  ml of the 5  % solution ( see Note 17 ).
2. This combined OptiPrep™ density solution is centrifuged at 100,000  × g (SW40Ti swinging bucket) for 18  h at 4  °C (Table  2, see Notes 2  and 15). 3. After centrifugation, 12 individual 1  ml gradient fractions are collected manually (with increasing density—top-bottom col -lection). A 1  ml pipet, and isolation from the meniscus is used for this careful procedure ( see Note 18 ).3.4 Shed Microvesicle (sMV) Isolation (See Note 12)3.5 Ultracentrifuga­tion Exosome (UC ­Exo) Isolation3.6 OptiPrep™ Density Gradient Exosome (DG ­Exo) IsolationDavid W. Greening et al.
195 4. Fractions are diluted with 2  ml PBS and centrifuged at 100,000  × g for 3  h at 4  °C followed by washing with 1  ml PBS, and re-suspension in 50  μl PBS. 5. To determine density of each fraction, a control OptiPrep™ gradient containing 500  μl of 0.25  M sucrose, 10  mM Tris–HCl, pH  7.5 should also be run in parallel. Fractions from the control should be collected as described in Subheading  3.6, step 3 , serially diluted 1:10,000 with distilled water, and the iodixanol concentration determined by absorbance at 244  nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 3,201  g−1 cm−1 [23]. 1. CCM (500  μl, 1.5  mg protein) is incubated with EpCAM-  microbeads (100  μl) for 4  h at 4  °C (see Note 20 ). 2. 3 ml LS Microcolumn placed in a solid support magnet (SSM) and rinsed three times with Rinsing Solution (MACS® BSA Stock Solution diluted 1:20 with autoMACS® Rinsing Solution). 3. Exosome-bound microbeads are pipetted into the column and
washed three times with 1  ml Rinsing Solution. 4. The LS column is removed from the SSM and exosome-bound microbeads recovered by rinsing the column at RT with 3 × 1 ml Rinsing Solution. 5. Exosome-bound microbeads are washed twice with 1  ml PBS, placed in ultracentrifuge microfuge vials, and centrifuged at 100,000  × g for 1  h at 4  °C (Table  2). 6. The supernatant is removed and IAC-Exos (yield ~195  μg) eluted from the microbeads with either 100  μl of 0.2  M gly -cine, Tris–HCl, pH  2.8 for EM imaging, or lysed with 100  μl of SDS sample buffer for PAGE analysis ( see Note 16 ). 1. Samples (~10  μg protein) are lysed in SDS sample buffer with 50 mM DTT and heated for 5  min at 95  °C (closed cap, although cap can be opened for evaporation to reduce load volume). 2. Electrophoresis is performed on lysed samples at constant 150 V for 1  h. 3. Following electrophoresis, proteins are electro-transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using iBlot™ Dry Blotting
System. 4. Membranes are blocked with 5  % (w/v) skim milk powder in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05  % (v/v) Tween-20 (TTBS) for 1 h at RT.  Care should be taken not to touch and disrupt the membrane (only the immediate corners/edges). 5. Membranes are probed with primary antibodies (anti-TSG101, anti-HSP70, anti-Alix) for 1  h in TTBS followed by incubation 3.7 EpCAM Immunoaffinity Capture Exosome (IAC­Exo) Isolation (See Note 19)3.8 Western Blot Analysis (See Note 21)Evaluation of Exosome Purification Methods
196with secondary antibody, IRDye 800 goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h in darkness. 6. All antibody incubations are carried out using gentle orbital shaking at RT. 7. Western blots are washed three times in TTBS for 10  min after each incubation step and subsequently visualized using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (800  nm). 1. Exosome preparations (~2  μg protein) are fixed in 1  % (v/v) glutaraldehyde, layered onto formvar-coated 200  mesh copper grids, and allowed to dry at RT. 2. Grids are washed twice with water for 5  min, and stained with 1 % (w/v) uranyl acetate in distilled water for 10  min. 3. Imaging is performed at an acceleration voltage of 200  kV using a Gatan UltraScan 1000 (2k  × 2k) CCD (charge-coupled device) camera coupled to a Tecnai F30 (FEI, Netherlands) electron microscope. 4. Typically 10–20 fields of view are obtained. 1. Exosome preparations (~2  μg protein) mixed with Aurion
Protein-  G gold 10  nm at 1:3 ratio. This will allow vesicle diam -eters to be determined and the possibility for tomographic data collection. 2. Samples are transferred onto glow-discharged C-flat holey car -bon grids and excess liquid blotted. Grids are immediately plunge-frozen in liquid ethane. 3. Grids mounted in a Gatan cryoholder in liquid nitrogen. 4. Images are acquired at 300  kV using a Tecnai G2 F30  in low dose mode. 5. Typically 10–20 fields of view are obtained. 1. Exosome samples (20  μg) lysed in SDS sample buffer, and pro -teins separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Imperial™ Protein Stain. 2. Individual gel lanes are placed on a clean glass plate and cut into equal slices (20  × 2 mm) using a GridCutter or clean scal -pel and individual gel slices subjected to in-gel reduction, alkylation, and trypsinization ( see Note 24 ). 3. For each band prepare a 1.5  ml microcentrifuge tube with 500 μl of 50  mM ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile (1/1).
4. Cut excised bands (spots) into cubes (ca. 1  × 1 mm if you used 1 mm thick gel) and transfer gel pieces carefully into low protein-  binding microcentrifuge tubes.3.9 Electron Microscopy (EM)  (See Notes 22 and  23)3.9.1  Transmi  ssion EM3.9.2  CryoEM3.10 Extraction, Reduction, AlkylationDavid W. Greening et al.
197 5. For sample reduction, microcentrifuge tubes are centrifuged briefly, heated using a thermomixer at 56  °C (700  rpm for 15 min), and the solution discarded. 200  μl acetonitrile is added and gel pieces should shrink and take an opaque-white color. Remove acetonitrile and let air-dry for 5  min in thermo -mixer at 56  °C. Add 50  μl fresh DTT solution and incubate at 56 °C for 30  min. 6. For sample alkylation set thermomixer to 22  °C and remove DTT solution completely. Immediately add 70  μl IAA solu -tion, incubate for 20  min in thermomixer at 22  °C (700  rpm) covered by aluminum foil. 7. The IAA solution is then removed, 300  μl acetonitrile added for 2  min, then removed. Add 100  μl of 50  mM ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile (1/1) and incubate for 30  min in thermomixer with light mixing at RT.  The sample should be lightly centrifuged and supernatant removed. 8. 300 μl acetonitrile is added to the samples, removed com -
pletely, and air dried for 5  min. 1. For tryptic digestion, add enough trypsin to cover the dry gel pieces (typically, 50–60  μl depending on gel volume). Store all samples immediately on ice. After 30  min, check if all solution is absorbed and add more trypsin, if necessary. Gel pieces should be completely covered with trypsin. 2. Leave gel pieces for another 30  min to saturate with trypsin and add 20  μl of 50  mM ammonium bicarbonate to cover the gel pieces. 3. Place tubes with gel pieces into the thermostat oven and incu -bate samples overnight at 37  °C. 4. Withdraw supernatants to low protein binding tubes, use a pipette with fine gel loader tip (re-use these tips for all follow -ing peptide collection steps). 5. Add extraction buffer (100  μl) to each tube and sonicate for 15 min. Collect supernatants into the corresponding tube. Repeat. 6. Dry down samples (covered with Vacufilm with four pin holes) in vacuum centrifuge for 15  min.
in vacuum centrifuge for 15  min. 7. For STAGE-Tip desalting, prepare as many desalting columns as necessary by punching out small disks [ 2, 3] of C18 Empore filter using a 22  G flat-tipped syringe and ejecting the disks into P200 pipette tips. Ensure that the disks are securely wedged in the bottom of the tip. Careful preparation of these STAGE-Tip devices will ensure effective filtration. 8. Condition columns by forcing methanol through (50  μl) and check whether the STAGE-Tips are leaky.3.11 Tryptic Digestion and STAGE ­Tip DesaltingEvaluation of Exosome Purification Methods
198 9. Remove any remaining organic solvent in the column by  forcing buffer A through the disk (×2) (40  μl). 10. Adjust pH of peptide sample to pH  < 2.5 using 2  % (v/v) TFA. 11. Force the acidified peptide sample through the C18-StageTip column. 12. Wash the column with buffer A.  Elute the peptides from the C18 material using 20–30  μl buffer B.  Elute directly into a microfuge tube or auto-sampler plate. Repeat elution. 13. Carefully dry samples in the speed-vac without heating, until all acetonitrile has evaporated (~2–3  μl final volume). Note to not completely overdry/dehydrate peptide sample due to issues with sample loss and resolubilization. 14. Mix the sample (1:1) with sample buffer up to 8  μl. 15. Withdraw to MS-specific vial for analysis (typically 3  μl loaded representing ~3.5–4  μg sample). To determine peptide con -centration a spectrophotometer analysis can be obtained based on 215  nm absorbance, and comparison with known standard.
standard. 16. Short-term storage at 4  °C (within 2 weeks), or long-term at −80 °C (up to 18 months). 1. RP-HPLC is performed on a nanoAcquity® (C18) 150  × 0.15-  mm i.d. reversed-phase UPLC column (Waters), using an Agilent 1200 HPLC, coupled online to an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source [ 24]. 2. RP-HPLC column is developed with a linear 60  min gradient with a flow rate of 0.8  μl/min at 45  °C from 0–100  % solvent B where solvent A was 0.1  % (v/v) aqueous formic acid and solvent B was 0.1  % (v/v) aqueous formic acid/60  % (v/v) acetonitrile. 3. Survey MS scans are acquired with the resolution set to a value of 30,000. Real-time recalibration is performed using a back -ground ion from ambient air in the C-trap [ 25]. 4. Up to five of selected target ions are dynamically excluded for 3 min. 1. Parameters used to generate peak lists, using Extract-MSn as part of Bioworks 3.3.1, include: minimum mass 700; maximum
mass 5,000; grouping tolerance 0  Da; intermediate scans 200; minimum group count 1; 10 peaks minimum and TIC of 100. 2. Peak lists for each LC-MS/MS run are merged into a single MGF file for Mascot searches. Automatic charge state recogni -tion is used due to the high resolution survey scan (30,000).3.12 MS/MS Analysis3.13 Database Searching and  Protein IdentificationDavid W. Greening et al.
199 3. LC-MS/MS spectra are searched against human protein sequence database (e.g., human RefSeq [ 26] protein database, 38,791 sequences) using Mascot (Matrix Science, UK). 4. Searching parameters include: fixed modification (carboxy -methylation of cysteine; +58  Da), variable modifications (oxi -dation of methionine; +16  Da), three missed tryptic cleavages, 20 ppm peptide mass tolerance and 0.8  Da fragment ion mass tolerance. 5. An MS/MS spectrum is deemed significant if its Mascot ion score is greater than its identity score. The Mascot ion score for an MS/MS match is based on the calculated probability ( P) that the observed match between the experimentally observed peptide and the database sequence is a random event. The reported score is −10  Log( P). Mascot derives an identity score for each peptide and protein; a score above that value indicates that the identification assigned has a user-defined probability (default setting of 97  %) of being correct [ 27].
6. Significant protein identifications contained at least two unique peptide identifications. The false-discovery rate (derived from corresponding decoy database search [ 28]) should be defined as being <1  %—for typical studies we define as <0.3  % for exo -some preparations. 7. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation is retrieved from the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) [ 29]. 8. Protein sequence analysis of exosome proteins is performed to identify significantly enriched domains/motifs using SMART [30]. 9. The transmembrane (TM) domain prediction tool TMHMM [31] is used to predict the presence of TM domains in the pro -tein sequences that were identified by MS. 10. Proteomic data from previous exosome studies can be down -loaded from ExoCarta ( http://www.exocarta.org ), an exo -some database containing all exosome proteins identified from multiple organisms. In addition, the extracellular vesicle data -base resources Vesiclepedia ( http://microvesicles.org ) and
EVPedia ( http://evpedia.info ) can be utilized ( see Note 25 ). 1. The relative abundance of a protein within a sample is esti -mated using semi-quantitative normalized spectral count ratios (Nsc). For each individual protein, significant peptide MS/MS spectra (i.e., ion score greater than identity score) are sum -mated, and normalized by the total number of significant MS/MS spectra identified in the sample (Eq.  1) Nn ft nfsc , =+() -+()/ (1)3.14 Label ­Free Spectral Counting  (See Note 26)Evaluation of Exosome Purification Methods

A correction factor is required to allow an Nsc value to be calculated when n = 0. 2. To compare relative protein abundance between samples the ratio of normalized spectral counts ( Rsc) is estimated (Eq.  2), as previously described [ 32] based on studies by [ 33, 34].

Cells should be grown to reach 70–80  % confluency for adher -ent cells, or 60–70  % of their maximum concentration for cells grown in suspension. The advantage of utilizing as many cells
as possible ensures a concentrated CM and enrichment of EVs. When washing adherent cells (typically 10  ml), the CM should be removed and replaced with exosome-production medium (Cell culture medium B, typically 20  ml). 2.

To isolate CM from adherent cells, the cell culture medium should be collected under sterile conditions and transferred to 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes. CM should be centri -fuged at 480  × g for 5  min (the supernatant transferred using a pipette to a separate 50  ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes) and 2,000  × g for 10  min. The supernatant is collected using a
pipette and stored at 4  °C. To isolate CM from cell suspen -sions, the cell culture medium should be collected under sterile conditions and transferred to 50  ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes. CM should be initially centrifuged at 5  min at 200–400 × g, 4 °C, before following the protocol for adherent cells (480 × g, 5 min and 2,000  × g, 10 min).David W. Greening et al.
201 4. For large-scale exosome and microvesicle preparation, we have employed the use of the two-compartment bioreactor CELLine tank system to achieving continuous culture and high EV yields (in mg quantities). This is attained by separating the bio -reactor into a medium compartment and a cell compartment. CELLine does not require any specific adaptation of cell cul -ture techniques or media composition and is suitable for appli -cations based on serum-supplemented or serum free cultures. We have utilized both CELLine classic  (CELLine CL 1000, #90005, INTEGRA Biosciences) and CELLine adhere  (CELLine AD 1000, #90025) for suspension or anchorage-  dependent cells to be grown in the bioreactor and extensive EV yields generated. By combining high product and cell con -centration with recurring culture medium collection, large amounts (mg quantities) of highly concentrated secreted pro -teins and EVs are routinely obtained in CELLine systems [ 21].
We would recommend washing the cell compartment (every second day, 3-washes in media) to remove poorly adherent, nonviable cells/dead cells/debris before addition of fresh FCS supplemented medium to both compartments. It has been reported that CELLine culture system for exosome produc -tion from tumor cell cultures significantly increased exosome yield ~12 fold than conventional flasks to ~10.1  μg/ml [ 35]. In addition, morphology, phenotype and function of these exosomes was confirmed, and shown to be identical to tradi -tional flask culture methods. 5. Standard growth medium for most cells in culture require fetal bovine serum (FBS) as a growth supplement to DMEM/RPMI.  FBS is derived from bovine (cow) serum and contains a high abundance of cow-derived exosome vesicles. These exo -somes can interfere or cause significant protein background issues when studying exosomes secreted from cells of interest in standard culture conditions. For exosome production, we
typically modify the growth medium either serum-free media (SFM) or a combination of SFM and Insulin Transferrin-  Selenium (ITS, 0.2–0.6  % (w/v)) (i.e., culture medium B) to ensure cells remain viable during exosome production. Any changes to cell growth medium supplements should be evalu -ated over the time-course of exosome-production (typically 24–48  h). Further methods to modify the cell growth medium (although still the possibility of bovine secreted proteins) include, 1  % (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) added instead of FBS, and depletion of FCS-containing exosomes based on ultracentrifugation (100,000  × g, 18 h), or filtration/immuno -depletion (CD63 positive, exosome-sized vesicles removed, no measureable bovine microRNAs). This exosome-depleted FBS growth supplement (Exo-FBS) is commercially available (EXO-FBS-250A-1, System Biosciences).Evaluation of Exosome Purification Methods
202 6. To monitor cell viability in the presence of exosome-  production medium (culture medium B) a Trypan Blue dye assay should be performed. Dilute cell sample in Trypan Blue dye by pre -paring a 1:1 dilution of the cell suspension using a 0.4  % (w/v) Trypan Blue solution. Trypan Blue should be sterile filtered (0.22  μm) in order to remove particles in the solution that would disturb counting. Carefully and continuously fill the hemocytometer chamber and incubate for 1  min at RT.  Count cells under the microscope in four 1  × 1 mm squares of one chamber and determine the average number of cells per square (all hemocytometers consist of two chambers, each is divided into nine 1  mm2 squares). For an accurate determination, the total number of cells overlying one 1  mm2 should be between 20–50 cells/square. If the cell density is >200 cells/square, the cell suspension should be diluted accordingly. Nonviable cells
will stain blue, viable cells will be unstained, and this difference should be used to calculate cell viability. 7. For sample and exosome sterility, it is only necessary to use sterile conditions if the final use of exosomes is going to require sterility (e.g., functional in  vivo or in  vitro assays). If only bio -chemical analyses will be performed (e.g., immunoblot, pro -teomics, RNA), very clean, but not necessarily sterile, tubes are required. The use of filtered and sterile PBS is often used to ensure no contaminants are included during preparation and solubilization. If sterility is required, sterile centrifuge and ultracentrifuge tubes must be used, with centrifuge tube hold -ers and all related steps must be performed in an enclosed tis -sue culture hood. To sterilize ultracentrifuge tubes, wash the clean tubes and their lids briefly in 70  % (v/v) ethanol, rinse twice in sterile PBS, and remove PBS.  All rotor lids and caps,
centrifugal ultrafilter units should also be washed with 70  % ethanol (depending on compatibility with filter membranes, check with manufacturer requirements). 8. All centrifugations for sample preparation and exosome isola -tion and purification should be performed at 4  °C. Tubes should be weighed with sample to ensure weight distribution is equal during centrifugation. 9. Given that there are a diverse membrane vesicles of endosomal and plasma membrane origin (exosomes, microvesicles/sMVs, apoptotic bodies, etc.) throughout the extracellular environ -ment [ 3], it is important to define which vesicle type research -ers intend to isolate. In the context of exosomes, we have provided two different methods for the isolation of crude exo -somes, including filtration-based/CCM, and isolation of sMVs using ultracentrifugation (Fig.  1). The selection of which method for exosome isolation is dependent on several factors including:David W. Greening et al.
203 (a) Availability of large-scale instruments and centrifuges (due to the concentration of exosomes in culture medium), large cul -ture volumes (>500–1,000  ml) are often utilized in order to generate exosome yields for characterization/functional stud -ies. This introduces issues with the capacity of centrifugation, availability (rotors, instrumentation), and time. If researchers are limited by large-scale ultracentrifugation, then the CCM preparation approach would be suggested. (b) Exosome yield (typically exosome yields are much greater (>25–30  %, data not shown) using the sMV approach due to the absence of membrane filters (0.1  μm) which can perturb exosome isolation), however this approach requires the use of ultracentrifugation (often large-scale use) see point (a) above. (c) Requirement to isolate sMVs for analysis (using the CCM preparation vesicles >0.1  μm are not retained and therefore restricting their subsequent analysis). If researchers are inter -
ested in the isolation of sMVs, then this fraction can be easily isolated from culture medium in the process of obtaining the crude exosome pellet. 10. A wide range of centrifugal filters are commercially available for concentrating and filtrating protein solutions, removing small solutes, and/or buffer exchanging. Vertical or angular membrane configurations reduce concentration polarization (membrane fouling) and allow high flow rates for optimal sol -vent passage even with high proteinaceous solutions [ 24, 36]. Note that low-protein binding filter membranes should be uti -lized (i.e., Amicon Ultra-15 which utilize a Ultracel regener -ated cellulose membrane and compatible with 70  % (v/v) ethanol-based sterilization). 11. For protein quantitation we typically employ different meth -ods based on sample quantity and buffer compatibility, includ -ing the Bradford assay (10  μl sample), protein densitometry (5 μl sample), or Direct Detect Spectrometer (2  μl sample).
For samples employing detergents, or other reagents which will affect absorbance we would recommend using the protein densitometry method. The protein densitometry method is reproducible, has a linear quantitation range over three orders of magnitude [ 37], and is compatible with GeLC-MS/MS [6, 9, 38]. Please note that SYPRO® Ruby fluorescent protein stain and a variable mode imager, using a green (532  nm) exci -tation laser and a 610BP30 emission filter are required for the protein densitometry method. The Direct Detect Spectrometer (DDHW00010-WW, Merck Millipore) is based on infrared quantification, where samples are applied directly to a card-based hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene membrane, measur -ing amide bonds in protein chains. Protein concentrations Evaluation of Exosome Purification Methods
204from 0.2 to 5  mg/ml can accurately be determined. Buffers containing more than 5  % (w/v) glycerol, SDS, and/or Tween surfactant should be avoided due to the excessive time required to achieve dryness. It is important to perform protein quanti -fication on exosome/sMV/WCL samples prior to immunob -lotting, or proteomic profiling. 12. For the isolation of sMVs, a direct ultracentrifugation approach is employed. sMVs are distinct heterogeneous 200–1,000  nm diameter vesicles being shed from the plasma membrane into the extracellular space upon cellular activation by various stim -uli [20]. Following 10,000  × g centrifugation, the sMV pellet is resuspended in 1  ml of PBS and 10,000  × g centrifugation per -formed to obtain the washed sMV fraction (resuspended in 100 μl PBS). The isolation and proteomic characterization of sMVs has been described previously [ 6]. 13. For ultracentrifugation, note to mark each ultracentrifuge tube
and orient the tube in the rotor with the mark facing up. The mark should be used a reference for location of a pellet follow -ing centrifugation. For swinging-bucket rotors, the pellet is at the bottom of the tube. For fixed-angle rotors, the pellet is on the side of the tube near the base. 14. For supernatant removal following ultracentrifugation, for fixed-angle rotors, pour the supernatant rather than use a pipet. For swinging-bucket rotors, remove supernatant with pipet and leave 2  mm of supernatant above the pellet. 15. The ultracentrifuge tubes are thin walled and will collapse if improperly filled. All tubes should be at least 80  % capacity to ensure the tube is not flexible. Tube specifications should be checked with the manufacturer prior to use. Note to add addi -tional PBS if required. Ensure that the rotor is properly seated within the centrifuge. 16. The stability of exosomes has been examined during storage at
−20, 4, and 37  °C [39]. The size of the exosomes was shown to decrease at 4  °C (3–4 days) and 37  °C (from 2 days), indi -cating a possible structural change or degradation. Multiple freezing to −20  °C and thawing did not affect exosome size based on nanoparticle tracking analysis. In our studies, exo -some degradation has been monitored at 4  °C (within 72  h) and 37  °C (within 24  h) (data not shown). Recommend to store exosomes at 4  °C on ice for short-term use (within 3 days), and for long periods at either −20  °C/−80  °C or lyophi -lization (over 12 months at 4  °C). Exosome/sMV samples should be stored in small (50–100  μl) aliquots to avoid repeated freezing and thawing. 17. Exosomes have been shown to float at densities ranging from 1.09–1.15  g/ml on continuous sucrose or iodixanol density David W. Greening et al.
205gradient following centrifugation [ 5, 8, 9]. OptiPrep™  velocity gradients have low viscosity, isoosmotic gradients that provide rapid and efficient separation of extracellular vesicles. OptiPrep™ velocity gradients have been shown to efficiently separate exosomes from HIV-1 particles [ 40]. 18. Following OptiPrep™ density gradient, isolated protein frac -tions (in this case 12 fractions) can be assessed for density (e.g., range 1.01–1.30  g/ml), and protein yield by staining with SYPRO® Ruby, and assessing expression of exosomal markers using immunoblot analysis. As an example, OptiPrep™ density gradient fractions (10  μg) revealed exosomal marker Alix predominantly detected in fraction 1.11  g/ml (fraction 7) (Fig. 3d/e). 19. The availability and suitability of exosome markers for immu -noaffinity capture is dependent on their target specificity and application. Currently, several markers for exosomes have been
used for immunoaffinity capture including Glycoprotein A33+ exosomes derived from human epithelial colon cancer cells [41], EpCAM+ exosomes derived from human epithelial colon cancer cells [ 5], sequential Glycoprotein A33+ and EpCAM+ exosomes from human epithelial colon cancer cells to reveal specific subpopulations of exosomes [ 6], MHC II+ exosomes derived from dendritic cells [ 42], HER2+ exosomes derived from BT-474 breast cancer cells [ 43], and CD45+ exosomes derived from Jurkat and SupT1/CCR5 cells [ 44]. Commercially, Dynabeads®-based CD63-specific reagent (#10606D, Life Technologies) and streptavidin reagent with choice of a biotinylated antibody to purify a specific vesicle population based on a surface antigen (#10608D, Life Technologies) are available. The use of density-based separa -tion (DG-Exos, Fig.  2b) provides significant advantages for exosome isolation when the use of immunoaffinity capture is
limited (due to availability/suitability of exosome markers). 20. CD326 (EpCAM)  + exosomes are bound with EpCAM MicroBeads, with the CM loaded onto a MACS® Column which is placed in the magnetic field of a MACS Separator (SSM). The magnetically labeled EpCAM+ exosomes are retained within the column. The EpCAM-vesicles are parsed through; this fraction is depleted of EpCAM+ exosomes. After removing the column from the magnetic field, the magnetically retained EpCAM+ exosomes are eluted as the positively selected exosome fraction. For this application, 100 μl of CD326 (EpCAM) MicroBeads were used for 500 ml CM (1.5  mg CCM) generated from 2  × 109 cells. Working on ice may require increased incubation times. Higher temperatures and/or longer incubation times may lead to nonspecific vesicle binding.Evaluation of Exosome Purification Methods
206 21. To characterize extracellular vesicles as exosomes, it is  important to demonstrate the expression of common exosomal proteins using immunoblotting. The commonly used markers are: Alix (PDCD6IP, programmed cell death 6 interacting protein), TSG101 (tumor susceptibility gene 101), CD63 (tetraspanin CD63), CD81 (tetraspanin CD81), and Hsp70 (heat shock protein 70). 22. Exosomes that have been purified should be used to obtain high-quality electron micrographs without storage at either −20 or −80  °C. Note that EM should be performed within 1 week of exosome purification. 23. We provide two methods (TEM and cryoEM) for electron microscopy exosome sample preparation. For TEM analysis, exosomes are fixed using glutaraldehyde and negatively stained using uranyl acetate. This approach typically has a rapid sample preparation approach (<20  min) although provides exosome images of low resolution. Significant shortcomings being that
the sample preparation steps and imaging techniques require dehydration, chemical fixation and/or staining of the biologi -cal specimens. This has the potential to under-  represent the diameter of vesicles due to dehydration and chemical fixation. In contrast, cryoEM does not use staining or chemical fixation procedures and samples are directly applied onto an EM grid, vitrified and visualized. Vitrification is a cryo-fixation method to preserve biological specimens to near-atomic resolution [45], while water is transformed into a glass-like state without formation of ice crystals. CryoEM of vitrified whole cells or EVs enables observation of biological structures in a near-native state [ 46, 47]. Further, cryoEM allows tomographic data collection and the ability for spatial visualization of more complex structures. Therefore, cryoEM has the capacity to reveal highly textured EVs and exosomes. 24. In this chapter, although individual gel lanes were cut into
equal slices (20  × 2 mm), more conventional high resolution mass spectrometers can utilize more complex, unfractionated (or limited fractionation) samples. For this reason we typically employ a short range gel (<5  mm, or 6  min at 150  V) and use a clean scalpel to cut the single individual gel slice for reduc -tion, alkylation, and tryptic digestion. 25. Databases for extracellular vesicle (Vesiclepedia: http://microvesicles.org ) (EVPedia: http://evpedia.info ) and exo -somes (ExoCarta: http://www.exocarta.org ) are manually curated databases of proteins, RNA, and lipids. These databases are an excellent resource for investigators, however several key limitations have been discussed about their utility. The primary issue is terminologies used in naming EVs, and then categoriz -ing specific isolated EVs into a standardized nomenclature. David W. Greening et al.
207In addition, various studies employ differences in their purifica -tion and characterization, which inevitably introduces and potentially confounds interpretation of biochemical data. 26. In this chapter, label-free proteomic quantification was employed based on spectral counting (SpC). SpC counts the number of spectra identified for a given peptide in different  biological samples and then integrates the results for all mea -sured peptides of the protein(s) that are quantified [ 48]. SpC has become a commonly used approach for measuring protein abundance in label-free shotgun proteomics.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported, in part, by the National Health & Medical Research Council of Australia (program grant #487922 (RJS), project grant #1057741 RJS).Conflict of interest : The authors declare no conflict of interest.References 1.

Bayer    ,     Simon     Stael    , and     Markus     Teige        Abstract    Detailed knowledge of the proteome is crucial to advance the biological sciences. Low-abundant proteins are of particular interest to many biologists as they include, for example those proteins involved in signal transduction. Recent technological advances resulted in a tremendous increase in protein identiﬁ  cation sensitivity by mass spectrometry (MS). However, the dynamic range in protein abundance still forms a fundamental problem that limits the detection of low-abundant proteins in complex proteomes. These
proteins will typically escape detection in shotgun MS experiments due to the presence of other proteins at an abundance several-fold higher in order of magnitude. Therefore, speciﬁ  c enrichment strategies are required to overcome this technical limitation of MS-based protein discovery. We have searched for novel signal transduction proteins, more speciﬁ  cally kinases and calcium-binding proteins, and here we describe different approaches for enrichment of these low-abundant proteins from isolated chloroplasts from pea and Arabidopsis for subsequent proteomic analysis by MS. These approaches could be extended to include other signal transduction proteins and target different organelles.

ogy over the last years due to several aspects: Organelles perform key activities for cellular metabolism and provide the basis for growth and production of valuable compounds [ 1 ]. Moreover, the use of isolated organelles as starting material does already signiﬁ  -cantly reduce the complexity of the sample as compared to total cell extracts. However, in the case of leaves the difference between isolated chloroplasts and total leaves becomes rather small in terms of their overall protein composition, thus calling for additional enrichment strategies for the identiﬁ  cation of low-abundant
212proteins such as signaling components. With the notion that  organelles are increasingly being seen as important signal transduc-tion hubs in the cell, for example in retrograde signaling, oxidative stress signaling, hormone signaling and defense response [ 2 – 4 ], this latter aspect becomes more and more important.  The study of chloroplasts, as a central organelle to these path-ways and speciﬁ  c to plants, has strong implications for agricultural research and consequently, chloroplast proteomics from a number of different plant species has gained a lot of attention during the last decade [ 5 – 8 ]. However, despite all efforts, the knowledge of regulatory components in chloroplasts such as protein kinases is still very limited [ 9 ], underpinning the need for application of spe-ciﬁ cally targeted enrichment strategies [ 10 ]. This is even more important as it turned out that particularly for those components
the application of prediction algorithms, which are based on the genome sequence, is strongly biased [ 10 ].  Traditionally, highly pure and intact chloroplasts used for func-tional studies and protein import experiments were obtained from  Spinacia oleracea   or  Pisum sativum  . Since their genomes have not been sequenced, chloroplast isolation protocols were later on also adapted for  Arabidopsis thaliana  . Our chloroplast isolation proto-col from Arabidopsis is based on the method from Kunst [ 11 ], which yields reasonable amounts of intact chloroplasts with stro-mal content sufﬁ  cient for downstream puriﬁ  cation steps and/or analyses. To circumvent the labor-intensive isolation of Arabidopsis chloroplasts for mass spectrometry-based proteomic approaches, the isolation of chloroplasts from pea provides a useful alternative, since the release of an expressed sequence tag (EST) database, which could be used for protein identiﬁ  cation [ 12 ]. Therefore, we
describe both methods here.  The chloroplast proteome can further be divided into several sub-compartments: (1) the soluble part, the chloroplast stroma; (2) the thylakoid membrane, and (3) the chloroplast envelope membrane. As for the latter two recently proteomics protocols have been published [ 13 ,  14 ], we focus here exclusively on the stromal proteins, which become easily accessible after osmotic dis-ruption of isolated chloroplasts. A general ﬂ  ow-scheme of our experimental strategy is displayed in Fig.  1 . After extraction of stro-mal proteins we perform a size exclusion chromatography to remove the highly abundant Rubisco protein complex (~540 kDa) which generally presents the biggest problem for MS-based identi-ﬁ cation of low-abundant proteins. In addition, also ribosomes are removed during this step. Subsequently, after size exclusion chro-matography, all fractions of interest can be pooled and either
directly be subjected to mass spectrometry or to downstream  puriﬁ cation approaches (i.e., afﬁ  nity chromatography) in order to further reduce the sample complexity.   Roman G. Bayer et al.

217   4.    Remove broken chloroplasts on top of the 40 % Percoll layer with a vacuum pump together with excess 40 % Percoll layer but leave some of the 40 % Percoll on the 40–80 % interphase, not to expose intact chloroplasts to air, while recovering them.      5.    Recover intact chloroplasts after centrifugation from the 40–80 % interphase and transfer them into two 50 ml tubes.      6.    Wash the isolated chloroplasts with ~30 ml P-WASH buffer and precipitate by centrifugation for 2 min at 2,800 ×  g  (brake “on”).      For use of the chloroplasts in protein import experiments, the washing step should be repeated. Finally, re-suspend the pellets in ~500 μl P-WASH buffer; pool, and either use directly for further analysis ( see   Notes 4  ,  5  and  8 ) or freeze in liquid nitrogen for stor-age at −80 °C ( see   Note 11  ). Do not forget to take a sample for chlorophyll content estimation ( see  Subheading  3.3 ).
The experimental procedure for the isolation of chloroplasts from Arabidopsis was adapted from the protocol of Kunst [ 11 ]. Prepare Percoll gradients prior to the harvesting of leaves!    1.    Cut ~90 g of leaves and homogenize them in 500 ml of homog-enization buffer (HB buffer) using a Waring blender and three pulses: low–low–high, 2–3 s each ( see   Notes 3   and  7 ).      2.    Filter the homogenate through four layers of Miracloth into one GS3 tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 1,519 ×  g  (brake “on”).      3.    Gently re-suspend the pellet in 20 ml 1× re-suspension buffer (RB buffer) using a ﬁ  ne paintbrush and distribute the chloro-plast suspension to the four preformed Percoll gradients ( see   Notes 8   and  9 ), 5 ml on top of each, using a pipette.      4.    Centrifuge for 6 min at ~10,700 ×  g  (brake “slow”), recover intact chloroplasts (lower green band of each gradient) and transfer them into two 50 ml tubes ( see   Note 9  ). Take care not
to touch the pellet of the tube containing starch granules.      5.    Wash the chloroplasts with 1× RB buffer by centrifugation for 3 min at 1,700 ×  g  (brake “on”) and discard the supernatant. Re-suspend each pellet in ~300 μl 1× RB buffer, pool the  isolated chloroplasts, and immediately freeze them in liquid nitrogen and store at −80 °C ( see   Note 10  ). Do not forget to take a sample for chlorophyll content estimation ( see  Subheading  3.3 ).              1.    Mix 5 μl isolated chloroplast suspension with 5 ml 80 % ace-tone and centrifugate for 2 min at 3,000 ×  g . Subsequently, measure the OD 645  and OD 663  of the supernatant (using glass or quartz cuvettes) and determine chlorophyll concentration using the following formula ( see   Note 11  ):     3.2  Chloroplast Isolation from Arabidopsis thaliana  ( See   Note 6 )3.3  Estimation of the Chlorophyll Content of Isolated Chloroplasts

Incubate chloroplasts (amount equivalent to ~20 mg of chlo-rophyll) in ~1.5 volumes of hypotonic osmotic lysis buffer for 5 min on ice to achieve osmolytic bursting of the envelopes.      2.    Centrifuge for 6 min at 12,000 ×  g  at 4 °C and transfer the supernatant containing the stromal content to a 50 ml tube.      3.    Re-suspend the chloroplast pellet in ~5 ml osmotic lysis buffer and repeat the extraction step once.      4.    Pool the stromal protein extracts and keep on ice until further treatment.      The thylakoid pellet can be re-suspended in ~5 ml THY buffer and stored at −80 °C for future usage.        1.    Prior to the size exclusion chromatography (SEC), exchange the buffer of the stromal protein extracts to buffer S200-A on PD-10 Desalting columns according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2.    Concentrate the protein solution to a volume of ~500 μl using Centriprep Centrifugal Filter Units.      3.    Clear the extract by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,100 ×  g  and 4 °C, and apply the supernatant to an S200 gel ﬁ  ltration column.      4.    Perform size exclusion chromatography on an FPLC system at a ﬂ ow rate of 0.8 ml/min using the S200-A as running buffer, fractionate the eluate and store at 4 °C until further treatment.      The protein content of the eluting fractions can be determined, for example by photometry (e.g., measuring OD 280 ) or by SDS- PAGE after TCA precipitation (using a standard protocol). Functional assays such as in vitro protein kinase assays can also be easily performed on the protein fractions.        1.    Pool the fractions of interest from the S200 gel ﬁ  ltration and concentrate them to a volume of ~500 μl using a Centriprep Centrifugal Filter Unit (NMWL: 10 kDa). After clariﬁ  cation
by centrifugation for 3 min at 16,100 ×  g  and 4 °C apply the supernatant to a S75 gel ﬁ  ltration column and perform size exclusion chromatography on an FPLC system at a ﬂ  ow rate of 0.4 ml/min using solution S200-A as running buffer. Fractionate the eluate and conduct protein content measure-ments and/or functional assays as desired.

Perform ion exchange chromatography on an FPLC system at a ﬂ ow rate of 2 ml/min.      4.    Elute proteins by applying a linear gradient over ﬁ  ve column volumes (CV) of buffer B from 0 to 100 % (MQ-B for MonoQ and MS-B for MonoS column, respectively).      5.    Fractionate the eluate and conduct protein content measure-ments and/or functional assays as desired. Store protein sam-ples at 4 °C until further treatment.            1.    Buffer exchange the protein extract of interest to PS-B buffer using PD-10 Desalting columns according to the manufac-turer’s instructions.      2.    Concentrate the sample to a volume of ~500 μl using a
Centriprep Centrifugal Filter Unit, clear by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,100 ×  g  at 4 °C, and apply the supernatant to a Phenyl-Superose column.      3.    Perform hydrophobic interaction chromatography on an FPLC system at a ﬂ  ow rate of 2 ml/min and elute proteins by applying a gradient of PS-B and PS-A buffer. Fractionate the eluate and conduct protein content measurements and/or functional assays as desired. Store protein samples at 4 °C until further treatment.            1.    Equilibrate ATP or PurB column with ten column volumes (CV) of ATP buffer or PurB buffer, respectively.      2.    Pool the protein extracts of interest (e.g., eluates from size exclusion or ion exchange chromatography; amount equiva-lent up to ~1.5 mg protein) and adjust the ionic content to ATP buffer or PurB buffer by dilution with an appropriate stock solution, and apply the sample to the column.      3.    Wash the column with 20 CV of ATP buffer or PurB buffer
and elute bound proteins with 6 CV of 0.5 % SDS.      4.    Fractionate the eluate and analyze, for example by SDS-PAGE after TCA precipitation.      Regions of interest on the protein gel (e.g., after Coomassie or silver staining) can subsequently be excised and subjected to MS analysis.  3.7  Ion Exchange Chromatography—MonoQ/MonoS3.8  Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC)—On Phenyl-Superose3.9  ATP/Purvalanol B Afﬁ  nity ChromatographyChloroplast Isolation and Afﬁ  nity Chromatography
220  Some small proteins like calmodulins are particularly resistant to heat treatment, which allows a rapid and easy enrichment from complex protein mixtures, because larger proteins will typically denature upon heating and precipitate after centrifugation.    1.    Lyse 3 ml isolated chloroplasts (containing ~4 mg/ml chloro-phyll) by addition of 7 ml of chloroplast lysis buffer and incu-bate for 10 min on ice.      2.    Divide the chloroplast suspension into 1 ml aliquots and heat rapidly to 75 °C for 5 min on a heat block, and immediately cool on ice.      3.    Pellet the heat-denatured proteins and thylakoid membranes by centrifugation at 20,000 ×  g  for 10 min.      4.    Clear the supernatant further by another centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 ×  g  at 4 °C.        Ca 2+  binding proteins can be enriched by afﬁ  nity chromatography on immobilized Eu 3+  ions using an iminodiacetic acid (IDA) col-
umn. This method has previously been described by Chaga et al. [ 18 ], and was adapted to chloroplast proteins. Protein obtained from chloroplast stroma SEC or from heat-treated isolated chloro-plasts was loaded on the column.    1.    For heat-treated samples, re-buffer the sample to IDA column- loading buffer, using PD-10 desalting columns. For SEC frac-tionated stroma extracts, add salts to the extracts to match the composition of the IDA column-loading buffer.      2.    After sample loading, wash the column with 10 ml equilibration buffer, 5 ml of sulfate buffer, and 2.5 ml of malonate buffer.      3.    Elute proteins with citrate buffer. Finally, strip the column with 100 mM EDTA.      For further use, exchange the buffers of the citrate eluate and EDTA-strip to 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5 on a PD-10 column and precipitate proteins by addition of four volumes of ice-cold ace-tone. Proteins can now be subjected to SDS-PAGE, visualized by
silver staining and bands of interest can be excised for subsequent MS analysis.   4    Notes      1.    Starch granules in the chloroplast will contribute to breaking of chloroplasts during handling. Therefore prepare chloro-plasts in the morning, when starch levels in the chloroplast are lowest.      2.    No titration necessary. Optimal pH is reached by mixing the two buffer components (MOPS and Tris).   3.10  Heat Treatment of Isolated Chloroplasts and Protein Extraction3.11  Eu 3+ -IDA Column Afﬁ  nity ChromatographyRoman G.

221   3.    To gain better yields of intact chloroplasts and to allow a shorter and more gentle homogenization the blades of the Waring blender should be as sharp a possible (can usually be detached for sharpening).      4.    Add isoascorbate and glutathione always freshly prior to use and readjust pH to 8.4 with KOH.      5.    Isolation of chloroplasts requires a certain amount of practice in order to achieve reproducible results and an optimal yield in terms of intact organelles. However, based on empirical expe-rience there is a natural variation and sometimes the yield of intact chloroplasts is much lower than expected although the plants have been grown under the same conditions and the same technical procedures have been followed.      6.    Carry out all steps at 4 °C (in a cooling chamber or on ice).      7.    If the homogenization appears to be a problem, younger plant material should be used.
material should be used.      8.    When pipetting chloroplast suspensions always use CUT TIPS in order to minimize mechanical damage to the organelles.      9.    One “typical” error that occurs frequently is that no sorbitol is added in the Percoll solutions. This will result in osmotic burst of the chloroplasts.      10.    For easy storage and handling, chloroplast suspensions are pipetted drop by drop directly in liquid nitrogen and after-wards collected in Eppendorf tubes. In this way only part of a tube can be used, while the rest is kept frozen at −80 °C.      11.    Expected chloroplast yields at the volumes mentioned in these protocols are in the range of 1–2 mg chlorophyll for Arabidopsis and 7–10 mg for pea.      12.    The stromal content of Arabidopsis chloroplasts is frequently lost during the isolation procedure [ 19 ]. This becomes visible in a comparison of the total protein content of isolated chlo-
roplasts from different species by SDS-PAGE as, for example, shown in Fig.  2  for pea and Arabidopsis and could present a serious problem for proteomic approaches. Therefore, it is crucial to check the amount of stromal proteins by SDS-PAGE before further usage when using Arabidopsis leaves as source for chloroplast isolation.       13.    To spot at which step problems might occur in cases where the yield of intact chloroplasts is too low, just check a drop of the chloroplast suspension from the different steps by light micros-copy (intact chloroplast can easily be recognized by applica-tion of phase contrast).

In this chapter, we describe a highly simple RuBisCO depletion method using protamine sulfate (PS). Addition of 0.1  % PS is sufficient to precipitate the RuBisCO from the leaf extracts of diverse plants including monocots and dicots. Our results of  SDS-  PAGE, Western blotting, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that both large and small subunits of RuBisCO were precipitated in the pellet fractions, while LAPs were enriched in the supernatant fraction after PS precipitation.

As plants perceive signals from the environment through leaves, one of the major goals of the scientific community is to dissect the components of signaling cascades which are initiated in response to stresses or other environmental cues like photoperiodism, etc, by analyzing the leaf proteome. However, the major bottleneck for analysis of leaf proteome is presence of a high-  abundant protein (HAP)—RuBisCO, which mask the expression and identification of low-abundant proteins (LAP) and thus hinders their analysis [ 2]. Mass
spectrometry-based identification of the leaf proteins often results in the repeated identification of large and small subunits of RuBisCO, resulting in a noteworthy loss of time and money [ 3].RuBisCO is present in the order of 105–107 molecules per cell and therefore, mask the LAPs like phosphatase, kinase,  transcriptional
226factors and other regulatory proteins whose concentrations are less than 10–100 molecules per cell [ 4]. As LAPs are important compo -nent of signaling, it is very important to analyze these in order to understand the physiology of plant cells. Therefore, several meth -ods using calcium/phytate [ 5], polyethylene glycol [ 6, 7], DTT [8], RuBisCO IgY affinity [ 9, 10], etc., have been proposed to deplete RuBisCO for the enrichment of LAPs. However, most of these methods are laborious and time consuming. Furthermore, most of these methods are comprised of multiple washing steps which often results in protein loss. Recently, we reported a prot -amine sulfate-based preferential precipitation of RuBisCO from plant leaves which results in significant enrichment of LAPs [ 11]. This novel method is simple, rapid, cost-effective, and universal (i.e., can be used for both monocots and dicots).In this chapter, we describe PS protocol in details so that it can
be followed up by other researchers.2 Materials 1. Pre-chilled pestle and mortar:  Take a set of pestle and mortar and pre-chill it using liquid nitrogen. 2.

3 Methods 1. Take 1  g of fresh healthy green leaves, grown in growth  chamber, and grind it in the pre-chilled pestle and mortar using liquid nitrogen. 2. Transfer the fine powder to a 50  mL round bottom tube and add 10  mL of Mg-NP-40 buffer and vortex vigorously. 3. Sonicate the homogenate for 1–2  min to allow breaking of the cell walls and then centrifuge at 12,000  g for 10  min at 4  °C. Transfer the supernatant containing total soluble proteins into a new tube. 4. Take out 1  mL of the total protein extract and add chilled 12.5 % TCA-acetone to precipitate the proteins. Incubate at −20 °C for 1  h. 5. To the rest of the supernatant fraction, add PS solution to a final concentration of 0.1  % (add 1  mL of 1  % PS solution to 9 mL protein solution). Allow precipitation of RuBisCO by incubating it on ice for 30  min and then centrifuge at 12,000  × g for 5 min at 4 °C to separate supernatant and pellet.
6. Transfer the supernatant (PSS) into a fresh tube, add four volumes of chilled 12.5  % TCA-acetone and incubate at −20 °C for 1  h. 7.

229to completely dissolve the pellet ( see Note 6 ). Add four  volumes of chilled 12.5  % TCA-acetone and incubate at −20  °C for 1 h. 8. After incubation, centrifuge the total, PSS and PSP fractions at 12,000  g for 10  min at 4  °C. Discard the supernatant and wash the pellets of each fraction (total, PSS, and PSP) with 80  %  acetone thrice. Sonicate the pellet each time for complete  suspension of pellet. This will enhance the results of washing. 9. Store the final pellets in 1.2  mL of 80  % acetone at −20  °C until use (Fig.  1). 1. Take out 100  μL of each sample in fresh Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge at 12,000  × g for 5  min at 4  °C to precipitate the proteins. 2. Air dry the pellets for 5–10  min or vacuum dry for 2–3  min. 3. Dissolve the pellets either in any low ionic strength of buffer of choice (usually 50  mM Tris–HCl, pH  7.5, is sufficient) or directly in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. 4. Quantify the proteins in each fraction either using 2-DE quant
kit (GE Healthcare) or by any other commercial kits. If the proteins are dissolved in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, use 2-D Quant kit (GE Healthcare) for protein quantification following manufacturer’s protocol.3.2 Protein Quantification and SDS-PAGE AnalysisTake 1 gm fresh leavesGrind it in liquid nitrogenAdd 10 mL of Tris -Mg/NP-40 buffer and sonicateCentrifuge at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 °CTake out the supernatant in fresh falcon tube Take 1 mL of this supernatant as total proteins (T )Add 4 volumes of 12.5 % TCA-acetone and incubate at –20 °C for 1 hrAdd 1 mL 1% PS solution to 9 mL of supernatant and incubate on ice for 30 mi nTake out the supernatant in freshfalcon tube (PSS)  Dissolve pellet in 10 mL of Tris-Mg/NP-40 buffer and sonicate (PSP)Collect supernatant and wash with 80% acetone three timesStore pellet in 80% acetone until useCentrifuge at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 °CFlowchart of precipitation of RuBisCO using 0.1% PS

After completion of the gel, stain it with Instant Blue stain and analyze the results. RuBisCO preferentially precipitates in the pellet fraction, while LAPs enrich in the supernatant fraction after 0.1  % PS precipitation as can be seen in rice and Arabidopsis (see Fig. 2a). 1.

231 2. For Western blotting, resolve the proteins on 12  % SDS-PAGE and then transfer the proteins on a PVDF membrane at 120  V for 1:30  h at 4  °C (see Note 8 ). 3. Stain the blot using Ponceau-S stain to check transfer of proteins on the PVDF membrane ( see Note 9 ). 4. Block the membrane using blocking solution for 2  h at 37  °C (see Note 10 ). 5. Incubate the membrane with primary antibodies (rice APX1, APXb, Cu/Zn SOD, MnSOD, DHAR, and SalT) for 2  h with constant shaking. After three washings in TBST, add second -ary antibodies and incubate for 1–2  h (for details of Western blotting experiments, please refer ref. [ 13]). 6. Wash again with TBST and develop the blot using SuperSignal™ West Pico kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After developing the blot, wash it using double-distilled water and scan it. APX1, APXb, Cu/Zn SOD, MnSOD, DHAR, and SalT are enriched in the PSS fraction, while large subunit of
RuBisCO is precipitated in the PSP fraction ( see Fig. 2b). 7. For 2-DE, dissolve 500  μg protein of total, PSS, and PSP frac -tions in lysis buffer and load it on 24  cm IPG strips pH  4–7. After isoelectric focusing, equilibrate the IPG strips and then resolve the proteins on 12  % SDS-PAGE for second  dimensional separation [for details of Western blotting and 2-DE experi -ments, please refer [ 11, 13]]. After completion of the gels, stain the gel using colloidal-CBB stain overnight with constant shaking. Next day, destain the gels using 30  % methanol. 2-DE gels of rice and Arabidopsis fractions clearly showed enrich -ment of LAPs in PSS fractions and precipitation of RuBisCO in PSP fractions ( see Fig. 2c, d). Thus, based on these results, it can be concluded that this PS precipitation method is simple, rapid, cost-effective and can be applied for both monocots (rice) and dicots (Arabidopsis).4 Notes

Addition of NP-40  in the protein extraction buffer solubilizes the membranes which results in the extraction of membrane bound proteins also and thus increases the protein yield. In addition, NP-40 enhances the protein solubility. 2. Initially concentrated HCl can be used to bring the pH of Tris near 8. After that, diluted HCl should be used to bring the required pH.  While handling HCl, always wear gloves. 3. As phenol is highly volatile and caustic, perform all steps under Fume Hood only. Always wear gloves and mask while handling phenol.

Usually 1 h of blocking is sufficient to prevent the nonspecific binding of antibodies to the membrane.AcknowledgementThis work was supported by a grant from the Next-Generation BioGreen 21 Program (SSAC, grant#: PJ011070032015), Rural

In prin ciple there are two scenarios. Proteins are pre-fractionated in some way, e.g. by gel electrophoresis or are analyzed as complex mixture (shot gun). Shot gun proteomics became recently more popular, because of technological developments on the mass spectrometer side which allows now the identiﬁ  cation of several thousand proteins from complex biological matrix. However, in many cases it is still useful to separate proteins ﬁ  rst in a gel. But not only mass spectrometer technology made progress. This is also true for the
sample preparation. Recently, protocols and techniques were developed which make the analysis of starting material in the low microgram range possible and also simplify the whole procedure. Detailed protocols will be described allowing also inexperienced beginners to get good results.

proteins. During the recent years, the sensitivity of the instruments improved dramatically and this development is still ongoing. We are close being able to analyze whole proteomes of low microgram range in a single shot (shotgun analysis). The sample preparation becomes more and more important. It should be quick, relatively easy to perform, reproducible and no or minimal loss of sample. Also recently protein sample preparation for mass spectrometry has made very much progress toward handling of small samples and easiness. Multistep procedures are usually not suited for starting material in the low microgram range. The loss of material during sample preparation is substantial. Therefore, one-step procedures are preferred. Inexperienced scientiﬁ  c staff is facing the problem of old protocols in the literature, incomplete handling procedures or protocols are scattered throughout several publications making
236it not easy getting a working protocol. The lack of important information or little “tricks” is the most often reason for irrepro-ducible experiments. Due to limitation in words or pages of publi-cations mostly the experimental part is shortened in a way that it is impossible to reproduce the procedure without prior knowledge. Very often the protocols are written by people using the procedures on a daily basis and handling of samples and techniques used are so obvious for them that little but important information is simply forgotten. In this chapter, we will disclose all details and following the protocols will produce good results instantly. We are using these protocols ourself for daily work, but also in training courses for scientist and scientiﬁ  c staff.  Separation of proteins in gels is still widely used therefore we start with a manual high-throughput method for in-gel digestion [ 1 ,  2 ] which will work for 1D gel bands as well as for 2D gel spots

The OASIS platform allows the use of an eight- channel pipette to add solutions, and with the help of the positive
pressure-96 stand the solutions are then simultaneously removed. Thus, one can make a manual digest of 96 samples in the same time and of the same quality that one could typically digest only 12 samples manually using standard 0.5 mL tubes. The in-gel diges-tion protocol for protein spots contains six steps: excision of spots/bands, destaining, reducing, alkylation, digestion, and peptide extraction.       1.    Use spot cutter to excise the gel plugs from the 2D-gel directly into the OASIS ®  MTP well. Recommended cutting tip size is 1.5 mm in diameter. Alternatively cut a band by scalpel directly from the gel, place it at the upper rim of an OASIS ®  MTP well and cut it in 1 mm 3  pieces. Then push them down into the well by a pipette tip.      2.    Remove the liquid from the excision process into the waste plate (24 × 10 mL MTP plate) using the positive pressure-96 stand (PPS) (if not otherwise stated 15 PSI of nitrogen pres-sure was always used).
sure was always used).      3.    Add 70 μL acetonitrile (ACN) and push the gel pieces down into the solution if necessary.   2.7  STAGE Tip Peptide Cleaning and Desalting [ 9 ]2.8  Pre-fractionating with Styrene Divinyl Benzene (SDB-RPS) [ 8 ]3.1  In-Gel Digestion by OASIS ®  MTP3.1.1  Excision of Spots/Bands from GelsThomas Franz and Xinping Li
239   4.    Wait for 10 to 15 min until the gel plugs are fully dehydrated (they will become small and white) ( see   Note 3  ).      5.    Using the PPS, remove all liquid into waste plate.            1.    Rehydrate gel pieces in 100 μL of 100 mM ABC, pH 8.0.      2.    After 10 min add an equal volume acetonitrile and wait for 10–15 min until the gel pieces are destained ( see   Note 4  ).      3.    Remove all liquid using the PPS and add 100 μL acetonitrile for 10 min to dehydrate the gel pieces.      4.    Remove all liquid using the PPS.             1.    Rehydrate gel pieces with 50 μL potassium ferricyanide and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C.      2.    Then add 50 μL sodium thiosulfate and incubate for 20 min at 37 °C.      3.    After 15 min remove the liquid.      4.    Then add 50 μL water and after 10 min 50 μL acetonitrile.      5.    Remove all the liquid after 15 min.      6.    Add 70 μL ABC and wait for 10 min.
6.    Add 70 μL ABC and wait for 10 min.      7.    Remove all the liquid after 15 min.      8.    Add acetonitrile and wait for 10–15 min ( see   Note 3  ).      9.    Remove acetonitrile by PPS.            1.    Rehydrate gel pieces in 100 μL reduction solution and incu-bate for 1 h at room temperature to reduce the cysteine bridges in the protein ( see  N ote 5  ).      2.    Remove excess liquid using the PPS.      3.    Incubate the gel pieces with 100 μL ACN and wait for 10–15 min until the gel pieces have dehydrated ( see   Note 3  ).      4.    Remove all liquid with the PPS.            1.    Swell gel pieces with 100 μL alkylation solution and incubate for 20 min at room temperature in the dark.      2.    Remove alkylation solution with the PPS and wash gel pieces with 100 μL ABC for 15 min.      3.    Remove ABC with the PPS, add 100 μL ACN and wait 10 min for the gel pieces to dehydrate and shrink.

Remove all liquid with the PPS, then rehydrate the gel pieces in 33 μL digestion solution (contains trypsin) at room temperature.      2.    After 20 min remove remaining buffer with the PPS.   3.1.2  Coomassie Gel Destaining3.1.3  Silver Gel Destaining [ 10 ]3.1.4  Reduction3.1.5  Alkylation3.1.6  Application of TrypsinSample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry
240   3.    Add 50 μl of 50 mM ABC, but prepared without trypsin, to cover the gel pieces and keep them wet during enzymatic digestion.      4.    Leave samples covered at room temperature overnight or if available in an incubator at 37 °C.            1.    With the PPS remove the digest solution into the waste plate (peptides will bind to the HLB column).      2.    Wash the OASIS ®  HLB column with 70 μL 0.1 % FA.      3.    Exchange the waste plate for the collection plate (0.5 mL/well) ( see   Note 6  ).      4.    Add 50 μL of extraction solution to each well of the Oasis plate and wait 20 min, then remove the extraction solution into col-lection plate with the PPS.      5.    Add 50 μL of acetonitrile to each well and wait 10 min, then remove the extraction solution into collection plate with the PPS.      6.    Completely dry eluted peptides in the collection plate using a vacuum centrifuge at 45 °C for 60 min.
vacuum centrifuge at 45 °C for 60 min.      7.    Freeze the dried extracts (peptides) at −20 °C or −80 °C (for storage >1 month).      8.    Re-dissolve the peptides in 7 μL 0.1 % formic acid for ESI-MS ( see   Note 7  ).           The ﬁ  lter-aided sample preparation belongs to the newer methods and is useful for starting material quantities above 50 μg. Particular attention is drawn to possible ﬁ  lter leakage of the membrane and the total loss of sample during the procedure ( see   Note 8  ).    1.    1.5 mL Eppendorf tube containing 50 Drosophila melanogas-ter heads (about 150 μg protein).      2.    Heat 1 mL of lysis buffer to 95 °C (2 min) and then add 100 μL to the heads.      3.    With an electric mortar homogenize the sample for 2 min.      4.    Heat the sample for 3 min at 95 °C.      5.    For further homogenization a Diagenode Bioruptor ®  plus is used. Set 15 cycles each 30 s sonication, 30 s break, position: high performance.

Add 200 μL of buffer B to a Nanosep 30 k Omega Centrifugal Device followed by 50 μL (about 75 μg protein) of the super-natant of the homogenized sample.      8.    Centrifuge at 12,000 ×  g  for 15 min.   3.1.7  Extraction and Cleaning/Desalting of Peptides3.2  Filter-Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) [ 6 ,  7 ]Thomas Franz and Xinping Li
241   9.    Collect the ﬂ  ow through (in case ﬁ  lter was leaking) and add 250 μL of buffer B to the residue in the ﬁ  lter.      10.    Centrifuge at 12,000 ×  g  for 15 min.      11.    Add again 250 μL buffer B and centrifuge at 12,000 ×  g  for 15 min.      12.    Alkylation step: add 300 μL of buffer C, mix with pipette carefully and wait 20 min at room temperature in the dark ( see   Note 9  ).      13.    Centrifuge at 12,000 ×  g  for 15 min.      14.    Add 250 μL buffer B and centrifuge again (12,000 ×  g  for 15 min).      15.    Add 200 μL buffer D, centrifuge again and repeat this step once more.      16.    Then add 50 μL buffer D to the sample followed by 3 μg of Trypsin and mix carefully by pipetting up and down.      17.    Fill a plastic sample box partly (two rows) with water and the digest solution containing closed ﬁ  lter devices are placed in an empty space. With closed lid place it into an incubator at 37 °C overnight.
overnight.      18.    Following the digest add 200 μL buffer D and centrifuge at 10,000 ×  g  for 15 min.      19.    Place the ﬂ  ow through in a vacuum concentrator for 30 min at 45 °C. Around 100 μL should be left.      20.    Take 2 μL of the digested sample for a NanoDrop OD 260/280 measurement [ 11 ] with water as reference ( see   Note 10  ).         This procedure is particular useful for shot gun proteomics of sam-ples like a single ﬂ  y head (~3 μg protein) as described here.    1.    Load one single Drosophila melanogaster head to the bottom of a 0.5 mL centrifugation tube (Eppendorf tube).      2.    Add 5 μL of Guanidine buffer ( see   Note 2  ).      3.    Heat sample for 10 min at 95 °C.      4.    For the homogenization of the single head use a Bandelin Sonoplus Ultrasonic device with a 1.5 mm Tip. Apply a total of 1.0 kJ energy at 50 % amplitude, which takes about 1 min. At the same time the head is also mechanically crushed with the
tip of the US stick which acts like a pistil.      5.    The homogenate is centrifuged to the bottom of the tube with a minitable centrifuge at 1,500 ×  g  and heated again for 10 min at 95 °C.      6.    Again homogenize for 30 s at 50 % amplitude by the Bandelin Ultrasonic device.   3.3  One-Step In-Solution Protein Solubilization, Reduction, Alkylation and In-Solution Digest [ 8 ]Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry
242   7.    Centrifuge the homogenate to the bottom of the tube again at 1,500 ×  g .      8.    Now 50 μL of buffer A are added and mixed by pipette ( see   Note 11  ).      9.    Add 1 μL Trypsin (stock: 1 μg/μL) and incubate at 37 °C over night at 800 rpm in an Eppendorf Thermomixer.      10.    Next day centrifuge the tube at 15,000 ×  g  for 15 min at room temperature.      11.    Take 2 μL of the supernatant and measure the peptide concentra-tion by NanoDrop OD 260/280 as described in Subheading  3.2  and proceed with the STAGE    tip procedure in Subheading  3.6 .        For larger samples from 100 μg to several mg of protein the one- step procedure in Subheading  3.3  needs to be modiﬁ  ed.    1.    To ten whole Drosophila melanogaster bodies (about 300 μg) add 100 μL of Guanidine buffer.      2.    Mechanically homogenize it with an electric mortar in a 1.5 mL centrifugation tube.      3.    Boil the mixture for 5 min at 95 °C in an Eppendorf Thermo
mixer at 600 rpm.      4.    Homogenize further by sonication (ﬁ  ve cycles 30 s, 30 s, posi-tion high) in a Bioruptor TM  plus in ice cold water.      5.    The homogenate is centrifuged to the bottom of the tube with a mini table centrifuge at 1,500 ×  g .      6.    Boil again for 5 min at 95 °C in a Eppendorf Thermo mixer at 600 rpm.      7.    Homogenize again with ﬁ  ve cycles 30 s, 30 s, position high in a Bioruptor TM  plus in ice cold water.      8.    Dilute with 900 mL buffer A.      9.    Centrifuge for 10 min at 15,000 ×  g .      10.    Place 100 μL of supernatant on an Omega 30 kDa ﬁ  lter device.      11.    Add 5 μg Trypsin at a concentration of 1 μg/μL in 50 mM acetic acid and incubated overnight at 37 °C as described in Subheading  3.2 .      12.    Next day centrifuge the tube at 15,000 ×  g  for 15 min at room temperature.      13.    Take 2 μL of the ﬂ  ow through and measure the protein con-centration with NanoDrop OD 260/280 as described and
proceed with STAGE tip procedure Subheading  3.6 .            1.    Add 100 μL of Guanidine buffer to about 30 μL of “wet worm pellet” ( see   Note 12  ).      2.    Heat the sample in a Thermomixer at 95 °C for 10 min at 600 rpm.   3.4  One Step Guanidine Method for Large Scale Analysis3.5  Preparation of  C. elegans  SampleThomas Franz and Xinping Li
243   3.    Homogenize with Bioruptor plus at: 30 s sonication, 30 s off, ten cycles, position: high performance in an ice bath.      4.    Heat again in the Thermomixer at 95 °C for 10 min at 600 rpm.      5.    Homogenize again with Bioruptor plus: 30 s sonication, 30 s off, ten cycles, position: high performance.      6.    Centrifuge at 20,000 ×  g  for 10 min.      7.    Keep the supernatant.      8.    Take 4 μL of the protein solution, dilute 20 times with buffer A to reduce the concentration of Guanidine below 0.6 M.      9.    Check the concentration of the protein solution with NanoDrop.      10.    Digest the diluted protein solution at 37 °C overnight. Trypsin:protein = 1:50 ( see   Note 13  ).      11.    Centrifuge the digest at 15,000 ×  g  for 10 min and retain the supernatant.      12.    For STAGE tip cleaning,  see  Subheading  3.6 .             For the STAGE tip procedure a 2 mL centrifuge tube (Eppendorf
tube) with a custom-made adapter (Fig.  1 ) ( see   Note 14  ) to hold the tip or alternatively a TOMY “STAGE tip” centrifuge (Sonation) is used. STAGE tips can be produced with different capacities. With three layers of 3 M EmporeTM C18-SD solid phase extrac-tion disk and 1 mm inner diameter of the syringe for producing the tip one has about 10 μg binding capacity. For an inner diameter of 1.5 mm or 2.0 mm the binding capacities are about 30 μg or 50 μg, respectively. For larger quantities of protein up to 150 μg are commercial 4 mm (1 mL) Empore TM  C18-SD solid phase extrac-tion cartridges from 3 M available.

244Divinyl Benzene (SDB-RPS or SDB XC) Extraction disks with slightly different selectivities were found to be useful also for pre- fractionating samples [ 8 ].   The STAGE tip is produced by punching a plug out of a disk made of three layers of the EmporeTM C18-SD solid phase extraction disk with a syringe needle. By a wire with a little bit smaller diameter than the needles inner diameter the plug is removed from the backside and directly placed and tightly stuffed into the narrow end of a 200 μL pipette tip (Eppendorf). One can also make a spring-loaded syringe that helps preparing larger quantities of STAGE tips in short times (Fig.  2 ) [ 9 ].     1.    Wash the tips with 200 μL of solution A, centrifuge at 3,000 ×  g  for 2 min to remove the liquid.      2.    Wet the tips with 200 μL of solution B, centrifuge at 3,000 ×  g  for 2 min to remove the liquid.      3.    Equilibrate the tips with 200 μL of solution C, centrifuge at
3,000 ×  g  for 2 min to remove the liquid.      4.    First add 100–200 μL of solution C to the tip, then add 10 μg sample for a 1 mm Empore™ plug ( see   Note 15  ), centrifuge at 3,000 ×  g  for 2 min to remove the liquid.      5.    To wash salts out add 100 μL of solution C and centrifuge at 3,000 ×  g  for 2 min.      6.    Add 60 μL of solution B to elute the peptides. Plug a 10 mL syringe ( see   Note 16  ) with an adapter made from a BD Microlance TM  3 (Figure  3 ) into the wide end of the tip and push the liquid into a 0.5 mL Eppendorf tube ( see   Note 17  ).       7.    Concentrate the samples with a vacuum concentrator at 30 °C for about 25 min till dryness.      8.    Add 20 μL 0.1 % FA and take 2 μL to measure the concen-tration with the NanoDrop OD 260/280 against water as reference.

245    If a maximum of proteins should be identiﬁ  ed an easy to perform pre-fractionation can follow the STAGE tip cleaning. The SDB membrane containing tips are made in the same way as the STAGE tips with a 1.5 mm inner diameter syringe. Also three layers of the SDB membrane are used.    1.    The digest cleaned with STAGE Tip C18-SD ( see  Subheading  3.6 ) is re-suspended with 80 μl of buffer 1.      2.    Equilibrate the SDB tips with 200 μL of buffer 2.      3.    Load 80 μL of the digest to the SDB tips and remove the liq-uid by centrifugation at 3,000 ×  g  for 2 min or use the STAGE tip centrifuge as described above (Subheading  3.6 ).      4.    Add 200 μL buffer 2 for washing and centrifuge at 3,000 ×  g  for 2 min.      5.    Eluted the peptides with 80 μL of buffer 3, buffer 4 and buffer 5 sequentially, and collect eluates separately in 0.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.      6.    Dry the three fractions in a vacuum centrifuge at 45 °C for about 25 min.

Check the concentration with NanoDrop.       4    Notes      1.    0.1 % triﬂ  uoroacetic acid in the case of MALDI preparation.      2.    It is important to produce the Guanidine/TCEP/CAA/Tris buffer always fresh, because the components react with each other over time. First dissolve 5.73 g of GdmCl in 10 mL of Milli-Q water, then weight the other chemicals into a separate container and dissolve them with 3,000 μL of the GdmCl solution com-pletely and mix it with the rest of the GdmCl solution.      3.    It happens that acetonitrile runs through the HLB column without pressure. In this case just add acetonitrile again after 5 min.   3.7  Pre-fractionation of Protein Digests with Styrene Divinyl Benzene (SDB-RPS) [ 8 ]  Fig. 3    Syringe with orange adapter for the 200 μL tip for elution of peptides        Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry

The reaction can be shortened to 30 min by incubating at 37 °C.      6.    The PPS stand requires a certain height of the collection plate. We usually use a stack of three 0.5 mL/96-well collection plates, where the lower ones are just spacers.      7.    For MALDI-MS use 5 μL 0.1 % TFA.      8.    Some ﬁ  lters may even leak from beginning. To test that, add 200 μL buffer B to a couple of ﬁ  lters and centrifuge at 12,000 ×  g  for 5 min. Compare the amount of liquid left in the ﬁ  lter. Discard the ﬁ  lters with no or signiﬁ  cantly less liquid. It is not unusual that during the procedure the ﬁ  lter starts leaking too.      9.    DTT for reduction is in the lysis buffer.      10.    This is to calculate how much one needs to take for STAGE tip
peptide desalting and cleaning for MS analysis. Three layers of membrane have a capacity of 10 μg.      11.    Dilute at least 1:10, otherwise trypsin digest will not work.      12.    100 μL of “wet worm pellet” corresponds to ~1.8 mg peptides.      13.    For SILAC samples with only Lysine label use LysC.      14.    Also a hole in the lid of a 2 mL Eppendorf tube with the right diameter is ﬁ  ne.      15.    The amount is calculated from the NanoDrop OD 260/280 measurement.      16.    Before you connect the syringe pull the plunger out to the maximum volume.      17.    To squeeze the extraction solution out needs some force. Hold the tip and press it tightly against the syringe to avoid it falling off.            References     1.

Neubert        Abstract    Determination of a protein’s N-terminal sequence can be important for the characterization of protein processing. To increase the conﬁ  dence of protein N-terminal identiﬁ  cation, chemical derivatization of the N-terminal amine group by (N-Succinimidyloxycarbonylmethyl)tris(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)phospho-nium bromide (TMPP) or dimethyl labeling followed by mass spectrometric analysis is commonly per-formed. Using this approach, proteins can be separated by SDS-PAGE, and the protein N-terminus of
interest is labeled by TMPP or dimethyl in-gel before tryptic digestion and LC-MS analysis. The N-terminus of a protein can thus be easily identiﬁ  ed because the N-terminal tryptic peptides are preferentially labeled. Peptides with N-terminal derivatization produce a better fragmentation pattern during tandem mass spec-trometric analysis, which signiﬁ  cantly facilitates sequencing of these peptides.

In conventional shotgun proteomic analysis, it is difﬁ  cult to identify protein N-termini due to infrequent detection of protein N-terminal peptides. Several methods have been developed based on the N-terminal labeling to overcome this limitation, including TMPP and dimethyl labeling [ 2 ,  3 ].
TMPP and dimethyl labeling [ 2 ,  3 ].  The TMPP labeling approach is straightforward and has been successfully applied to different proteins [ 4 ]. Two characteristics of this labeling reagent promote the sensitivity of the method: (1) TMPP labeling introduces a permanent positive charge resulting in an enhanced ionization efﬁ  ciency and thus a better detection of low-abundance peptides; (2) the hydrophobic TMPP group shifts the retention time of TMPP-derivatized peptides in reversed-phase chromatography toward a less complex part of the chromatogram, increasing the sensitivity of detection, especially for short N-terminal
250peptides that otherwise would not be retained on the column [ 3 ,  5 ]. In addition, TMPP is fully compatible with all standard detergents, chaotropic agents, and reducing conditions used for protein extrac-tion in proteomics [ 5 ], which makes TMPP labeling a com monly used method for protein N-terminal sequencing.  An alternative method based on chemical labeling is dimethyl-ation, which labels peptide N-termini and  ε -amino groups of lysine with water-soluble formaldehyde via reductive methylation [ 6 – 8 ]. In MS/MS analysis, this labeling strategy provides a signal enhance-ment for the a 1  and y  n  − 1  ions, which are not detectable from most of the nonderivatized fragments [ 8 ]. Because of its simplicity, as well as low cost, dimethyl labeling is another promising strategy for protein N-termini identiﬁ  cation.  Due to the relatively simple experimental design (classical 1D SDS-PAGE, a single chemical derivatization step performed at the
protein level in-gel, followed by protein digestion and LC-MS/MS, as illustrated in Fig.  1 ), the two chemical derivation approaches can be readily used to analyze both puriﬁ  ed proteins and highly complex protein mixtures [ 5 ]. Here, N-terminal identiﬁ  cation using TMPP and dimethyl labeling of puriﬁ  ed protein hemoglobin and BSA is described.   2    Materials  Prepare all solutions using HPLC grade solvents unless indicated otherwise.

Data analysis software: Mascot Distiller 2.5.1.       3    Methods  Carry out all procedures at room temperature unless otherwise speciﬁ  ed.       1.    Dilute the protein samples (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 pmol) with water. Mix the diluted samples with the 2× Laemmli sample buffer (1:1). Heat protein samples at 95 °C for 5 min. Spin the tubes for a few seconds and load protein samples to the 4–15 % gel along with protein standard. Electrophorese    at 15 mA until the sample has entered the separation gel and then continue at 25 mA until the dye front has reached the bottom of the gel ( see   Note   7).      2.    Following electrophoresis, open the gel cassette with the lever and gently remove the gel from the cassette and transfer to a clean container. Rinse the gel with water for 10 min to remove any particulate matter, and repeat twice ( see   Note 8  ).
3.    Stain the gel with approximately 15–20 ml Coomassie Blue Staining solution ( see   Note 9  ).      4.    Replace the staining buffer with water and wash the gel on an orbital shaker for 30–60 min until the background color is weak.      5.    Use a clean scalpel to excise the gel band of interest, cut the gel band into small pieces and transfer the gel band into a clean 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube ( see   Notes 10   and  11 ).            1.    Add 200 μl 50 % ACN in TEAB buffer and agitate (600–   1,000 rpm) in an Eppendorf thermomixer for 20 min. Discard the liquid. Add 200 μl TEAB and agitate (600–1,000 rpm) for 20 min. Discard the liquid ( see   Note 12  ). Repeat until the gel band is completely destained.      2.    Add 50 μl 100 % ACN and agitate (600–1,000 rpm) for 10 min. Discard the liquid and dry the gel in a vacuum centri-fuge for 5 min.      3.    Add 50 μl freshly prepared 10 mM DTT solution to cover the
gel pieces and agitate (600–1,000 rpm) for 45 min at 56 °C. Cool to room temperature, and discard the liquid.      4.    Add 100 μl freshly prepared 55 mM iodoacetamide to the tube.

253   6.    Add 100 μl 50 % ACN in TEAB buffer and agitate (600–1,000 rpm) for 10 min to wash away the reagents. Discard the liquid. Add 100 μl 100 % ACN and agitate for 10 min. Spin brieﬂ y and discard the liquid. Repeat. Dry the gel piece in a vacuum centrifuge for 5 min.            1.    For TMPP labeling: add 10 μl TMPP solution in ACN to dry gel piece. Then add 40 μl 100 mM HEPES buffer and incu-bate overnight ( see   Note 14  ).  For dimethyl labeling: add 100 μl 100 mM sodium ace-tate, 1 μl 4 % formaldehyde and 1 μl 260 mM sodium cyano-borohydride to the dehydrated gel pieces. Incubate the gel pieces for 20 min while mixing using a bench top test tube mixer ( see   Note 15  ).      2.    Discard the liquid. Add 100 μl water and agitate for 10 min. Spin brieﬂ  y and discard the liquid. Add 100 μl ACN and agi-tate for 10 min. Spin brieﬂ  y and discard the liquid. Repeat washing alternately with water and ACN for 3–4 times until
excess labeling reagent is removed.      3.    Digestion. Add freshly prepared working solution of Promega trypsin (0.2–0.3 μg Trypsin in 20 μl TEAB buffer), incubate on ice for 30 min. Add 40 μl TEAB buffer and leave on agita-tor (300 rpm) overnight at 37 °C.      4.    Peptide extraction. Add 50 μl 5 % formic acid (FA), agitate for 15 min, collect the liquid; then add 50 μl acetonitrile, agitate for 15 min, collect the liquid to the same tube.      5.    Repeat  step 4  . Concentrate collected sample to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge. Dissolve peptides with 10 μl 0.1 % FA.      6.    Desalt peptides with a C18 ZipTip (following the protocol from Millipore), and concentrate sample to dryness in a speed vac. Dissolve peptides in 10 μl 0.1 % FA.      7.    Transfer solution to an injection vial for LC-MS/MS ( see   Note 16  ).            1.    A nanoHPLC system was used for separation of the protein digests. Buffer A and buffer B were used as mobile phases for
gradient separation. Protein digests were automatically loaded onto a C18 reversed-phase column (column temperature 50 °C). Due to the increased retention time of TMPP-labeled N-terminal peptides [ 5 ], elution was achieved with a gradient of 0–30 % B over 40 min, 30–90 % B over 40 min, and 90 % B for 10 min. For dimethyl labeling (no signiﬁ  cant retention time shift is caused by dimethyl labeling of peptides), elution was achieved with a gradient of 0–30 % B over 80 min, 30–90 % B over 1 min, and 90 % B for 9 min.   3.3  N-Terminal Labeling and Protein Digestion3.4  Mass Spectrometric AnalysisLabeling Methods for Identifying Protein N-termini
254   2.    The Q-Exactive mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode using a top ten method. Full MS scans were acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer over a range of 300–1,650  m / z  with resolution 70,000 ( m / z  200). The target value was 3.00E + 06. The ten most intense peaks with charge state ≥2 were fragmented in the HCD collision cell with nor-malized collision energy of 27 %, and tandem mass spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer with resolution 17,500 ( m / z  200). The target value was 1.00E + 06. The ion selection threshold was 1.70E + 04 counts, and the maximum allowed ion accumulation times were 20 ms for full MS scans and 60 ms for MS/MS [ 9 ].      3.    Peak lists were created and searched by Mascot Distiller. Software setting: semiTrypsin with one missed cleavage; carb-amidomethyl (C) as ﬁ  xed modiﬁ  cation; oxidation (M) as vari-able modiﬁ  cation. For TMPP labeling, a mass addition of
572.1811(C29H33O10P) (N-terminus, K and Y) must be included as a variable modiﬁ  cation. For dimethyl labeling, a mass addition of 28.0313 (C 2 H 4 ) (N-terminus, K, P and R) as a variable modiﬁ  cation must be included. Peptide tolerance was set to 10 ppm for peptides and MS/MS tolerance was 0.03 Da ( see   Note 17  ).      4.    MS/MS spectra of TMPP-labeled peptide VLSPADK (Hemoglobin A) and TMPP-labeled peptide DTHKSEIAHR (BSA) are shown in Fig.  2 . As illustrated in Fig.  3 , dimethyl-labeled peptide VLSPADK or DTHKSEIAHR identiﬁ  ed the same N-terminal sequences of Hemoglobin A and BSA respec-tively. We also found dimethyl labeling to be more sensitive than TMPP labeling (Detection limit: 0.1 pmol BSA for dimethyl; 3 pmol BSA for TMPP).         4    Notes      1.    Add 50 μl 2-mercaptoethanol to 950 μl Laemmli sample buf-fer. Protein sample is mixed 1:1 (v/v) with the sample buffer.      2.    Gel format: 8.6 × 6.7 cm (W × L), 10-well comb for 50 μl

257   7.    Pull the green tape gently to remove it from the bottom of the cassette and remove the comb by pulling upward in one smooth motion to keep the lane straight.      8.    Do not touch the gel with ungloved hands and always use a new or acid-cleaned dish to avoid contamination.      9.    Make sure the staining buffer covers the gel completely.      10.    Be sure to use extremely clean surfaces and new scalpels. This should be done in a ﬂ  ow hood to minimize the possibility of contamination by dust, hair, ﬂ  akes of skin, or other forms of dirt.      11.    Use polypropylene tubes and low-retention tips to minimize protein loss by adsorption to tube walls.      12.    An increase of temperature (e.g. to 50 °C) promotes the destaining process.      13.    Iodoacetamide is unstable and light-sensitive. Prepare iodo-acetamide solutions immediately before use and perform alkyl-ation in the dark. Excess reaction time will cause other
functional groups to be labeled.      14.    For TMPP labeling, do not use ammonium bicarbonate or Tris buffer that can decrease the labeling efﬁ  ciency.      15.    For dimethyl labeling, during sample preparation, no buffers and solutions containing primary amines (such as ammonium bicar-bonate and Tris) should be used that can decrease the labeling efﬁ ciency, as formaldehyde can react with these reagents [ 10 ].      16.    Before loading peptide samples for LC-MS/MS, avoid sample contamination by keratin, polymers, and detergents. Try to work as cleanly as possible, especially before tryptic digestion, because contamination with other proteins can prevent identiﬁ  cation of the protein of interest. The most frequent contaminants are BSA and human keratin. The keratin comes from dust, small hairs, and ﬁ  ngerprints. Even a small hair contains overwhelming amounts of keratin compared to the amount of your sample.
17.    Selective N-terminal TMPP derivatization can be achieved by keeping the solution at pH 8.2, exploiting the weaker basicity of the N-terminal amine relative to the  ε -amino group of the lysine side chain [ 5 ]. In order to minimize derivatization of tyrosine residues, 0.1 M hydroxylamine can be added to the solution to quench the derivatizing reagent 1 h after TMPP labeling reaction begins [ 5 ,  11 ].

Using HeLa cells, we describe a strategy for the optimization of protocols for whole proteome analysis. We cover cell lysis, protein precipitation and digestion, comparing the results obtained using different parameters and offering various possibilities for the optimization of a proteomic workflow which can be used for virtually any type of animal cell grown in culture.
of animal cell grown in culture.Key words Mass spectrometry, Cell lysis, Protein digestion, Proteomics, Method optimization1 IntroductionMass spectrometry-based proteomics has become the major tool for the identification, characterization, and quantification of pro -teins. The commonly used strategy, the so-called bottom up strategy [ 1], is based on the proteolytic cleavage of the proteins to be analyzed followed by analysis of the resulting peptides by mass spectrometry. The extraction of proteins from sample mate -rial and the proteolytic digestion are strongly influencing the number of proteins identified and hence the performance of the analysis [ 2, 3]. Dependent on the type of sample analyzed and the person performing the experiment, buffers, protocols and techniques vary strongly (e.g. [ 4–7]) making it difficult for the inexperienced operator to choose a particular method. It is often advisable, if a sufficient amount of material is available, to test
different conditions for sample preparation in order to determine the optimal parameters for each sample. To achieve optimal results, several steps of the protocol can be optimized. These include: harvesting and lysis of cells, extraction and subsequent proteolytic digestion of proteins and, if in-gel digestions are carried
260out, extraction of peptides from the gel pieces. To this end, we optimized a protocol for the processing of HeLa S3 cells, the arguably most commonly used cell line. We tested three different buffers in combination with two methods for mechanical disrup -tion for cell lysis and two methods for precipitation of proteins. Using the optimal parameters from these experiments, we opti -mized the extraction of peptides from the in-gel-digested samples in order to allow for an efficient recovery of peptides from the gel pieces. Finally, we generated whole proteome samples which were digested using nine different strategies: six employing in-solution digestion and three in-gel digestion protocols.2 MaterialsPrepare all solutions (except of PBS and trypsin/EDTA solution) using HPLC grade water. 1.

The keratin proteins may lead to abundant peptide signals occluding peptides of the sample proteins to be identified, while other contaminants with surfactant-like properties can sig -nificantly affect the ionization of the analytes of interest. Therefore
new plastic ware, pre-stacked pipet tips, LC-MS grade solvents and high purity chemicals should be used. A laboratory coat and fresh gloves should be worn and they should be kept clean. Frequent changes of gloves further reduce the risk of contamination. It should especially be avoided to bring any surface in contact with potentially contaminated surfaces, skin, clothing and/or hair that is, or will be, in direct contact with the sample. In order to mini -mize sample loss, maximum recovery/low binding 1.5  ml tubes are recommended for all steps. For the optimization of a proteomic workflow, several parts of the protocol can be altered. An overview for a possible strategy is depicted in Fig.  1.Cells should always be washed with PBS or similar solutions (e.g. Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, HBSS) before being harvested in order to remove proteins and other contaminants found in the culture medium. 1. Aspirate the cell culture medium and wash the cells with 10  ml PBS.
PBS. 2. Add trypsin/EDTA solution (1  ml for 10  cm plates, 2.5  ml for 15 cm plates) ( see Note 11 ) to the cells and incubate for 5  min. Subsequently add 10  ml of ice cold 1× PBS to the plate, detach cells by trituration and transfer the suspension into a 15  ml tube. Centrifuge at 4  °C for 5  min at 500  × g, aspirate the PBS 3.1 Cell HarvestingDominic Winter et al.
263without disturbing the pellet and wash cells once more with 10 ml ice cold PBS followed by centrifugation at 4  °C for 5 min at 500  × g. If the samples are not to be processed directly, flash-  freeze cells using liquid nitrogen or dry ice and store at −80  °C.The following steps should be carried out on ice. 1. Add the lysis buffer (RIPA buffer, GlyNP40 buffer or GCL buffer) to the cell pellet with a pellet volume to buffer volume ratio of 1:10 and transfer the sample to a 1.5  ml tube.(a) For syringe lysis, the cell suspension has to be passed five times through a 26.5  G (or higher) needle in order to dis -rupt cell walls and shear the DNA.  It is important that the needles chosen are long enough to reach the bottom of 3.2 Cell LysisHELA S3 CellsLysis Bu ﬀers: RIPA   GlyNP40 GClMechanical Cell disrup/g415on: Syringe SonicatorProtein Pr ecipita/g415on: C/M TCASamples pr epar ed with Op/g415mi zed Lysis and Extr ac/g415on Pr ocedur eIn Solu/g415onDiges/g415onab

264the 1.5  ml tube and that no air is entering the syringe while lyzing the cells, as otherwise foaming can occur resulting in reduced lysis efficiency and sample loss. A fresh syringe and needle should be used for each sample.(b) For cell lysis using a sonicator, the tip of the sonicator has to be submerged in the cell suspension and a sufficient amount of energy has to be introduced to lyze the cells and shear the DNA.  For small sample volumes of up to 500 μl usually a low amplitude is sufficient. If a microtip is used (tip diameter of 1  mm), it is possible to increase the amplitude up to 90  %, dependent on the sonicator. Formation of aerosol and/or foam should be avoided by adjusting the amplitude accordingly as otherwise sample loss can occur. Sonicate the samples for 30  s and put them on ice for a minimum of 30  s after each cycle to prevent overheating of the samples. Perform at least three cycles of sonication and incubation on ice ( see Note 12 ).
sonication and incubation on ice ( see Note 12 ). 2. Centrifuge the cell lysate at 4  °C for 30  min at 20,000  × g. Transfer the clear supernatant to a new 1.5  ml tube, avoid the pellet (cell debris) at the bottom of the tube and (if present) the fluffy white layer on top of the liquid (lipids). The cell lysate can be stored at −80  °C for months to years. 3. At this point a protein assay can be performed (e.g. Lowry, BCA or Bradford assay [ 8]) to determine the protein content of the lysate. Sample dilutions of 1:10 and 1:20 are usually suf -ficient to generate values which are in the linear range of the assay using a standard BSA dilution series (0.025–1  mg/ml) (see Note 13 ).Based on our experience, the efficiency of the cell lysis with sonication is greatly dependent on the tip diameter of the sonica -tor, the energy employed for lysis, the sample volume and the buf -fer composition. For the results presented in Fig.  2 a tip with a
diameter of 5  mm was used. Using RIPA or NP40 buffer resulted in foam/aerosol generation and concomitant sample loss. Only the GCL buffer, most likely because of its higher viscosity due to the high salt content, did not lead to sample loss. In contrast to the sonication-based lysis, the syringe-based lysis was more effective due to smaller losses.We also evaluated the use of a sonication tips with a smaller diameter (data not shown). Using such microtip resulted in even better lysis than the syringe-based lysis as judged by the size of the resulting pellet after centrifugation. When compared to the use of the 5  mm sonication tips, the losses were minimal when using the sonication microtip. Thus, we advise to use, if available, a microtip or otherwise the syringe-based cell lysis.Dominic Winter et al.
265It is usually beneficial to purify proteins from the cell lysate as the detergents and salts of the lysis buffer can interfere with the subse -quent proteomics workflow. If SDS-PAGE is to be performed, this step can also be omitted. 1. Protein Precipitation : Use the clear supernatant of the cell lysate for protein precipitation with one of the following methods:(a) TCA Precipitation  [9]: Add TCA solution to the sample to a final concentration of 12.5  % (v/v) and vortex for 10 s. Incubate the sample on ice for 30  min and centrifuge at 4 °C for 30  min at 20,000  × g. Remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet and discard the liquid. Add 1 ml ice cold acetone to wash the pellet. Centrifuge at 4 °C for 30  min at 20,000  × g and repeat the washing step. Air-dry the pellet at room temperature.(b) Chloroform /Methanol Precipitation  [10]: Add ice cold chloroform/methanol solution to the sample with a ratio
5:1 (five parts cold chloroform/methanol solution to one part sample). Vortex for 20  s and centrifuge at 4  °C for 30 min at 20,000  × g. After centrifugation, three phases are visible: the lower phase is the organic chloroform phase and the upper phase is the aqueous methanol phase. The proteins form a solid third phase at the interface of the two liquid phases. The liquid phases have to be removed for 3.3 Protein PrecipitationC/M TCA C/M TCA C/M TCA C/M TCA C/M TCA C/M TCARIPA RIPA GClG Cl GlyNP40G lyNP40Syringe, 26.5 G needle5 passagesSonicator, 40% amplitude 5 x 30sFig. 2  Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gels of HeLa S3 protein extracts obtained using combinations of different lysis buffers (RIPA buffer, GlyNP40 buffer, GCL buffer), lysis methods (syringe and sonicator), and precipitation methods (TCA and C/M).

266which a glass syringe works best. When removing the liquid phases, great care should be taken not to touch the pro -tein disk with the tip of the syringe since it tends to stick to the tip and may be lost. The lower (chloroform) phase should be removed first. Usually, it works best if the 1.5  ml tube is held at an angle of approximately 45°; and one fol -lows the wall of the 1.5  ml tube with the needle of the glass syringe, moving past the protein disk at the upper side of the tube, slightly bending the needle. While remov -ing the chloroform phase, the protein disk usually attaches to the wall of the 1.5  ml tube making it easy to remove most of the remaining liquid. Add 1  ml of ice cold metha -nol to wash the disk comprising the precipitated proteins. Centrifuge the samples at 4  °C for 30  min at 20,000  × g and remove the supernatant. Air-dry the pellet at room temperature ( see Note 14 ).TCA protein precipitation was compatible with all three buffers
tested. In contrast, C/M precipitation of samples containing GCL buffer was not possible, as addition of chloroform/methanol to the GCL buffer resulted in the precipitation of large amounts of guanidinium chloride. For protein extraction, the combination of the GlyNP40 or RIPA buffer with syringe lysis and C/M precipita -tion delivered the best results ( see Fig. 2). We decided to continue with the combination of GlyNP40 buffer with syringe lysis and C/M precipitation, as the SDS contained in the RIPA buffer may not have been completely removed during the precipitation step. For the evaluation of the efficacy of the cell lysis and/or protein precipitation, SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie or silver staining can be used (for instructions see Subheading  3.4, step 1 –4).  If samples are supposed to be used for whole proteome analysis, the protein pellet can also be used directly for in-solution digestion.For the subsequent mass spectrometric analysis of the generated
cell lysates, the proteins have to be proteolytically digested. There are two major approaches: in-solution digestion [ 4] and in-  gel digestion [ 11]. In case of in-gel digestion, generated peptides have to be extracted from the gel pieces for which several protocols exist. In order to identify the most efficient way of extracting peptides, we compared different protocols using cell lysates generated with the most efficient method for cell lysis and protein precipitation. 1. Prepare aliquots of 25–100  μg of protein for each sample. Add 4× LDS sample buffer to each sample to a final concentration of 1× and incubate them at 95  °C for 10  min in order to dena -ture proteins ( see Note 15 ). 2. Reduce disulfide bonds by adding reduction solution to a final concentration of 5  mM DTT and incubation at 56  °C for 45 min at 800  rpm in a Thermomixer ( see Note 15 ).3.4 In-Gel Digestion and Peptide ExtractionDominic Winter et al.
267 3. Alkylate thiol groups by adding alkylation solution 1 to a final con -centration of 1  % acrylamide and incubating for 30  min at room temperature. Perform SDS-PAGE electrophoresis ( see Notes 16  and 17). 4. Stain the gel using Coomassie blue staining solution. The staining and destaining steps should each be performed for at least 2  h, preferably overnight ( see Notes 18  and 19). 5. For optimization of peptide extraction, choose one region of the sample lane (e.g. the region between 50 and 80  kDa) and excise the same region from all lanes using a clean scalpel. Move the big gel piece to a clean surface (e.g. a single use plas -tic Petri dish), cut the gel bands into small pieces (~1  mm3 cubes) and put them in 1.5  ml tubes ( see Note 20 ). 6. Add 500  μl of gel destaining solution and incubate at 25  °C for 30 min at 800  rpm in a Thermomixer. If the gel pieces are not all detached from the bottom of the 1.5  ml tube increase the
rpm value or the volume of destaining solution. 7. Discard the liquid and repeat step 6  as long as it takes to remove the Coomassie from the gel pieces (usually 1–2 repeats are sufficient). 8. Discard the liquid, add 500  μl of 100  % ACN and incubate the samples at 25  °C for 15  min at 800  rpm in a Thermomixer. The gel pieces should shrink and turn white during this step. 9. Discard the liquid and vacuum centrifuge the gel pieces until they are completely dry. The lids of the 1.5  ml tubes have to be open during vacuum centrifugation. 10. Add 10  μl of a 1:1 mixture of trypsin solution and 0.1  M TEAB to each sample tube (0.5  μg trypsin per sample) and incubate until the gel pieces have taken up all the liquid. 11. Add 50  μl of 0.1  M TEAB and incubate for 30  min at 37  °C. If the samples are not completely covered by liquid, add as much 0.1 M TEAB as needed to cover the samples completely. 12. Incubate the samples overnight at 37  °C.
12. Incubate the samples overnight at 37  °C. 13. Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5  ml tube. Do not discard this solution as the liquid supernatant will contain most of the peptides to be analyzed. 14. Choose one combination of extraction buffers for each sample (see Table  1). Add 100  μl of solution A to the 1.5  ml tubes con -taining the gel pieces and incubate at 800  rpm, 25  °C for 15  min in a Thermomixer and transfer the supernatant to the 1.5  ml tubes from step 13 . Repeat this step using solutions B and C and combine all extracts for each individual sample. If 100  μl are not sufficient to cover all gel pieces during peptide extraction increase the volume accordingly until all gel pieces are covered. 15. Vacuum centrifuge the 1.5  ml tubes with the pooled superna -tants until dryness.Optimization of MS Sample Preparation
268 16. Resuspend the samples by adding 20  μl peptide resuspension solution. 17. Proceed to MS analysis ( see Note 21 ).In our hands, the best results for the extraction of peptides from gel pieces were obtained with combination 8 ( see Fig. 3a).Whole cell lysates can either be digested in-solution or in-gel. For performing in-gel digestion, the sample should be allowed to elec -trophorese ~1  cm into the gel in order to keep the gel volume in a range which allows handling in a single 1.5  ml tube. 1. Prepare protein pellets containing 100  μg of protein. 2. Resuspend each protein pellet in one of the following solu -tions: 30  μl of US, 30  μl of RS, 45  μl of RUS, 20  μl of PS, 35  μl of PUS or 60  μl of ATS. 3. Incubate the samples for 45  min at 37  °C at 800  rpm in a Thermomixer for solubilization of the pellet. 4. Add reduction solution (final concentration 5  mM DTT) for reducing disulfide bonds and incubate for 1  h at 56  °C.
5. Add alkylation solution 2 (final concentration 15  mM IAA) to each sample for alkylation of thiol groups. Incubate the sam -ples for 45  min at room temperature in dark. 6. Add 1  μg of trypsin to each sample (enzyme to protein ratio is 1:100) and adjust the sample volume to 100  μl using 100  mM TEAB ( see Note 22 ).3.5 Digestion of Whole Cell Lysates3.5.1  In-Solution DigestionTable 1 Combinations of solutions for extracting peptides from gel piecesSolution A Solution B Solution CCombination 1 OES1 AES 1 100 % ACNCombination 2 OES 2 AES 2 100 % ACNCombination 3 OES 3 AES 3 100 % ACNCombination 4 OES 4 AES 4 100 % ACNCombination 5 OES 5 AES 5 100 % ACNCombination 6 OES 6 AES 6 100 % ACNCombination 7 AES 2 OES 2 OES 7Combination 8 OES 4 AES 6 100 % ACNCombination 9 OES 1 AES 6 100 % ACNCombination 10 OES 2 AES 6 100 % ACNOES organic extraction solution, AES aqueous extraction solution, ACN  acetonitrileDominic Winter et al.
269 7. Incubate at 37  °C overnight without shaking. 8. RapiGest has to be removed from the respective samples. Therefore add 5  μl 100  % TFA (final concentration 5  %) to the sample containing RapiGest [ 12], incubate for 45  min at 37  °C at 800  rpm in a Thermomixer, centrifuge for 30  min at 20,000  × g and transfer the supernatants to new tubes ( see Note 23 ). 9. Proceed to MS analysis. 1. Prepare protein pellets of 100  μg of protein, add 1× LDS buf -fer to the samples and incubate 10  min at 95  °C. 2. Reduce disulfide bonds by adding DTT to a final concentra -tion of 5  mM and incubation for 1  h at 56  °C. 3.

270 5. Excise the entire gel area containing the proteins, cut the gel to pieces and prepare the gel pieces as described in Subheading  3.3. 6. Add 1  μg of trypsin in a sufficient amount of solution (either TS, RS or PGS) to cover all gel pieces. 7. Incubate the samples overnight at 37  °C without shaking. 8. Transfer the supernatants to new 1.5  ml tubes and perform peptide extraction following the optimized protocol obtained from the experiments in Subheading  3.3. 9. In order be able to compare the samples to the in-solution digestion protocols, adjust the sample volume to similar values as obtained in the in-solution digestion by use of a vacuum centrifuge. Reduce the ACN content below 5  % as this will otherwise interfere with the binding of the peptides to the reversed phase material. 10. For the sample containing RapiGest, reduce the sample vol -ume to approximately 100  μl (take care not to dry down the
sample completely) and add 5  μl of 100  % TFA (final concen -tration 5  %), incubate at 37  °C at 800  rpm for 45  min in a Thermomixer, centrifuge at 20,000  × g for 30  min and transfer the supernatant to a new tube. 11. Proceed to MS analysis ( see Note 21 ).In our hands, the highest number of peptide and protein iden -tifications were achieved by in-solution digestion in the presence of RapiGest ( see Fig. 3b).4 Notes 1. One tablet of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail is sufficient for 10 or 50 ml of buffer. A 100× stock can be prepared by adding 1 tablet to 100  μl or 500  μl HPLC-grade water, respectively, and kept at -20  °C for up to 1 year. 2. NP-40 and Triton X-100 are highly viscous detergents. In order to pipet correct volumes, they should be handled at room temperature or higher temperatures, pipet tips should be cut to generate a larger opening and pipetting should be done slowly. After adding the viscous detergents the solution should
not be vortexed to avoid formation of foam. 3. HEPES, TRIS/HCl, EGTA, KCl, MgCl 2, Guanidine-HCl, NaCl, and SDS can be prepared as stock solutions and kept at room temperature for several months. TEAB usually ships as 1 M stock solution and should be stored at 4  °C. 4. Highly concentrated acids (TCA, TFA, HFBA, AA, and FA) cause severe skin burns and eye damage. They should be handled in the fume hood, safety glasses and gloves should be worn at all time.Dominic Winter et al.
271 5. Chloroform and methanol are toxic and cause irritation to skin. The stock bottles should be opened and the solution pre -pared in the fume hood. The C/M solution can be stored at room temperature in appropriate gas tight glass bottles. 6. In order to prepare a 1  M stock solution of DTT, dissolve 0.155  g of DTT powder in HPLC-grade water and bring the volume to 1  ml. The solution can be stored at −20  °C for up to 1 year. 7. For preparing a 40  % acrylamide solution dissolve 0.4  g of acrylamide in HPLC-grade water and bring the volume to 1 ml. This solution can be stored at −20  °C for up to 1 year. Acrylamide is toxic as powder and in solution; the powder should be handled in a fume hood. 8. It is advisable to divide the solution in aliquots of 1  μg each (10 μl) in order to prevent multiple freeze/thaw cycles. The trypsin solution can be stored at −20  °C for up to 1 year. If no ice is available, it is advisable to resuspend the trypsin in 0.1  %
acetic or formic acid or in solutions provided by some manu -facturers for prevention of auto-proteolysis. 9. For making 1  ml of a 8  M urea solution use 479.8  mg of urea and add 635.3  μl of 0.1  M TEAB.  The urea solution should always be prepared fresh in order to minimize artificial carbamylation. 10. Dissolve 0.184  g of iodoacetamide powder in HPLC-grade water and bring the volume to 1  ml to prepare a 1  M iodoacet -amide stock solution. This solution can be kept at −20  °C for up to 1 year. Exposure of iodoacetamide to light should be limited as much as possible in order to minimize light-induced decomposition. 11. The use of trypsin for harvesting of cells leads to a loss of the extracellular domains of cell surface proteins. If these domains are to be covered in the analysis, cells can also be harvested using enzyme-free solutions (e.g. Cellstripper by Cellgro) or by placing the culture dish on ice and directly adding a small
volume of lysis buffer (1–3  ml) followed by scraping of the plate with a cell scraper. As it is not possible to wash the cells after scraping them, it is advisable to wash them at least two times with 10  ml of ice cold PBS on the plate before adding the lysis buffer. 12. For optimal results, the tip of the sonicator should be kept in the center of the 1.5  ml tube and 1–3  mm above the bottom. Clean the sonicator tip, e.g. by using 70  % ethanol and preci -sion wipes (Kimtech Science), before using it for the next sam -ple to minimize carry over. The tip of the sonicator should not be touched while the sonicator is running to avoid injuries.Optimization of MS Sample Preparation
272 13. The compatibility of the protein assay with the components of the lysis buffer has to be verified before performing the assay. 14. It is not absolutely necessary to remove all of the liquid at this step if doing so may result in contact of the syringe needle with the protein disk as this may result in its loss. If the protein disk is still sticking to the wall of the 1.5  ml tube after adding the methanol, vortex the sample vigorously until the disk detaches. 15. Reduction of proteins can also be done simultaneously with protein denaturation by adding DTT to the LDS sample buffer before incubating at 95  °C. The acrylamide can be added directly after the sample cooled down to room temperature. If it is not intended to perform any mass spectrometry experi -ments with the SDS-PAGE gel, the alkylation step can be omitted. It is also possible to reduce and alkylate the samples after running the gel as part of the digestion protocol.
16. Precast SDS-PAGE gels decrease the risk of contaminations but are not a necessity. If the SDS-PAGE gels are self-made, special care should be taken to work as clean as possible to avoid contaminations by keratins. 17. Gels or gel pieces can be stored at 4  °C in water for several weeks. If longer storage is planned, 0.02–0.05  % sodium azide should be added to prevent bacterial or fungal growth. 18. It is possible to use other staining methods as, e.g. silver stain -ing if these are compatible with the mass spectrometric analysis. 19. If multiple lanes are to be cut in the same way (e.g. five condi -tions) make the horizontal cuts for all lanes first, this makes it easier to make reproducible cuts between different samples. Then make vertical cuts and transfer gel slices to the lid of the plastic dish for cutting it to cubes. Do not macerate the gel as small gel pieces can easily be transferred into, e.g. the autosam -pler vial resulting in clogged transfer lines.
pler vial resulting in clogged transfer lines. 20. For removing buffers it is practical to be able to pipet a big volume while having a narrow pipet tip in order to prevent the loss of small gel pieces. This can be achieved by combining a small (10  μl) pipet tip with a big (1  ml) pipet tip. The same pipet tip can be used for removing the destaining solution from the gel pieces of different samples before adding the pro -tease. After proteolytic digestion, separate tips have to be used. 21. If salt-sensitive analysis approaches are planned (e.g. MALDI) samples have to be desalted by using e.g. STAGE tips [ 13]. 22. TEAB was used in these experiments as it is compatible with primary amine labeling protocols (as employed in TMT, iTRAQ or dimethylation [ 14]), however, several common buffers like Dominic Winter et al.
273(NH 4HCO 3, tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (TRIS) or 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)) will work as well as long as the pH is correct. Alternatively to DTT, e.g. tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) can be used for reduction of disulfide bonds and acrylamide or chloracet -amide can be used instead of iodoacetamide for alkylation of thiol groups. 23. When adding TFA to the RapiGest containing samples, it can happen that gas bubbles are forming. The RapiGest pellet which is present after centrifugation is very loose, great care should be taken while recovering the supernatant.Acknowledgements  This work was supported by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the 7th Framework Program of the European Union.References 1.

Since most PTMs alter the molecular mass of a protein, mass spectrometry (MS) is the ideal analytical tool for studying various PTMs. However, PTMs are generally present in substoichiometric levels and
therefore their unmodiﬁ  ed counterpart often suppresses their signal in MS. Consequently, PTM analysis by MS is a challenging task requiring highly specialized and sensitive enrichment methods. Currently, several methods have been implemented for PTM enrichment and each of them has its drawbacks and advantages as they differ in selectivity and speciﬁ  city toward speciﬁ  c protein modiﬁ  cations. Unfortunately, for most of the more than 300 known modiﬁ  cations we have none or poor tools for selective enrichment.  Here, we describe a comprehensive workﬂ  ow to simultaneously study phosphorylation, acetylation, and  N -linked sialylated glycosylation from the same biological sample. The protocol involves an initial titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) step to enrich for phosphopeptides and sialylated  N -linked glycopeptides followed by glycan release and post-fractionation using sequential elution from immobilized metal afﬁ  nity chroma-
tography (SIMAC) to separate mono-phosphorylated and deglycosylated peptides from multi- phosphorylated ones. The IMAC ﬂ  ow-through and acidic elution is subsequently subjected to a next round of TiO 2  enrichment for further separation of mono-phosphopeptides from deglycosylated peptides. In addition, the acetylated peptides present in the ﬁ  rst TiO 2  ﬂ ow-through are enriched by immunoprecipi-tation (IP). Finally, the samples are fractionated by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) to reduce sample complexity and increase the coverage during LC-MS/MS analysis. This allows the analy-sis of multiple types of modiﬁ  cations from the same highly complex biological sample without decreasing the quality of each individual PTM study.

2761      Introduction  Proteins are frequently modiﬁ  ed by post-translational modiﬁ  cations (PTMs) such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and glycosylation. PTMs regulate protein structure, function and lifetime, modulating their activity in dynamic cells. Aberrations of protein regulation by modiﬁ  cations lead to the development of various disorders and dis-eases. Despite the pivotal role of PTMs in a range of biological processes, PTM analysis by mass spectrometry (MS) is a challeng-ing task since modiﬁ  ed peptides are present in substoichiometric amount in comparison to their unmodiﬁ  ed counterpart in proteo-lytic digests from cells or tissues. However, recent advances in PTM enrichment methods combined with the new generation of MS instrumentation have tremendously contributed to large- scale studies of PTMs.  Nowadays, several techniques exist for phosphopeptide enrichment prior to MS analysis. The most extensively used meth-
ods involve metal ions for the binding of negatively charged phos-phopeptides, i.e. immobilized metal afﬁ  nity chromatography (IMAC) [ 1 ,  2 ], and metal oxide afﬁ  nity chromatography such as titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) [ 3 – 5 ]. However, studies comparing vari-ous phosphopeptide enrichment methods showed that each method allows the isolation of distinct subset of phosphopeptides whereas none of the methods are able to provide a whole phos-phoproteome, even though they partially overlap [ 6 ]. On the other hand, this is highly dependent on the individuals perform-ing the analysis and on the numerous protocols that exist for the phosphopeptide enrichment. The possibility to combine the strength of different enrichment methods by serial performance has substantially improved the phosphoproteomic ﬁ  eld. For instance, the combination of IMAC and TiO 2  chromatography, known as “Sequential elution from IMAC” (SIMAC), has been
employed to separate mono- phosphorylated peptides from multi-ply phosphorylated peptides in large-scale studies [ 7 ]. IMAC has a stronger selectivity for multi- phosphopeptides than for mono-phosphopeptides, leading to a better characterization of the ﬁ  rst ones. Following these enrichment methods, a new multi-dimen-sional large-scale phosphopeptide enrichment strategy, known as the TiSH protocol was proposed to study phosphorylation from low amount of starting material ( ≤300 μg). The TiSH strategy includes an initial TiO 2  enrichment followed by SIMAC and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) fraction-ation to decrease the complexity of mono- phosphopeptide frac-tion [ 8 ]. The TiSH approach lead to several advances: (1) the TiO 2 -based pre-enrichment step improves the enrichment speci-ﬁ city compared to a setup utilizing only SIMAC; (2) TiO 2  is more robust than IMAC being compatible with several chemical reagents
[ 9 ], and (3) HILIC fractionation of the  mono- phosphorylated Marcella Nunes Melo-Braga et al.
277peptides increase the phosphopeptide coverage from complex mixtures. This increases throughput and allows for performing large-scale phosphoproteomics from low amounts of cells or bio-logical tissues.  Despite the high selectivity of TiO 2  toward phosphopeptides, it was later shown that TiO 2  also has a high selectivity toward  N -linked sialylated glycopeptides presumably due to the high neg-ative charge of these molecules [ 10 ]. Although there are several methods to enrich glycopeptides such as lectins [ 11 ] and hydrazine afﬁ nity puriﬁ  cation [ 12 ], only TiO 2  has the capability to selectively isolate sialylated glycopeptides [ 13 ]. Due to these additional prop-erties, TiO 2  has been successfully applied to simultaneously enrich phosphopeptides and  N -linked sialylated-glycopeptides [ 14 – 16 ].  Conversely to protein phosphorylation and glycosylation there is only one enrichment strategy available for lysine acetyla-
tion, which is acetyl-lysine immunoprecipitation (IP) [ 17 ]. Acetyl-lysine IP has allowed the identiﬁ  cation of hundreds to thousands of lysine acetylation sites in different organisms such as bacteria [ 18 ], plant [ 19 ], parasite [ 20 ], and human [ 21 ]. In addition, the IP of lysine acetylation has been combined with strong cation exchange (SCX) to simultaneously study acetylation and phos-phorylation [ 22 ], as well as with TiO 2  to simultaneously study phosphorylation, sialylated  N -glycosylation and lysine acetylation in mouse brains [ 15 ,  23 ]. However, the relative low amount of lysine acetylation sites from biological material compared to phos-phorylation sites suggests that lysine-acetylation is a rather low abundant PTM compared to phosphorylation. This means that the enrichment of peptides carrying lysine acetylation is highly dependent on the amount of starting material.  The simultaneous study of different PTMs allows the discov-
ery of potential interplays between them, which are known to co- regulate a range of biological processes [ 24 ]. Therefore, a number of strategies for serial enrichments have been reported in order to study different PTMs from the same sample (e.g. [ 24 ]).  Here, a modiﬁ  ed protocol of the TiSH approach, to simulta-neously study phosphopeptides, sialylated glycopeptides, and lysine acetylated peptides, is presented. Using this strategy, a comprehen-sive overview of proteomes and their selected PTMomes can be achieved from relatively low amount of biological material.  2    Materials  All the solutions and buffers should be prepared with Milli-Q water (UHQ), analytical grade reagents, and highest purity chemicals. Organic solutions should be prepared fresh or stored for no more than 2 weeks before performing the protocol to avoid changes in buffers composition. Strategy for Simultaneously Enrichment of PTMs

Database: Swiss-Prot human v3.53 database.       3    Methods  The complete workﬂ  ow for the multiple PTM enrichment strategy described in this chapter is illustrated in Fig.  1 . The workﬂ  ow con-sists of an initial simultaneous enrichment of phosphopeptides and  N -linked sialylated glycopeptides using the ﬁ  rst TiO 2  step. The ﬂ ow-through (FT) from this step is used to enrich acetylated pep-tides by IP. The K-Ac antibodies capture acetylated peptides, whereas the non-modiﬁ  ed peptides are present in the IP-FT. After
enzymatically release of  N -linked glycan structures from the sialylated  N -linked glycopeptides in the TiO 2  eluate, the multi- phosphopeptides are separated from the mono-phosphopeptides and deglycosylated peptides by SIMAC. Three fractions are obtained from IMAC: (I) IMAC-FT, (II) an acidic elution fraction (pH ≤ 2.3), and (III) a basic elution fraction (pH ≥ 11.3). The FT and acidic elution that contains deglycosylated peptides and mono- phosphopeptides are combined and subjected to a second milder TiO 2  chromatographic step to separate both types of modiﬁ  ed peptides. Finally, in order to decrease the complexity of mono- phosphopeptides, deglycosylated peptides and non-modiﬁ  ed pep-tides, HILIC fractionation is performed prior LC-MS/MS analysis. Here, a total of 500 μg of whole HeLa cell lysate was used for a qualitative analysis to illustrate the average outcome of the proto-col; although, the protocol can be optimized to different amounts
(lower or higher) and applied also for quantitative studies.        1.    Grow HeLa cells in DMEM medium until 90 % conﬂ  uence (~1 × 10 7  cells as starting material).      2.    Remove DMEM medium and wash cell monolayer twice with 5 mL washing buffer 1 pre-warmed to 37 °C.      3.    Add 5 mL ice-cold wash buffer 2 and harvest cells by scraping them off the plate.   2.11  Data Analysis3.1  Model Sample PreparationMarcella Nunes Melo-Braga et al.
281   4.    Collect cells into 15 mL falcon tube and pellet them by 5 min centrifugation, 250 ×  g  at 4 °C.      5.    Remove supernatant and snap-froze the cell pellet in liquid nitrogen.      6.    Store the cell pellet at −80 °C until further sample preparation.        Fig. 1    Enrichment workﬂ  ow. An initial titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) step is performed to enrich phosphopeptides and sialylated  N -linked glycopeptides followed by glycan release. Then, SIMAC is performed to separate mono- phosphorylated and deglycosylated peptides from multi-phosphorylated peptides. The IMAC-FT together with the IMAC acidic elution is subjected to a second round of TiO 2  enrichment to separate mono-phosphopeptides from deglycosylated peptides. In addition, the ﬁ  rst TiO 2 -FT is used to enrich acetylated peptides by IP . Finally, the samples are fractionated by HILIC prior to LC-MS/MS analysis        Strategy for Simultaneously Enrichment of PTMs
282      1.    Add 50 μL lysis buffer to the HeLa pellet (lysis buffer volume depends on the pellet size; here we used 1 × 10 7  cells). Vortex well and incubate for 2 h at room temperature (RT) ( see   Notes 5   and  6 ).      2.    After incubation, dilute the sample ten times with 20 mM TEAB, pH 7.5 and sonicate on ice. In order to alkylate the sample, 20 mM iodoacetamide is added and the sample is incu-bated for 20 min in the dark at RT.      3.    Digest the sample using trypsin (enzyme to substrate ratio 1:50) overnight (12–16 h) at RT.      4.    After incubation, quench the reaction with formic acid to a ﬁ nal concentration of 5 % and leave for 5 min at RT. Then, centrifuge for 15 min at 14,000 ×  g  in order to pellet lipids.      5.    Transfer the supernatant to another low-binding Eppendorf tube.             1.    Add 0.1 % TFA to the tryptic peptide sample to achieve approximately 1 mL of ﬁ  nal volume and adjust the pH to below 2.0.
below 2.0.      2.    Activate the HLB cartridge with 1 mL of 100 % methanol fol-lowed by 1 mL of 100 % ACN.      3.    Equilibrate the cartridge twice with 2 mL of 0.1 % TFA.      4.    Load the sample onto the HLB cartridge slowly and collect the FT.      5.    Pass again the FT through the same HLB cartridge.      6.    Wash the cartridge twice with 2 mL of 0.1 % TFA.      7.    Elute the peptides in a new low-binding Eppendorf tube with 1 mL of 60 % ACN/0.1 % TFA and lyophilize the sample.      8.    Reconstitute the sample in 0.1 % formic acid.      9.    Take an aliquot for amino acid analysis (AAA) to determine peptide concentration ( see   Note 9  ).              1.    Transfer 3 mg of TiO 2  beads (for 500 μg of starting material) to a new low-binding Eppendorf tube ( see   Note 10  ).      2.    Dilute the peptide sample at least ten times in TiO 2  loading buffer (v/v) and add the TiO 2  beads ( see   Note 11  ). Alternatively,
adjust the sample volume to achieve the proper loading buffer concentration such as for 100 μL sample add 50 μL water, 50 μL of 100 % TFA, 800 μL of 100 % ACN and 76 mg of glycolic acid.      3.    Incubate the sample on the shaker for 10 min at RT. Then, centrifuge to pellet the beads using a table centrifuge for 15 s ( see   Note 12  ).   3.2  Lysis, Reduction, Alkylation, and Digestion of Model Sample3.3  Desalting/Concentration of the Peptide Mixture on HLB/RP Cartridge ( See   Notes 7  and  8 )3.4  TiO 2  Batch Mode Enrichment of Phosphopeptides and Sialylated  N -GlycopeptidesMarcella Nunes Melo-Braga et al.
283   4.    Transfer the supernatant to another low-binding Eppendorf tube containing half of the amount of the TiO 2  beads as used in the ﬁ  rst round. Repeat the incubation as described above to increase the yield of peptides modiﬁ  ed by phosphorylation and sialylated  N -glycosylation ( see   Note 13  ).      5.    Save the supernatant (TiO 2 –FT) for further enrichment of acetylated and non-modiﬁ  ed peptides ( see  Subheading  3.8 ).      6.    Pool the TiO 2  beads from the two incubations using 100 μL of TiO 2  loading buffer and transfer to a new low-binding Eppendorf tube ( see   Note 14  ).      7.    Vortex the sample for 10 s and then centrifuge to pellet the beads. The supernatant is removed and pooled together with the TiO 2 –FT.      8.    Add 70–100 μL of TiO 2  washing buffer 1, vortex for 15 s and centrifuge to pellet the beads. This step is performed to remove the contaminating hydrophobic non-modiﬁ  ed peptides.
Repeat this step using 50–100 μL of TiO 2  washing buffer 2 in order to remove the hydrophilic non-modiﬁ  ed peptides and the neutral glycopeptides ( see   Note 15  ).      9.    Dry the beads for 10 min in the vacuum centrifuge or on the table ( see   Note 16  ).      10.    Elute the phosphopeptides and sialylated  N -glycopeptides by adding 100–150 μL of TiO 2  elution buffer. Vortex and incu-bate the solution in the shaker for 10 min to allow an efﬁ  cient elution.      11.    Centrifuge the solution for 1 min and pass the supernatant over a ﬁ  lter (C 8  stage tip) into a new low-binding Eppendorf tube to avoid the presence of TiO 2  beads in the solution. Wash the TiO 2  beads with 30 μL of elution buffer for 5 min, pass over the C 8  ﬁ lter and pool with the other TiO 2  eluate. To recover any peptide that bound to the C 8  ﬁ lter, add 5 μL of 30 % ACN to the C 8  stage tip and pass this solution through and collect with the TiO 2  eluates.
and collect with the TiO 2  eluates.      12.    Lyophilize the eluted peptides. Any remnant of ammonia can interfere with the subsequent steps.      13.    Lyophilize also the TiO 2 –FT to perform the lysine acetylation enrichment ( see  Subheadings  3.8  and  3.9 ).            1.    Redissolve the lyophilized peptides from the TiO 2  enrichment in 40 μL of 20 mM TEAB, pH 7.5 and add 1 μL of PNGase F and 0.5 μL of Sialidase A.      2.    Incubate at 37 °C overnight.      3.    To quench the reaction, add 1 μL of 10 % TFA.      3.5  Deglycosylation of  N -Linked GlycopeptidesStrategy for Simultaneously Enrichment of PTMs
284       1.    Slowly, dilute the acidiﬁ  ed deglycosylated peptide solution with 200 μL of SIMAC loading buffer ( see   Note 17  ). Adjust the pH to 1.6–1.8 using 10 % TFA solution.      2.    As in the TiO 2  enrichment, the amount of IMAC beads per sample amount is a crucial factor to avoid non-speciﬁ  c binding. The optimal quantity is 60–80 μL beads per 300 μg of starting material [ 8 ].      3.    Transfer 130 μL of IMAC beads (for 500 μg of starting mate-rial) to a low-binding Eppendorf tube and wash twice with 200 μL of IMAC loading buffer by mixing and table centrifu-gation ( see   Note 18  ).      4.    Add the peptide solution to the IMAC beads and incubate for 30 min at RT under slow rotation shaking.      5.    Centrifuge the sample for 15 s at 14,000 ×  g  and transfer half of the supernatant to a new low-binding Eppendorf tube called SIMAC–FT.      6.    Squeeze the tip of a 200 μL GELoader tip to retain the IMAC beads.
beads.      7.    Transfer the remaining solution with IMAC beads to the con-stricted 200 μL GELoader tip. Use a syringe to press the liquid through into the SIMAC–FT tube and pack the IMAC micro-column.      8.    Wash the IMAC column with 50 μL of loading buffer and col-lect it in the SIMAC–FT tube.      9.    Elute the mono-phosphorylated peptides from the IMAC col-umn with 70 μL of SIMAC elution buffer 1. The eluate is col-lected together with the SIMAC–FT from the above  steps 5  ,  7 , and  8 . This step should be performed slowly (around 1 drop/s) to allow mono-phosphorylated peptides to fall off the IMAC beads whereas multiphosphorylated peptides still are retained on the IMAC resin.      10.    Elute the multi-phosphorylated peptides with 80 μL of SIMAC elution buffer 2 directly down into a pre-equilibrated p200 stage tip blocked with a C 8  ﬁ lter plug and packed with R3 mate-rial (1–2 cm of R3) ( see  Subheading  3.10 ). It is important to
acidify the eluate with 8 μL of 100 % formic acid and 2 μL of 10 % TFA prior to the contact with R3 material ( see   Note 19  ).      11.    Elute the multi-phosphorylated peptides after washing the col-umn ( see  Subheading  3.10 ) and lyophilize the sample.            1.    Dilute the SIMAC–FT at least ten times with second TiO 2  loading buffer or adjust the loading buffer concentration by adding 100 % ACN and 100 % TFA to achieve a ﬁ  nal concen-tration of 70 % ACN/2 % TFA. Add the loading buffer or the 100 % ACN slowly to avoid peptide precipitation.   3.6  Enrichment of Multi- phosphorylated Peptides by SIMAC3.7  Separation of Mono- Phosphopeptides from Deglycosylated Peptides by Second TiO 2  EnrichmentMarcella Nunes Melo-Braga et al.
285   2.    Add the same amount of TiO 2  used previously in Subheading  3.4  (the same TiO 2  beads can be used if they are washed extensively with pH 11.0). Vortex and incubate for 10 min on a shaker.      3.    Centrifuge to pellet the beads and transfer the supernatant to a new low-binding Eppendorf tube containing half of the amount of TiO 2  beads. Then, incubate for 10 min as described in Subheading  3.4 .      4.    Centrifuge to pellet the beads and save the supernatant that contains the deglycosylated peptides.      5.    Pool the TiO 2  pellets using 100 μL of second TiO 2  washing buffer, vortex and centrifuge. Remove the supernatant and combine it with the deglycosylated peptides.      6.    Dry the beads for 10 min in the vacuum centrifuge or on the table ( see   Note 16  ).      7.    Add 100 μL of TiO 2  elution buffer, vortex and incubate for 10 min on a shaker to elute the mono-phosphopeptides.
8.    Centrifuge the solution for 1 min and pass the supernatant over a C 8  stage ﬁ  lter repeating the  item 10   from Subheading  3.6  but using two R3 micro-columns of 1.5 cm each (the number of R3 micro-columns depends on the amount of starting mate-rial) ( see   Note 20  ). This step is performed sequentially being the solution passed through the ﬁ  rst R3 and collected directly on top of the second R3 micro-column. Wash and elute the mono- phosphopeptides from both columns as described in Subheading  3.10 . Pool the eluates in the same tube. Lyophilize the mono-phosphopeptides.      9.    Lyophilize the second TiO 2 –FT that contains the deglycosyl-ated peptides. Subsequently, reconstitute the sample in 80 μL of 0.1 % TFA prior to R3 micro-puriﬁ  cation as described in Subheading  3.10 .              1.    The FT from the ﬁ  rst TiO 2  is used to enrich acetylated  peptides by immunoprecipitation.      2.    Dissolve the sample in 1 mL of 0.1 % TFA.
3.    Purify the sample by a HLB RP cartridge as described in Subheading  3.3  in order to remove glycolic acid present in the TiO 2  loading buffer.             1.    Reconstitute the above dried peptide sample in 200 μL of IP loading buffer and adjust the pH to 8.0 with sodium hydrox-ide or hydrochloric acid, respectively.      2.    For 100–200 μg of sample use 20 μL of slurry of anti-Lys acetylated antibody immobilized on agarose beads.      3.    Transfer 67 μL of anti-K-Ac antibody beads (for 500 μg of starting material) to a new low-binding Eppendorf tube and 3.8  Desalting/Concentration of the TiO 2 –FT on RP Columns Prior to Acetyl- Lysine IP3.9  Acetyl-Lysine IPStrategy for Simultaneously Enrichment of PTMs
286wash twice with 200 μL of IP loading buffer by mixing and table centrifugation ( see   Note 21  ).      4.    Incubate the reconstituted sample with the antibody for 12 h under rotation at 4 °C.      5.    Pellet the antibody beads using a table centrifuge and transfer the supernatant to a new low-binding Eppendorf tube. The supernatant (K-Ac–FT) contains the “non-modiﬁ  ed” peptides.      6.    Wash the anti-K-Ac-antibody beads four times with 200 μL of IP loading buffer as mentioned above. Pool all the superna-tants together into the K-Ac–FT tube.      7.    Wash twice the antibody beads with 200 μL of water as described above.      8.    Elute the K-Ac peptides with 200 μL of elution buffer and subsequently purify the eluate as described in Subheading  3.10 . Lyophilize the puriﬁ  ed K-Ac peptides.      9.    Lyophilize the K-Ac–FT that contains the non-modiﬁ  ed  peptides to be used for subsequent proteome analysis.
1.    Prepare a micro-column using p200 tip by plugging the con-stricted end with C 8  material ﬁ  lter. Pack 2 cm column with R3 material slurry in 100 % ACN by applying air pressure using a syringe.      2.    Equilibrate the column with 50–100 μL of 0.1 % TFA.      3.    Load the acidiﬁ  ed sample (pH < 2.0) into the column and make a gently air pressure. It is important to perform this step slowly. In case the sample is dried, add 80 μL of 0.1 % TFA to reconstitute the sample prior to load. Collect the FT.      4.    Pass again the FT through the micro-column to increase the binding of peptides.      5.    Wash the column with 100 μL of 0.1 % TFA.      6.    Elute the peptides into a new low-binding Eppendorf tube with 100 μL of 60 % ACN/0.1 % TFA.      7.    Lyophilize the sample in a vacuum centrifuge.            1.    Reconstitute the sample in 45 μL of HILIC solvent B by add-ing ﬁ rst 0.45 μL of 10 % TFA and then 4.05 μL of milli-Q
water. Vortex and ﬁ  nally add 40.5 μL of 100 % ACN slowly to avoid precipitation. This step should be performed immedi-ately prior to fractionation since the acetonitrile evaporates fast altering the efﬁ  ciency of the method.      2.    Inject 40 μL onto the microHPLC HILIC column.      3.    Fractionate the peptide mixture using the gradient described in Table  1 .       4.

287       5.    Pool the fractions according to the UV absorbance intensity ( λ  = 210 nm) and chromatographic proﬁ  le (Fig.  2 ). The num-ber of analyzed fractions depends on the complexity of the sample and the accessibility to LC-MS/MS instruments.       6.    Lyophilize the fractions.            1.    Reconstitute the dried samples (multi-phosphopeptides, acety-lated peptides as well as the HILIC fractions from mono- phosphopeptides, deglycosylated peptides and non-modiﬁ  ed peptides) in 0.1 % formic acid.      2.

Depending on the sample, the gradient was 0–34 % solvent B in 60, 90 or 120 min, 34–100 % solvent B in 5 min, and 8 min at 100 % solvent B.      5.    MS analysis was performed in an LTQ Orbitrap Velos system (Thermo Scientiﬁ  c, Bremen, Germany) with data-dependent acquisition for CID MS/MS analysis of the ten most intense ions except for phosphopeptides where MSA MS/MS analysis was used.        Data processing and search were performed using Proteome Discoverer v1.4 (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁ  c). Data were searched against the Swiss-Prot human v3.53 database using an in-house MASCOT server (v2.3, Matrix Science Ltd, London, UK) and the
Sequest HT. Trypsin was selected as digestion enzyme and two missed cleavages were allowed. Database searches were performed with the following parameters: precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm, product ion mass tolerance of 0.8 Da, and cysteine carbamido-methylation as ﬁ  xed modiﬁ  cation. Searches were also conducted with the following variable modiﬁ  cations: methionine oxidation; 3.13  Data Analysis  Fig. 2    HILIC chromatogram.

289serine, threonine, tyrosine phosphorylation; asparagine and gluta-mine deamidation. Protein grouping was performed, in order to avoid presence of different proteins identiﬁ  ed by non-unique pep-tides. Only peptides with up to  q -value of 0.01 (Percolator), Mascot and Sequest HT rank 1, Mascot and Sequest HT search engine 1, a Sequest HT Δ C  n  of 0.1, a cut-off value of Mascot score ≥22 and a cut-off value of XCorr score greater than 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 for charge states of +1, +2, +3, and +4, respectively, were consid-ered for further analysis.    Figure  3  highlights the number of modiﬁ  ed peptides identiﬁ  ed speciﬁ  cally by the analysis of the dedicated enrichment step described in this chapter. The four different steps achieved various speciﬁ  city and sensitivity regarding enrichment of modiﬁ  ed pep-tides. Mono- and multi-phosphorylated peptides were efﬁ  ciently enriched from the elution of the IMAC and second TiO 2  chroma-
tography achieving the identiﬁ  cation of thousands of phosphopep-tides. Hundreds of sialylated  N -glycopeptides were enriched from the FT of the second TiO 2  chromatography. Finally, acetylated peptides were enriched from the elution of the K-Ac IP. The rela-tive low number of identiﬁ  ed acetylated lysines is due to the lower abundance of this PTM in comparison with phosphorylation or  N -linked sialylated glycosylation in biological material. Furthermore, a high number of peptides contain more than one differently modiﬁ  ed site. Therefore, a signiﬁ  cant part of acetylated sites might co-purify with phosphopeptides during the ﬁ  rst TiO 2  enrichment step, causing the reduced number of acetylated pep-tides identiﬁ  ed in K-Ac IP.    3.14  Results  Fig. 3    Results obtained from the analysis of phosphopeptides, sialylated  N -linked glycopeptides and acetylated peptides using the optimized workﬂ  ow.

2904    Notes      1.    Protease inhibitor cocktail can be added if needed.      2.    The trypsin is puriﬁ  ed by benzamidine sepharose afﬁ  nity to guarantee the same proteolytic activity for the entire batch, as well as to signiﬁ  cantly reduce the level of autodigestion products.      3.    The choice between POROS Oligo R3 or Oasis HLB cartridge depends on the quantity of material. For peptide samples with quantity higher or equal to 500 μg, the Oasis HLB cartridge is often a choice.      4.    To avoid peptide precipitation add to the lyophilized sample 0.45 μL of 10 % TFA and then 4.05 μL of milli-Q water. Vortex and ﬁ nally add 40.5 μL of 100 % ACN. The ﬁ  nal concentration of dissolution buffer should be 90 % ACN/0.1 % TFA.      5.    Any protein extraction, denaturation, and digestion method is compatible with the present simultaneous PTMs enrichment strategy.      6.    Mix by vortexing and pipette cell pellet up and down after add-
ing lysis buffer. Cell lysate will form a very viscous solution due to the presence of nuclear DNA.      7.    POROS Oligo R3 micro-columns or Oasis HLB cartridges desalting step is required if the buffer solutions are not com-patible with labeling methods such as iTRAQ, TMT, dimethyl labeling; or prior to determination of protein concentration by AAA analysis.      8.    TiO 2  enrichment might be performed directly after the protein digestion step since TiO 2  chromatography is compatible with most of the commonly used buffer solutions [ 9 ].      9.    A labeling strategy such as iTRAQ, TMT or dimethyl labeling can be introduced in this step for quantitative studies. Remember to check the compatibility of buffer solutions with the speciﬁ  c labeling reagents.      10.    To reduce nonspeciﬁ  c binding to the TiO 2  resin, it is  important to adjust the amount of TiO 2  beads to the amount of sample. The optimal quantity is 0.6 mg TiO 2  beads per 100 μg peptide
solution [ 8 ].      11.    In case the sample was lyophilized before, it is crucial to recon-stitute the sample in a small volume of 0.1 % TFA. Moreover, the TiO 2  loading buffer should be added slowly to avoid pep-tide precipitation.      12.    Centrifugation time is not critic.      13.    This step can be done up to three times, depending on the sample complexity.   Marcella Nunes Melo-Braga et al.
291   14.    This step is performed to avoid contamination with non- modiﬁ  ed peptides that may bind to the Eppendorf tube surface.      15.    The washing buffer 2 is used to remove the peptides that bind in the HILIC mode to TiO 2 . The FT of washing buffer 2 con-tains neutral glycopeptides which can be analyzed as a separate PTM fraction.      16.    It is very important to dry the TiO 2  beads in the vacuum cen-trifuge. In case vacuum centrifuge is not available, it is neces-sary to check and adjust the pH to ≥11.3 in the next step.      17.    Prior adding 200 μL of SIMAC loading buffer, the sample can be lyophilized and then reconstituted in a small volume of 0.1 % TFA.      18.    Avoid vortexing the IMAC beads in high speed.      19.    The direct puriﬁ  cation is performed to avoid loss of multi- phosphopeptides that can bind to the tube surface. However, multi-phosphopeptides can be transferred to another low-
binding Eppendorf tube, following with adjustment of the pH eluate below 2.0 prior to desalting on RP column.      20.    This step uses two POROS Oligo R3 micro-columns to ensure a good recovery of phosphopeptides.      21.    The anti-K-Ac antibody beads stock solution and all solutions containing K-Ac antibody beads should be kept on ice constantly.      22.    Different LC-MS/MS set-up can be used. However, the results will differ from those obtained using the present protocol.            References     1.

Phosphorylation is a post-translational modiﬁ  cation with regulatory functions in a plethora of cell processes. We present an experimental workﬂ  ow for simultaneous analysis of the proteome and phosphoproteome with no
additional enrichment for phosphoproteins/phosphopeptides. Our approach is based on isoelectric focusing (IEF) which allows the separation of peptide mixtures on an immobilized pH gradient (IPG) according to their isoelectric point. Due to the negative charge of the phosphogroup, most of the phosphopeptides migrate toward acidic pH values. Peptides and phosphopeptides are then identiﬁ  ed by mass spectrometry (MS) and phosphopeptide spectra are manually checked for the assignment of phosphorylation sites.

2941        Introduction  Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteome proﬁ  ling provides a protein map for the biological material under investigation, facili-tating functional and quantitative analyses. Phosphorylation is a post- translational modiﬁ  cation that occurs in approximately one-third of all proteins and is involved in many biological processes in health and disease [ 1 ].  For proteome and phosphoproteome analysis, effective frac-tionation methods prior to MS are crucial to ensure high proteome coverage through peptide and phosphopeptide identiﬁ  cation. Here, we describe how isoelectric focusing (IEF), which has been traditionally used to separate proteins in the ﬁ  rst dimension of 2D-gel electrophoresis, can be used as an effective fractionation method both for peptides and phosphopeptides. Peptide mixtures are loaded onto an immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strip and upon application of electric current, peptides are separated according to
their isoelectric point (pI). The unique characteristic of IEF com-pared to other fractionation methods is the ability to simultaneously analyze peptides and phosphopeptides. This is due to the addition of a negatively charged phosphogroup to a peptide sequence which results in a decrease of its pI. As a consequence, phosphopeptides migrate toward the acidic part of the IPG strip [ 2 ].  MS analysis of the whole and the acidic part of the IPG strip allows the investigation of the proteome and the phosphopro-teome, respectively, with no additional step for phosphopeptide enrichment. The pI focusing position of each peptide on the IPG strip after IEF can be used to conﬁ  rm subsequent MS-based pep-tide identiﬁ  cations and/or validate the presence of post- translational modiﬁ  cations [ 3 – 5 ]. When applied to brain tissue, IEF has been shown to result in increased proteome coverage compared to 1D-SDS gel electrophoresis [ 6 ]. In this chapter, we provide a
detailed guide to proteome and phosphoproteome analysis by IEF. As study material we use synaptosomes, which are artiﬁ  cially isolated synapses [ 7 ], extracted from whole mouse brain. We chose brain synaptosomes for two reasons; (i) their proteome is highly complex (ii) phosphorylation plays a critical role in the regulation of synaptic function and neurotransmission [ 8 ]. In this protocol, we describe the following steps: (1) synaptosome enrichment from brain tissue and synaptosome enrichment quality control by Western blot, (2) sample preparation for IEF and IEF, (3) MS, (4) MS raw data analysis for peptide and phosphopeptide identiﬁ  cation and assignment of phosphorylation sites. The experimental work-ﬂ ow is shown in Fig.  1 . Mouse synaptosome analysis by IEF resulted in the identiﬁ  cation of up to 3,000 proteins and 118 phos-phoproteins [ 6 ].

For optimal results, perfused, snap frozen mouse
brain tissue is recommended ( see   Note 2  ).    1.    Tissue (mg) is homogenized in 10 volumes ( μl) of Buffer A by 12–15 up and down strokes. Phosphatase inhibitors II and III are added to Buffer A at a 1:100 v/v ratio each.      2.    Homogenates are centrifuged at 1,000 ×  g  for 10 min, 4 °C (S1: supernatant 1; P1: pellet 1 containing nuclei and cell debris).      3.    S1 is transferred to a different tube and P1 is resuspended in 10 volumes ( μl) of Buffer A (phosphatase inhibitors optional) and centrifuged at 1,000 ×  g  for 10 min, 4 °C (S2: supernatant 2; P2: pellet 2). S1 and S2 fractions are combined into fraction S.      4.

298   7.    Synaptosomal fraction is extracted from the 0.8 M/1.2 M sucrose interphase ( see   Note 3  ), diluted at a 1:1 v/v ratio in distilled water and ultracentrifuged at 164,000 ×  g  for 60 min, 4 °C (S4, P4).      8.    P4 is dissolved in 20 μl distilled water and stored at −20 °C ( see   Note 4  ).            1.    Protein content is estimated by Bradford protein assay.      2.    An aliquot of each synaptosomal fraction is loaded onto a 12.5 % SDS polyacrylamide gel.      3.    Electrotransfer of protein extracts onto an Immobilon PVDF membrane is performed for 1 h at 100 V. Membranes are blocked overnight with blocking buffer, followed by incuba-tion with the selected primary antibody for 1.5–2 h at room temperature, washing twice with TBS-T and 1 h incubation at room temperature with the corresponding secondary antibody ( see   Note 5  ).      4.    Immune complexes are detected by ECL Plus reagent kit.
1.    Synaptosomal proteins in distilled water are dissolved to a ﬁ  nal concentration of 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 8 M urea, pH 8.5 (ﬁ  nal volume of 100 μl) ( see   Note 6  ).      2.    Sample is reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol for 1 h at 37 °C and then alkylated in the dark by 50 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature.      3.    Urea concentration is reduced to 2 M by using a Vivaspin 5 kDa cartridge according to the manufacturer’s instruc-tions. The sample is washed three times with 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, and concentrated to a final sample volume of 100 μl. The sample is diluted by the addition of 100 μl distilled water in a total volume of 200 μl ( see   Note 7  ).      4.    The sample is digested with 24 μg endoproteinase Lys-C over-night at room temperature followed by overnight digestion with 24 μg trypsin at 37 °C ( see   Note 8  ).      5.    Distilled water and urea are added to a ﬁ  nal volume of 300 μl
and a concentration of 2.5 M, respectively.      6.    The sample is loaded on the IPG strip, left to be absorbed for 1 h at room temperature and then covered with mineral oil.      7.    The rehydration runs for 12 h at constant voltage (50 V).      8.    After rehydration is completed, electrode wicks wet with deionized water are placed at the basic and acidic ends of the IPG strip.      9.    IEF is performed following the voltage/current steps accord-ing to the manufacturer’s instructions for the IPG strip used ( see   Note 9  ).   3.1.2  Western Blot3.2  IEFGiuseppina Maccarrone and Michaela D. Filiou
299   10.    After IEF completion, the IPG strip is removed from the tray and mineral oil is drained by vertically holding the IPG strip.      11.    The IPG strip is cut in 4 mm pieces. Each gel piece is trans-ferred in a sample tube preﬁ  lled with 100 μl 5 % formic acid.      12.    Peptides from each gel piece are extracted with 50 μl 5 % for-mic acid three times (15 min vortexing and 15 min sonication) and the three supernatants are combined. To remove the resid-ual mineral oil from the combined supernatant, the peptide extracts are overlaid with hexane, mixed brieﬂ  y and the upper part of the organic solvent is discarded. The aqueous phase is kept and the oil extraction with hexane (50 μl) is repeated three times. After oil extraction, the aqueous phase is kept and lyophilized ( see   Note 10  ).      13.    The resulting pellet is oil extracted with 10 μl hexane and left to dry overnight. The following day, pellets are dissolved in
25 μl 5 % formic acid, desalted with OMIX tips according to the manufacturer’s instructions and lyophilized ( see   Note 11  ).            1.    Lyophilized peptides from each IPG strip fraction are dissolved in 6 μl 1 % formic acid.      2.    LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis is performed with a nanoﬂ  ow HPLC- 2D system coupled online to an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer via a nano ESI. The mass spectrometer is oper-ated in the positive ion mode data-dependent scan acquisition using Xcalibur. Full scans are recorded in the Orbitrap mass analyzer (resolution- FWHM 60000) at a mass/charge ( m / z ) range of 380–1,600 in proﬁ  le mode. The MS/MS analysis of the ﬁ ve most intense peptide ions per scan is recorded in the LTQ mass analyzer in centroid mode (top ﬁ  ve method). Additional MS conditions: spray voltage 1.9–2.1 kV; normal-ized collision energy 35 %; dynamic exclusion 120 s; activation  q  = 0.25 and activation time 30 ms. Detailed MS conditions are provided in [ 6 ].
provided in [ 6 ].      3.    From each IPG strip fraction, 3 μl are loaded onto an in-house packed column and analyzed with a 2.5 h gradient (washing with 0.1 % formic acid for 20 min and elution with 95 % ace-tonitrile/0.1 % formic acid from 2 to 45 % at a ﬂ  ow rate of 200 nl/min).              1.    MS raw ﬁ  les are searched against a decoy mouse database uti-lizing BioWorks and SEQUEST. Search parameters are as fol-lows: peptide mass tolerance, 20 ppm; fragment ion mass tolerance, 1 Da; enzyme, trypsin; missed cleavage sites, up to two; only tryptic peptides allowed; static modiﬁ  cation, cysteine carboxyamidomethylation; variable modiﬁ  cation, methionine oxidation.   3.3  ESI-LC-MS/MS3.4  Data Analysis3.4.1  Proteome Proﬁ  lingIEF Peptide and Phosphopeptide Analysis
300   2.    Protein and peptide identiﬁ  cations are ﬁ  ltered using the  following parameters: Delta CN value (cross correlation nor-malized) is 0.08; X correlation values versus ion charge state 1.9 (+1), 2.7 (+2), 3.5 (+3). Minimum distinct peptides per protein: 2.            1.    For phosphoprotein identiﬁ  cation,  steps 1   and  2  of Subheading  3.4.1   are performed by including in the search parameters  serine (S), threonine (T) and tyrosine (Y) phos-phorylation as variable modiﬁ  cations ( see   Note 12  ).      2.    The algorithm used for database search provides a probability score which is indicative of the reliability of the phosphopep-tide identiﬁ  cation.      3.    Besides the probability score, MS/MS spectra should be man-ually interrogated to conﬁ  rm the identiﬁ  cation of a phosphor-ylation site in a peptide sequence. Phosphopeptide hits resulting from the protein database search are manually
checked for the 98, 49, or 33 amu mass-shifted peaks for sin-gle, double, or triple charged ions, respectively. These  m / z  sig-nals result from the neutral loss of phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4 ) from the precursor and respective b- and y-type fragment ions during the collision- induced dissociation (CID)-MS/MS frag-mentation process. Due to the low stoichiometry of phosphor-ylation, spectra with a 98, 49, or 33 amu mass-shift loss signal of the precursor ion that is greater than 0.4 % of the base peak are considered valid phosphopeptide hits ( see   Note 13  ).      4.    In case of multiple potential phosphorylation sites for a given peptide, phosphorylation site assignment depends exclusively on the observation of neutral loss of H 3 PO 4  (98 Da) in the sequence of b- or y-type ions in one of S, T, or Y residues that could be phosphorylated ( see   Note 14  ). An example of manual phosphosite assignment is shown in Fig.  2 .         4    Notes
4    Notes      1.    There are different options for IPG lengths and pH ranges according to the application of interest. For high amounts of starting material to be loaded, longer IPG strips are more appropriate. For phosphorylation studies, IPG strips with a pH range toward more acidic values are recommended [ 2 ,  10 ].      2.    A minimum amount of approx. 30 mg brain tissue is required to obtain a synaptosomal fraction. When studying brain regions with lower tissue weight, pooling is necessary to study the syn-aptosomal proteome.      3.    The crude synaptosome fraction at the interface of the 1.2 M/0.8 M sucrose gradient appears as a “white cloud.” 3.4.2  Phosphoprotein AnalysisGiuseppina Maccarrone and Michaela D. Filiou
301Absorption of the interphase can be performed by a syringe and is the step that introduces the highest variability in the synaptosome enrichment protocol.      4.    The sample solubility can be increased by adding some drops of 1 M NaOH.      5.    For synaptosome enrichment quality control,  speciﬁ  c antibod ies for pre- and post- synaptic proteins can be used for assessing the enrichment of both pre- and post-synaptic fractions. As a negative control, a nuclear-speciﬁ  c antibody can be used (nuclei should not be present in the synaptosomal fraction). As positive controls commercially available synaptosome prep-arations can be used. For optimal monitoring of the enrichment procedure aliquots of all centrifugation steps can be loaded and analyzed. For a representative example  see  [ 6 ].      6.    The protein amount loaded on the IPG strip depends on its length and pI range as well as sample type. We recommend
following the guidelines of the IPG strip manufacturer.

302synaptosome protein extracts we load 300 and 200 μg protein onto IPG strips, 17 and 11 cm (pH 3.5–4.5), respectively.      7.    Urea concentration should be decreased in order to avoid the inhibition of trypsin activity. The maximum total volume that can be loaded on the IPG strip is provided in the guidelines of the IPG strip manufacturer. The dilution volume should be accordingly calculated.      8.    The use of Lys-C and trypsin enhances the number of proteo-lytic peptides with Lys and Arg at the C-terminus for highly complex protein mixtures. A combination of different restric-tion enzymes can be used according to sample and application requirements.      9.    The advantage of the automated program is that after IEF completion the electric current is kept at a constant value of 50 μA, thus maintaining the resolution of the pI-based peptide separation.      10.    The peptide extraction by formic acid is very efﬁ  cient due to
the low percentage and thin layer of polyacrylamide in the IPG strip. The removal of the mineral oil from the peptide extracts is crucial to obtain high-quality MS data and avoid polymers.  Hexane extraction does not have a negative impact on peptide extraction efﬁ  cacy [ 2 ].      11.    Desalting/ﬁ  ltering prior to mass spectrometry analysis is to our experience required so as to eliminate salts and other ion- suppressor compounds which reduce the efﬁ  ciency of the ion-ization process and result in low intensive peaks, compromising the peptide/protein identiﬁ  cation.      12.    Under normal conditions, phosphorylation generally occurs more often on S and T residues. Phosphorylation on Y residues accounts for less than 1 % of the  O -phosphorylated residues in a protein sequence.      13.    As in this protocol no phosphoprotein enrichment step pre-cedes phosphopeptide analysis, the number of identiﬁ  ed phos-
phopeptides is lower compared to phosphoproteome-targeted analyses due to the low stoichiometry of phosphorylation in a peptide mixture. Strategies exclusively directed to phospho-peptide analysis may include a phosphoprotein enrichment step prior to IEF, as previously described [ 11 ].      14.    It should be noted that the unambiguous assignment of phos-phorylation sites in phosphopeptides with multiple potential phosphorylation sites can be hindered by gas-phase phosphate group rearrangement reactions occurring under  CID-MS/MS conditions [ 12 ].

The transience of this post-transla tional modiﬁ  cation and the generally low abundance of phosphoproteins require speciﬁ  c enrichment and/or detection steps prior to analysis. Here, we describe three gel-based approaches for the analysis of differen-tially expressed phosphoproteins. These approaches comprise (1) the sequential ﬂ  uorescence staining of
two-dimensional (2-D) gels using Pro-Q ®  Diamond and SYPRO ®  Ruby dyes to visualize and quantify phosphoproteins in total cellular lysates as well as (2) afﬁ  nity enrichment of phosphoproteins in conjunc-tion with sequential ﬂ  uorescence staining of the 2-D gels and (3) afﬁ  nity enrichment of proteins prior to pre-electrophoretic ﬂ  uorescence labeling and 2-D gel electrophoresis.

Moreover, protein phosphorylation/dephos-phorylation driven by speciﬁ  c kinases/phosphatases is involved in the
information transmission within a cell and is part of the communica-tion system of cells with their environment [ 2 ]. Thus, the unambigu-ous characterization of the phosphorylation status of proteins in response to a certain stimuli or environmental changes is crucial to gain a better knowledge of cell signaling processes and in addition of vital biological events. Various methods are available to characterize and identify these post-translational modiﬁ  ed proteins. Beside gel-free, mass spectrometry-based approaches that enable the study of the modiﬁ  ed amino acids on the peptide as well as on the pro-tein level [ 3 ], different approaches based on two-dimensional gel
306electro phoresis (2-D GE) have been successfully applied [ 2 ,  4 – 6 ]. This method has a high resolution capacity and enables the direct visualization of phosphorylation changes of proteins. The attachment of a phosphate group to a protein or the removal of it alters the net charge of this protein and thus, leads to a shift in migration at the isoelectric point level [ 2 ]. This shift can then be easily monitored by 2-D GE.  However, main difﬁ  culties of studying phosphoproteins arise from the low stoichiometry of phosphorylation as well as from their low abundance [ 7 ]. To overcome these problems, speciﬁ  c detection strategies have been developed, e.g. ﬂ  uorescence-based gel stains, such as Pro-Q ®  Diamond [ 8 ]. This non-covalent ﬂ  uo-rescence stain selectively targets phosphoproteins in gels and the signal intensity of each spot correlates with the number of phos-phate groups attached to either serine, threonine or tyrosine resi-
dues of the speciﬁ  c protein [ 9 ].  To circumvent the limitations of the low abundance of phos-phoproteins, various enrichment methods have been introduced as well. One of these techniques is based on the use of antibodies against speciﬁ  c phosphoamino acids for immunoprecipitation of proteins [ 10 ]. Another frequently used method utilizes immobi-lized metal ion afﬁ  nity chromatography (IMAC) [ 11 ]. Using IMAC proteins that carry a phosphate group on any amino acid are selectively bound by the metal ion afﬁ  nity chromatography resin [ 12 ] and thus, can further be separated from unphosphory-lated proteins.  In addition to the ability to detect and identify these highly biological relevant proteins, the study of the changes of the phos-phorylation status of proteins is essential. For differential expres-sion analysis, the applied approaches comprise often a sequence of several detection and/or fractionation methods. The sequential
use of Pro-Q ®  Diamond with a total ﬂ  uorescence stain, such as SYPRO ®  Ruby, enables the measurement of the relative phosphor-ylation level by normalizing the phospho-speciﬁ  c ﬂ uorescence sig-nal to the total ﬂ  uorescence signal of each individual spot [ 13 ]. Consequently, this allows the assessment of the altered phosphory-lation status of the individual protein [ 13 ]. Alternatively, two- dimensional ﬂ  uorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) in combination with Pro-Q ®  Diamond [ 14 ] or preceded by a prefractionation step has frequently been applied to detect changes in the phosphorylation level of protein [ 6 ,  15 ].  As it is obvious, various gel-based approaches have been estab-lished and applied to analyze phosphoproteins. In this chapter, we describe in detail the workﬂ  ows of three different 2-D gel-based approaches that enable both detection and quantitation of phos-
phoproteins ( see  Fig.  1 ). Beside 2-D separation of total cell lysates combined with sequential staining, in particular Pro-Q ®  Diamond and SYPRO ®  Ruby, afﬁ  nity enrichment of proteins was used in Birgit Steinberger and Corina Mayrhofer
307conjunction with either sequential staining of the gels ( see  Fig.  2 ) or pre-electrophoretic ﬂ  uorescence labeling of the puriﬁ  ed phos-phoproteins prior to 2-D GE ( see  Fig.  3 ). Finally, the proteins were silver stained to enable manual spot picking for subsequent mass spectrometric analysis. In a recent study, the applicability of these approaches to analyze scarce samples, e.g. obtained from ex vivo experiments, was compared [ 16 ]. This study showed that the approach comprising afﬁ  nity enrichment and ﬂ  uorescence tagging of the proteins was most suitable for the analysis of small amounts of phosphoproteins and subsequent mass spectrometry-based   Fig. 1    Overview of different gel-based approaches to analyse phosphoproteins. In the ﬁ  rst approach ( light grey  ), total cell lysates are directly separated by 2-D GE and the gels are sequentially post-stained using a
phosphospeciﬁ  c stain, visualizing the phosphoproteins content followed by a total ﬂ  uorescence stain. The second approach ( grey  ) consists of an enrichment step to purify the phosphoproteins using afﬁ  nity chroma-tography and subsequent separation by 2-D GE and sequential post-staining. In the third described approach ( dark grey   ), afﬁ  nity-enriched proteins are labeled with ﬂ  uorescence dyes for differential analysis prior to gel electrophoresis. The sample preparation steps include sample clean up and the use of a protein concentration assay. Copyright Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

Remove the bottom part of the column and loosen the cap ( see   Note 12  ).      4.    Place the column in a 50 mL tube and centrifuge at 1,000 ×  g  for 1 min at 4 °C. Discard the ﬂ  ow through.      5.    Pipette 5 mL Binding/Wash buffer onto the column.      6.    Place the column again in the 50 mL conical tube and centri-fuge at 1,000 ×  g  for 1 min at 4 °C. Discard the ﬂ  ow through.      7.    Cap the bottom part of the column and add the diluted lysate of  step 1  . Screw the cap and upend three times.      8.    Incubate the column on a platform rocker for 30 min at 4 °C.
9.    Remove the bottom plug and place the column in a new 50 mL conical tube. Centrifuge the column at 1,000 ×  g  for 1 min at 4 °C. The ﬂ  ow through is stored on ice.      10.    Wash the column with 5 mL Binding/Wash buffer as described in  steps 5  – 6 . Repeat twice for a total of three wash steps.      11.    Cap the bottom of the column and transfer the column to a new 50 mL conical tube. Add 1 mL elution buffer and incu-bate at room temperature for 3 min. Within these 3 min agi-tate the column three times.      12.    Remove the plug, transfer the column to a new 50 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 1,000 ×  g  for 1 min at 4 °C. Repeat this step four times.      13.    Pool the eluted fractions (total volume 5 mL).      14.    Use the ﬂ  ow through of  step 9   and repeat  steps 2  – 13  with a new enrichment column, except that the ﬂ  ow through obtained in  step 9   is discarded.      15.    Pipette the eluates from both columns separately into the
upper chamber of the iCON™ concentrator centrifugal devices.      16.    Centrifuge at 3,000 ×  g  for approximately 45 min at 4 °C in a swinging-bucket rotor until the eluate of the ﬁ  rst column has a volume between 120 and 150 μL and the eluate of the  second used column has a volume between 50 and 80 μL ( see   Note 13  ).      17.    Pool the concentrated eluates and store at −80 °C for later use or continue with Subheading  3.3 .      3.2  Afﬁ  nity Enrichment Using IMAC ColumnsBirgit Steinberger and Corina Mayrhofer
315       1.    Use the 2-D Clean-up Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( see   Note 14  ).      2.    Redissolve your sample in an appropriate buffer (e.g. labeling buffer, pH 8.5, as described in Subheading  2.3 ).      3.    Determine the protein concentration of your redissolved sample.      4.    (Optional) Pre-electrophoretic ﬂ  uorescence labeling.    (a)    Check the pH of your sample with a pH indicator strip by pipetting 0.5 μL of your sample onto the indicator strip ( see   Note 15  ).     (b)    Reconstitute the ﬂ  uorescent dyes in DMF to generate a working solution according to the manufacturer’s proto-col ( see   Note 16  ).      (c)    Add 4 pmol/ μg protein of reconstituted CyDye™ minimal dye to your sample. Vortex for 5 s and centrifuge at maxi-mum speed for 10 s.

Vortex for 5 s and centrifuge at maximum speed for 10 s.      (f )    Put the sample on ice for 10 min in the dark.     (g)    The samples can be stored at −80 °C or can be further subjected to 2-D gel electrophoresis (2-D GE).                1.    Mix your samples with the appropriate amount of rehydration buffer ( see   Note 17  ).      2.    Leave the samples for 10 min at room temperature.      3.    Centrifuge the sample at maximum speed for 2 min at room temperature to remove any insoluble materials and bubbles.      4.    Pipette the samples into the designated lanes of the IPG focus-ing tray without introducing any bubbles.      5.    Peel apart the IPG strip without touching the gel side (starting from the acidic end to the other end). Place each IPG strip with the gel side down into the designated sample lane of the tray ( see   Note 18  ).      6.    Cover each strip with 2 mL mineral oil to prevent the dehydra-tion of the gel.

316   9.    At this point the strips can either be stored in, for example, a 15 mL tube or a disposable rehydration tray at −80 °C or immediately continue with  step 10  .      10.    Put the strips with the gel side up into a disposable rehydration tray and cover each single strip with 2 mL reduction equilibra-tion buffer. Incubate at room temperature for 19 min with gentle agitation ( see   Note 20  ).      11.    Immediately remove the strips and put it into a new disposable rehydration tray. Cover each strip with 2 mL alkylation equili-bration buffer. Incubate at room temperature for 19 min with gentle agitation.      12.    During  step 11  , melt the 1 % agarose solution (sealing solu-tion) and store at 70 °C till use.      13.    Remove the strips from the rehydration tray by holding one side of the strip with forceps and carefully align each strip onto the top of a second-dimension SDS polyacrylamide gel (for
example: CriterionTM, Bio Rad) without any air bubbles between the strip and the gel.      14.    Load the molecular weight standard into the designated well ( see   Note 21  ).      15.    Quickly overlay the strip with 1–2 mL sealing solution. Avoid introducing air bubbles. Let the sealing solution solidify for approximately 2 min.      16.    Separate the proteins in 1× SDS running buffer.      17.    Open the gel plates with the use of a spatula. Carefully transfer the gels into a cleaned container, add some water to prevent the gels from drying out and immediately continue either with  steps 18   or  19 .      18.    In case of pre-electrophoretic labeling, visualize the ﬂ  uores-cence images of the gels, as stated in Subheading  3.6 ,  step 1  .      19.    In case of sequential post staining, handle the gels as described in Subheading  3.5  ( see   Note 22  ).          Carry out all steps at room temperature unless otherwise speciﬁ  ed,
according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( see   Note 23  ). Use a shaking platform.    1.    Soak the 2D gels in ﬁ  xation solution for 30 min. Discard the ﬁ xation solution.      2.    Incubate the gels in ﬁ  xation solution overnight at 4 °C. Discard the ﬁ xation solution.      3.    Wash the gels three times for 15 min with water. Change the water in-between.   3.5  Sequential Gel Staining3.5.1  Pro-Q ®  Diamond StainingBirgit Steinberger and Corina Mayrhofer
317   4.    Add the Pro-Q ®  Diamond solution and incubate for 2 h in the dark. Discard the staining solution.      5.    Destain the gels 30 min with the destain solution in the dark. Repeat this step twice.      6.    Wash the gels four times for 15 min with water in the dark.      7.    Continue with image acquisition of the gels (as stated in Subheading  3.6 ,  step 1  ).        Carry out all steps at room temperature unless otherwise speciﬁ  ed, according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( see   Note 23  ). Use a shaking platform.    1.    Following image acquisition put the gels into new containers and add the SYPRO ®  Ruby solution. Incubate overnight in the dark. Remove the SYPRO ®  Ruby solution.      2.    Rinse the gels with wash solution for 30 min in the dark. Discard the wash solution.      3.    Rinse the gels with water for 15 min twice in the dark. Discard the washing solutions.      4.    Continue with image acquisition (as stated in Subheading  3.6 ,
step 1  ).             1.    After image acquisition, proceed with the silver staining proto-col to visualize the proteins (according to [ 17 ]).      2.    Put the gels in a new tray and wash them in water for 30 min.      3.    Incubate the gels for 1 min in sensitizing solution. Remove the sensitizing solution.      4.    Wash three times for 20 s with water. Remove the water after each washing step ( see   Note 24  ).      5.    Add the silver nitrate solution and incubate the gel for 20 min at 4 °C in the dark.      6.    Repeat  step 3  .      7.    Add development solution and remove it when the solution turns slightly turbid. Add fresh development solution and incubate the gel until it is sufﬁ  ciently stained. Discard the solution.      8.    Wash with water for 20 s. Discard the water.      9.    Incubate the gels in stop solution for 5 min. Remove the stop solution.      10.    Wash the gels for 10 min with water. Repeat this step twice.
Discard the water after each washing step.      11.    The gels can now be stored in storage solution at 4 °C.       3.5.2  SYPRO ®  Ruby Staining3.5.3  Silver StainingGel-Based Phosphoprotein Analysis
318         1.    Visualize the ﬂ  uorescence images using an appropriate  instrument (e.g. Typhoon™ Trio scanner, GE Healthcare or VersaDoc™ MP 4000 Imaging System, Bio-Rad) at an excitation/emission wavelength corresponding to the used ﬂ  uorescent stain/dyes ( see   Note 25  ). Images can further be displayed and analyzed by appropriate software (e.g. PDQuest advanced version 8.0.1, Bio Rad).      2.    Remove the gels from the imaging systems and continue with the silver staining protocol ( see  Subheading  3.5.3  ) to visualize the proteins for subsequent manual spot picking.       4    Notes         1.    The use of phosphatase/protease inhibitor cocktails is essential to prevent the degradation of proteins and the removal of phosphate groups from proteins.      2.    The volume of the lysis buffer is dependent on the wet weight cell pellet. Prepare the lysis buffer volume according to the weight of each cell pellet as well as to the number of samples.
Add protease and phosphatase inhibitors to the lysis buffer freshly before use.      3.    Other protein concentration assays can be used as well. However, no single available protein assay is compatible with all buffer components. Therefore, select an appropriate assay method that is most compatible with your samples and the buffer components (e.g. BCA Protein Assay—Reducing Agent Compatible, Thermo Fisher).      4.    For each column load you need approximately 25 mL Lysis/Binding/Wash buffer containing 0.25 % CHAPS as well as 5 mL elution buffer containing 0.25 % CHAPS. Prepare the volume according to the number of samples.      5.    Other systems can be used as well, such as ReadyPrep™ 2-D Cleanup Kit (Bio Rad).      6.    Other commercial available ﬂ  uorescent dyes can be used as well, e.g. Refraction-2D™ G-dyes (NH DyeAGNOSTICS, Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany).      7.    Prepare the equilibration buffer at least 3 h prior to use, con-
sidering that it takes the buffer components a while to dissolve completely. To avoid carbamylation, do not heat urea contain-ing buffers above 37 °C. Furthermore, add only small amounts of water at once, to prevent that the total volume of 200 mL will not be exceeded.      8.    It is more convenient to prepare a 10× running buffer: 0.25 M Tris, 1.92 M glycine and 1 % SDS (w/v). Weigh 30.3 g Tris, 3.6  Image Acquisition and AnalysisBirgit Steinberger and Corina Mayrhofer
319144 g glycine and 10 g SDS and make up to 1 L with water. Dilute 100 mL of the 10× running buffer in 900 mL water.      9.    Use a phosphate-free wash buffer and include EDTA-free  protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Other cell lysis buffers (e.g. RIPA buffer; Radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors can be used as well. If performing afﬁ  nity chromatography, check the compatibility of the lysis buffer with the columns prior to use.      10.    For highest accuracy use the same dilution buffer for standard samples as for experimental samples.      11.    Since the amount of sample is limited, we reduced the volume for the test tube procedure. If performing the test tube proce-dure, please make sure that your photometer is usable for less volumes.      12.    To ensure an optimal ﬂ  ow through the column during the cen-trifugation step always loosen the cap of the column before the centrifugation step.
13.    In general, 2,500–4,500 ×  g  can be set using a swinging bucket rotor and 5,000–7,000 ×  g  can be set for a ﬁ  xed-angle rotor. Accordingly, the centrifugation time has to be adapted. Always check the sample volume during the centrifugation process.      14.    The buffer used to redissolve the precipitated protein pellet should be compatible with the next experimental steps including protein concentration assay, ﬂ  uorescence labeling, and 2-D GE.      15.    Phosphoproteins are known to be acidic and in case the pH of your sample solution is below 8 add 2-D compatible labeling buffer pH 9.5.      16.    The working solution is not stable and should be used immediately.      17.    The ﬁ  nal volume depends on the used IPG strip size (cm) (e.g. for 11 cm strips the ﬁ  nal volume is 200 μL). Follow the guide-lines provided by the respective manufacturer.      18.    Remove any air bubbles between the sample solution and the
strip by carefully tapping the IPG strip or remove the strip and place it again, from one side to the other gradually.      19.    The following focusing steps are used for 11 cm strips with broad pH gradients (pH 4–7 or pH 3–10 nonlinear): Passive rehydration is followed by four steps of pre-isoelectric focusing with rapid increase up to 100 V for 30 min, 200 V for 30 min, 500 V for 30 min and 1,000 V for 30 min. Isoelectric focusing is performed with linear increase up to 4,000 V over 1 h, fol-lowed by a rapid increase to 6,000 V. The focusing step is stopped when a total of 23,000 Vh is reached.

strips are equilibrated in a disposable rehydration tray (11 cm strips). If the strips are in a 15 mL tube, then 10 mL equilibra-tion buffer are required per strip (11 cm strips).      21.    The PeppermintStick phosphoprotein molecular weight stan-dard contains two phosphorylated (ovalbumin and bovine β-casein of 45.0 and 23.6 kDa, respectively) and four non- phosphorylated proteins ( β-galactosidase, BSA, avidin, and lysozyme of 116.25, 66.2, 18.0, and 14.4 kDa, respectively). This marker serves as control for the Pro-Q Diamond staining process.      22.    Each gel tray for the different post staining solutions has to be carefully cleaned prior to use.      23.    The required volume of each solution is dependent on the size of the used tray. Use a container similar in size of the gel to save the expensive staining solutions and add enough solution volume to fully immerse the gels. Use the Pro-Q Diamond stain solution only once.
24.    The incubation time for the washing steps must be strictly adhered to.      25.    Images can be obtained with any ﬂ  uorescence capture device. Cy5 has an excitation/emission maxima of 649/670 nm. Cy2 and Cy3 exhibit an excitation/emission maxima of 489/506 nm and 550/570 nm, respectively. Pro-Q Diamond dye absorbs maximally at 555 nm and emits maximally at 580 nm. SYPRO Ruby dye absorbs maximally in the ultravio-let region and has also an excitation maximum at 450 nm. Recommended ﬁ  lter settings for different instruments are provided by the respective manufacturers.

A previous protocol for afﬁ  nity electrophoresis that uses polyacrylamide-bound Mn 2+ -Phos-tag and Laemmli’s buffer system under condi-tions of alkaline pH has limitations in separating certain phosphoproteins. The current protocol provides
major improvements in separation and detection of various phosphorylated protein species. We here introduce two neutral-pH gel systems buffered with Bis–Tris–HCl and Tris–AcOH, respectively, for Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE, and we also discuss their characteristics on the basis of comparative studies on phos-phorylation proﬁ  ling of proteins with a wide range of molecular masses. Each analytical procedure, from the beginning of gel preparation to the end of electrophoresis, requires 2.5–5 h with either buffer system.

In living cells, many pro-
teins are continuously and dynamically phosphorylated and dephosphorylated at speciﬁ  c amino acid residues under the regula-tion of complex signaling networks [ 2 ,  3 ], resulting in the produc-tion of a variety of phosphoproteins with various states of phosphorylation. This reversible PTM is catalyzed by the opposing activities of large families of protein kinase and phosphatase enzymes. For example, the human genome encodes more than 500 protein kinases [ 4 ] and about 150 protein phosphatases [ 5 ]. These numbers reﬂ  ect the importance and the complexity of pro-tein phosphorylation. Abnormal phosphorylation resulting from an 1.1  General Background
324imbalance in the enzymatic reactions of kinases and phospha tases has been implicated in a wide range of human diseases, including cancers [ 6 ] and neurodegenerative disorders [ 7 ]. Therefore, effec-tive analytical strategies for quantitative and qualitative monitoring of alterations in the phosphorylation states of certain proteins are essential tools for studies on the proteome, particularly in relation to the elucidation of the molecular origins of diseases and the rational molecular design of drugs.  In recent years, the large-scale identiﬁ  cation of phosphopro-teins and their sites of phosphorylation has been made possible through dramatic advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods of shotgun proteomics, coupled with improvements in MS instrumentation and the development of better methods for the enrichment of phosphopeptides through enzymatic digestion [ 8 ]. MS-based techniques also provide several strategies for the
quantitative analysis of phosphorylation, particularly the quantita-tive determination of levels of phosphorylation of individual resi-dues in peptide digests. Under certain biological conditions, even a single protein can show heterogeneity in its phosphorylation sta-tus. In many cases, the protein can be reversibly phosphorylated at several residues, resulting in the simultaneous presence of multiple forms of the protein that are phosphorylated at different sites and with different stoichiometry. These distinct phosphorylated species can act either independently or synergistically, and their presence is closely associated with speciﬁ  c cellular events [ 9 ]. To understand the function of a given protein in detail, it is therefore important to be able to determine its overall phosphorylation status, as well as the states of phosphorylation of individual sites within the protein. Because MS-based strategies permit the analysis of digested pep-
tides rather than intact proteins, these techniques are not ideally suited to the identiﬁ  cation of the many individual phosphorylated species that can be formed from a particular protein or its alterna-tively spliced isoforms (splice variants) ( see  Fig.  1c ).   Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), involving iso-electric focusing (IEF) and sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacryl amide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), is a classical and powerful ana-lytical strategy that can be used to separate and analyze complex proteomic samples, such as cell or tissue lysates, by means of dif-ferences in the electrical charges (p I ) and the apparent molecular masses of the constituent proteins [ 8 ]. In contrast to MS-based strategies, 2-DE permits the study of intact proteins, and the tech-nique can be used to analyze the distinct protein species produced by various PTMs such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, sulfa-
tion, or partial proteolysis. The various modiﬁ  ed species appear as individual distinct migration spots along the horizontal and/or vertical axes on the 2-DE gel. By combining 2-DE with metabolic labeling with a radioactive [ 32 P]orthophosphate isotope [ 10 ] or with gel staining by a Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein-speciﬁ  c ﬂ uorescent dye [ 11 ], the stoichiometry of phosphorylation can be Emiko Kinoshita-Kikuta et al.
325readily determined from the intensities of the spots corresponding to individual phosphorylated species formed from a particular protein. The site of phosphorylation of the separated target can be conﬁ rmed by means of Western blotting analysis using the appro-priate site-speciﬁ  c anti-phosphoprotein antibody or by an MS-based technique after in-gel digestion. However, it is difﬁ  cult to separate phosphorylated species that have similar p I  values (i.e., proteins that have the same numbers of phosphate groups, but in which the phosphate groups are present at different phosphorylation sites within the molecule) by means of the 2-DE procedure. Therefore, the conventional analytical strategy has limitations in respect of detailed monitoring of the phosphorylation status of individual proteins.    We have developed the Phos-tag (phosphate-binding tag) technol ogy as a novel strategy for the analysis of protein phosphorylation (Phos-
tag Consortium,   http:/ /www.phos-tag.com/english/index.html    ). The Phos-tag technology utilizes an alkoxide-bridged dinuclear metal complex of Phos-tag {1,3-bis[bis(pyridin-2- ylmethyl)amino]propan-2-olato dizinc(II) complex} that selectively captures 1.2  Phos-tag Technology as a Novel Strategy for the Analysis of Protein Phosphorylation  Fig. 1    Phosphate-afﬁ  nity SDS-PAGE for the detection of shifts in mobilities of phosphoprotein species.

To date, technologies based on derivatives of Phos-tag have contributed extensively in the development of a range of practical procedures for phosphopro-teomic research. Among the methods that have been developed are immobilized zinc(II) ion-afﬁ  nity chromatography for the enrichment of phosphoproteins [ 13 – 16 ] and phosphopeptides [ 15 – 20 ], surface plasmon resonance techniques for the detection of phosphopeptides [ 21 – 23 ], a wide variety of lab-on-a-chip tech-niques that use various array formats for high-throughput proﬁ  ling of protein phosphorylation [ 24 – 27 ], and Western blotting tech-niques for the detection of phosphoproteins on protein-blotting membranes [ 26 – 29 ]. We have also shown that a novel type of phosphate-afﬁ  nity SDS-PAGE using the Phos-tag molecule (Phos- tag SDS-PAGE) can be used to detect shifts in the mobilities of
phosphoproteins in comparison with those of their nonphosphory-lated counterparts [ 29 ,  30 ].    We synthesized a Phos-tag ligand with a pendent acrylamide moiety (Fig.  1a ) and we used this as a novel additive (comonomer) in a separating gel for use in Laemmli’s method [ 31 ]. The analytical technique based on this Phos-tag gel is now widely used in life- science laboratories for the separation and detection of phospho-proteins. The principle underlying our analytical strategy involves monitoring changes in the electrophoretic mobilities of phosphor-ylated proteins that result from reversible trapping of their phos-phate moieties by Phos-tag molecules immobilized in the gel; these changes are independent of the nature of the individual phosphor-ylated amino acid residues (Fig.  1b ). At ﬁ  rst, we tried to use polyacrylamide- bound Zn 2+ –Phos-tag in SDS-PAGE. However, the expected phosphate-selective shift in mobility was not observed
under the usual SDS-PAGE conditions adopted in Laemmli’s pro-cedure. It is likely that the conditions that exist during the electro-phoresis, such as an abundance of SDS anions and alkaline buffers, are not conducive to selective trapping of phosphate by the zinc(II) complex. We therefore examined whether complexes of other met-als (Mn 2+ , Cu 2+ , Co 2+ , Fe 2+ , and Ni 2+ ) might function as phosphate- trapping molecules under the conditions present during SDS-PAGE. We found that a polyacrylamide-bound manganese(II) analog (Mn 2+ –Phos-tag) is indeed capable of acting as a phosphate- afﬁ nity site in the Laemmli buffer system. In a separating gel  containing copolymerized acrylamide-bound Mn 2+ –Phos-tag, the degree of migration of a phosphoprotein is less than that of its nonphosphorylated counterpart, because the tag molecules trap the phosphoprotein reversibly during electrophoresis ( see  Fig.  1b ). On this basis, we developed a novel type of phosphate-afﬁ  nity
SDS-PAGE for the separation of phosphoproteins from their cor-responding nonphosphorylated analogs. We named this technique 1.3  Existing Protocol for Phos-tag SDS-PAGE (Mn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE) with Polyacrylamide-Bound Mn 2+ –Phos-tag and Laemmli’s Buffer SystemEmiko Kinoshita-Kikuta et al.
327Mn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE. By subsequent general colorimetric gel staining or Western blotting with a phosphorylation- independent antibody, it is possible to detect both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated proteins simultaneously. This permits temporal changes in the ratio of phosphorylated to nonphosphorylated forms produced by the reactions of certain protein kinases and phosphatases to be determined quantitatively by means of Mn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE without the need for any special apparatus, radioisotopes, or chemical labels. In addition, this afﬁ  nity electro-phoresis technique has the following major advantages.    1.    Various phosphorylated forms of a single protein can be detected as multiple migration bands on the gel [ 30 ].      2.    Phosphoprotein species that contain identical numbers of phos-phate groups but in which the phosphate groups are present at different locations within the molecule can be separated [ 32 ].
3.    Unstable His- and Asp-phosphorylated proteins involved in a two-component signaling system can be detected simultane-ously during their phosphotransfer reactions [ 32 ].      4.    A phosphate-afﬁ  nity 2-DE procedure coupled with other elec-trophoresis methods permits more-detailed analyses of the phosphorylated congeners of a particular protein and its splice variants ( see  Fig.  1c ) [ 33 ,  34 ].      This technique is therefore appropriate for quantitative and qualitative analyses of temporal and spatial variations of proteins with different phosphorylation states in vitro or in vivo without the need to fragment the phosphorylated proteins into peptides with concomitant loss of signiﬁ  cant information regarding the molecu-lar weights of these protein species [ 35 – 39 ].  Since it was ﬁ  rst reported in 2006 [ 29 ], Mn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS- PAGE has been used by many research groups to determine the
phosphorylation status of various proteins [ 40 ]. Because of the simplicity of the procedure, acrylamide-bound Phos-tag studies can be performed at any laboratory that is equipped with the appa-ratus and reagents for normal SDS-PAGE. However, there remain some problems in the separation of certain phosphoproteins by Mn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE. For example, it was reported that no up-shifted band of tau protein, a classical hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, was observed following treatment by a certain tyrosine kinase [ 32 ], although the phosphorylation of a tyrosine moiety was later conﬁ  rmed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. A similarly unfortunate result has been reported in the analysis of the phosphorylation status of a human cardiac troponin T [ 41 ], a diagnostic marker for myocardial infarction. Furthermore, the Mn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE procedure does not permit the detection of any shift in the mobility of pepsin, a standard phos-
phoprotein, in comparison with that of its dephosphorylated form. Neutral Phos-Tag SDS-PAGE System
328Mn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE, therefore, has some limitations in the analysis of protein phosphorylation. An additional disadvantage is that Mn 2+ –Phos-tag gels, which are cast in an alkaline buffer, are unstable during long-term storage, and tend to break down into acrylic acids after 1–2 months [ 42 ], causing changes in the pore sizes of the gels that result in    poor resolution in subsequent SDS- PAGE studies.     To overcome the limitations described above, we developed an improved Phos-tag SDS-PAGE method for advanced phosphory-lation proﬁ  ling of proteins, and we named this new method Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE [ 42 ]. Marked improvements in the separation and detection of phosphoprotein species are achieved by using a dizinc(II) complex of acrylamide-bound Phos-tag ( see  Fig.  1a ) in conjunction with a neutral-pH gel system buffered with 2-[bis(2- hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol (Bis–
Tris) and hydrochloric acid (Bis–Tris–HCl). The utility of the newly modiﬁ  ed method has been demonstrated by visualization of novel up-shifted bands of typical phosphoproteins, such as pepsin, recombinant human tau protein treated in vitro with various tyro-sine kinases, or the intracellular signaling molecule β-catenin. Other research groups have also demonstrated the utility of this system for advanced protein phosphorylation proﬁ  ling [ 43 ,  44 ]. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Zn 2+ –Phos-tag gels cast in a neutral buffer are much more stable during 6 months of stor-age than are the corresponding Mn 2+ –Phos-tag gels. Moreover, storage of the Zn 2+ –Phos-tag gel does not require any special knowhow or equipment. The gel, together with the casting glass plates, is merely wrapped in a Saran wrap to protect it from drying and then stored at room temperature under normal laboratory illu-mination until required. Alternatively, the gels can be stored at
4 °C in a refrigerator. The improved shelf life of the gels makes the Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE method particularly appealing for labo-ratory practice. In summary, we have developed a simple, conve-nient, and reliable protocol for phosphate-afﬁ  nity SDS-PAGE that uses a gel system that can be prepared and stored in house.     The separation and detection of high-molecular-mass proteins generally requires extremely porous polyacrylamide gels that con-tain less than 5 % (w/v) of polyacrylamide. We have previously reported a procedure for Mn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE in which highly porous gels strengthened by homogeneous addition of 0.5 % (w/v) agarose are used for the analysis of large phospho-proteins with molecular masses in excess of 200 kDa [ 37 ,  38 ]. However, in the case of the Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE procedure using a neutral-pH gel system buf fered with Bis–Tris–HCl described in Subheading  1.4 , we found that problems occur in the prepara-
tion of highly porous gels, in that all the protein bands appear as 1.4  An Improved Protocol for Zn 2+ –Phos- tag SDS-PAGE for Advanced Protein Phosphorylation Proﬁ ling1.5  Alternative Protocol for Zn 2+ –Phos- tag SDS-PAGE for the Analysis of Large Phosphoproteins with Molecular Masses in Excess of 200 kDaEmiko Kinoshita-Kikuta et al.
329smeared images because the Bis–Tris-buffered gels have inadequate sieving properties when the concentration of polyacrylamide is less than 4 % (w/v) [ 45 ]. Because Bis–Tris is a weakly basic amine (p K  a  = 6.5 at 20 °C) that is partially protonated at neutral pH val-ues, the free amine species (R 3 N) is converted into an amine radical cation (R 3 N + ·) that can act as a radical quencher during polymer-ization of acrylamide in the presence of ammonium persulfate [ 46 ]. Therefore, the abundant Bis–Tris molecules interfere with the formation of the polyacrylamide gel matrix, particularly at very low concentrations of acrylamide.  To overcome this problem, we developed an alternative proce-dure for the analysis of large phosphoproteins by Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE that uses a neutral-pH gel system buffered with Tris and acetic acid (Tris–AcOH) [ 45 ]. The primary amine Tris (p K  a  = 8.2 at 20 °C) is almost fully protonated at neutral pH values,
and the resulting primary ammonium species (R–NH 3  + ) should cause less inhibition of the polymerization of acrylamide. In fact, the use of the Tris–AcOH buffer system (pH 7.0) permits the pro-duction of a separating gel that shows sieving properties at poly-acrylamide concentrations of less than 4 % (w/v). The utility of our newly adapted Tris–AcOH system has been demonstrated by visu-alization of a novel up-shifted band of a high-molecular-mass pro-tein, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase (ATM; 350 kDa), on a Zn 2+ –Phos-tag gel strengthened with 0.5 % (w/v) agarose.  Therefore, depending on the target proteins, appropriate selection of one of our two current procedures for Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE using systems buffered with Bis–Tris–HCl or Tris–AcOH, respectively, can provide a broad coverage and can give detailed information for large numbers of phosphoproteins with a wide range of molecular weights. The improvements in the detec-
tion of shifts in the mobilities of the proteins are the result of an increase in the afﬁ  nity of the phosphorylated targets for the dizinc(II) complex of Phos-tag Acrylamide under conditions of neutral pH.    Below, we describe a useful protocol that provides improvements in the detection of phosphoproteins that the previous Mn 2+ –Phos- tag SDS-PAGE protocol did not adequately detect. The resolving power of the current Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE methodology permits the determination of the precise phosphorylation status of many phosphoproteins. For example, by applying the current  protocol to a typical standard phosphoprotein (commercially available ovalbumin derived from chicken egg white), we suc-ceeded in characterizing four distinct forms of the protein with different serine phosphorylation states [ 47 ]; these states arise from differences in the phosphorylation status of the Ser-68 and Ser-344 residues. Quantitative analysis showed that the protein
consists of approximately 65 % of the diphosphorylated species, 1.6  Applications of the Current Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE ProtocolNeutral Phos-Tag SDS-PAGE System
33030 % of the species monophosphorylated at Ser-68, 4 % of the species monophosphorylated at Ser-344, and 1 % of the nonphos-phorylated species. The pair of species with a single phosphate group, one at Ser-68 and the other at Ser-344, appeared as two different migration bands on the Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE gel. The older Mn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS- PAGE protocol did not permit this complete proﬁ  ling of the phosphorylation status of ovalbumin.  We have characterized the two neutral-pH gel systems, Bis–Tris–HCl and Tris–AcOH, described above, by reporting compar-ative studies on the separation of a wide range of proteins with molecular masses from 10 to 350 kDa [ 45 ]. For 10–200 kDa cel-lular proteins, the Bis–Tris–HCl system shows a higher resolving power than the Tris–AcOH system in the 2-D ﬂ  uorescence- difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) analysis of certain phos-phoproteins such as histone H3 (15 kDa) or elongation factor 2
(95 kDa). Large differences were also observed in the one- dimensional (1-D) migration patterns of phosphorylated species of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2, 44/42 kDa). These differences arose from changes in the phos-phorylation status of the Thr-202 and Tyr-204 residues in the two buffer systems at the same concentration of Zn 2+ –Phos-tag. The two buffer systems therefore show differences in their separation power and related features in proﬁ  ling of the phosphorylation states of 10–200 kDa proteins. In contrast, shifts in the mobilities of multiply phosphorylated forms of the high-molecular mass pro-tein ATM (350 kDa) could only be detected by using the Tris–AcOH system with a low-concentration polyacrylamide gel strengthened with agarose. We have therefore identiﬁ  ed protocols based on the two Phos-tag SDS-PAGE systems that can be used under neutral pH conditions, the choice of the particular system
being dependent on the nature of the target proteins, which can have wide ranges of molecular weights.    As in the earlier protocol for Mn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE [ 37 ,  38 ], the agarose-containing gel in the Tris–AcOH system for the separa-tion analysis of large phosphoproteins frequently undergoes partial melting as the result of resistive heating effects during electropho-resis and electroblotting. In the electroblotting procedure, in par-ticular, melting of the gel causes it to adhere to the protein-blotting poly(vinylidene diﬂ  uoride) (PVDF) membrane, hampering its removal from the membrane. To circumvent this problem, it is necessary to adapt the protocol to conditions of a relatively lower constant voltage of 3.5 V/cm of distance between the two elec-trodes in the electroblotting unit, and to extend the time for the wet-tank electroblotting procedure to 16 h (overnight). With regard to the detection of protein phosphorylation in complex cell-
lysate samples, the ability to identify up-shifted phosphor ylated 1.7  Limitations of the Current Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE ProtocolEmiko Kinoshita-Kikuta et al.
331forms of a given protein by using the current protocol is entirely dependent upon its immunoreactivity with the corresponding antibody, as in the previous protocol. To determine the sites of phosphorylation of up-shifted phosphorylated species, it is neces-sary to adopt a downstream procedure, such as immunoblotting using high-quality site-speciﬁ  c anti-phosphoprotein antibodies or MS analysis after in-gel digestion. If used in conjunction with high-quality site-speciﬁ  c anti-phosphoprotein antibodies, the gel- based electrophoretic separation procedure is capable of mapping in great depth the sites with a low abundance of phosphorylation on each of the phosphoprotein species that are formed in cell signal-ing. Furthermore, when used in conjunction with advanced MS-based methods, the procedure permits the identiﬁ  cation of novel phosphoprotein species, providing a greater understanding of the detailed properties of particular proteins involved in speciﬁ  c
cellular events ( see  Fig.  1c ). However, this gel-based strategy might have a disadvantage because of its low throughput. In addi-tion, the current Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE protocol is sometimes incapable of showing a shift in the mobility of a phosphoprotein containing an imidazole-phosphate moiety, as produced by auto-phosphorylation of a certain bacterial histidine kinase under the experimental conditions [ 48 ]. The fact that the zinc(II) complex of Phos-tag does not bind readily with a phosphorylated imidazole group under the conditions of neutral SDS-PAGE is a limitation of the current protocol. If such an unfortunate case occurs, we recommend that the experiments are repeated using Mn 2+ –Phos- tag SDS-PAGE; this protocol, which uses an alkaline gel buffer, should solve the problem.   2    Materials ( See   Note 1 )        1.

As a typical example of the Zn 2+ –Phos-tag gel buffered with Tris–AcOH (8 % w/v polyacrylamide, 100 μM Mn 2+ –Phos-tag), a separating gel solution (~7 mL) is prepared by mixing 1.866 mL of acrylamide/bis solution, 1.4 mL of gel buffer (5×), 140 μL of Phos-tag Acrylamide solution, 140 μL of zinc(II) chloride solution (2 equivalents on Phos-tag), 7 μL of TEMED, and 3.412 mL of distilled water in a 50-mL cen-trifuge tube ( see   Note 21  ).      4.    Add 35 μL of APS solution and mix gently.      5.    Transfer the separating gel solution to the gap between the
glass plates, pour a 50 % (v/v) aqueous solution of propan-2- ol on top of the separating gel solution, and allow the gel solution to polymerize for about 20 min at room temperature ( see   Note 22  ; for troubleshooting advice,  see  Table  1 ).       6.    Prepare the stacking gel solution. In a similar manner to the preparation of the separating gel solution, prepare a typical stacking gel solution (~2 mL, 4 % w/v polyacrylamide) buff-ered with Bis–Tris–HCl by mixing 267 μL of acrylamide/bis solution, 715 μL of gel buffer (2.8×), 2 μL of TEMED, and 1,006 μL of distilled water in a 50-mL centrifuge tube. As a typical example of the stacking gel solution buffered with Tris–AcOH (~2 mL, 4 % w/v polyacrylamide), prepare the gel solu-tion by mixing 267 μL of acrylamide/bis solution, 400 μL of gel buffer (5×), 2 μL of TEMED, and 1,321 μL of distilled water in a 50-mL centrifuge tube.      7.    Discard the 50 % (v/v) propan-2-ol solution on the separating
gel and wipe the top surface of the separating gel with a ﬁ  lter paper to remove any residual liquid.      8.    Add 10 μL of APS solution to the stacking gel solution, mix gently, and then pour the solution onto the separating gel.      9.    Insert a sample-well comb and allow the gel solution to polym-erize for about 20 min ( see   Note 23  ) (for troubleshooting advice,  see  Table  1 ).      10.    Carefully remove the sample-well comb from the stacking gel, and assemble the gel plate and electrophoresis apparatus.  After  step 10  , go to Subheading  3.2.2  .      11.    Prepare the separating gel solution for the analysis of large phosphoproteins with molecular masses in excess of 200 kDa. It is not necessary to make a stacking gel in this case.

338(~8.5 mL, 3 % w/v polyacrylamide) containing 0.5 % (w/v) agarose, a separating gel solution (~8.5 mL) is prepared by mixing 0.85 mL of acrylamide/bis solution, 1.7 mL of gel buffer (5×), 34 μL of Phos-tag Acrylamide solution, 34 μL of zinc(II) chloride solution (2 equivalents on Phos-tag), 9 μL of TEMED, and 2.977 mL of distilled water in a 50-mL centri-fuge tube ( see   Note 24   and Fig.  2 ).       12.    Prepare the 1.5 % (w/v) agarose solution. Suspend SeaKem Gold agarose (0.75 g) in 50 mL of distilled water in a 100-mL ﬂ ask and melt the agarose solution completely by using a microwave oven ( see   Note 25  ).      13.    Add 2.833 mL of the hot agarose solution (>90 °C) to the separating gel solution and mix gently (for troubleshooting advice,  see  Table  1 ).      14.    Add 43 μL of APS solution and mix gently.      15.    Transfer the warm gel solution (which should be above the gelling temperature of the agarose) to the gap between the
glass plates, and insert a sample-well comb and allow the acryl-amide to polymerize for about 20 min.      16.

339        1.    Fill the electrode chambers with the running buffer for electro phoresis. Take care not to introduce bubbles onto the bottom surface of the gel set ( see   Note 28  ).      2.    Load the protein samples mixed with the sample-loading dye solution into the wells ( see   Note 29  ).      3.    Attach the leads to the power supply. When you are using gel buffer systems without agarose, run the gels under constant- current conditions of 40 mA/gel at room temperature until the BPB dye reaches the bottom of the separating gel. With a mini- slab gel (1 mm thick, 9 cm wide, and 9 cm long), the
time required for complete electrophoresis is about 1.5 h for the Bis–Tris–HCl gel buffer system and 2 h for the Tris–AcOH system. For the Tris–AcOH system containing agarose, run the gels under constant-current conditions of 15 mA/gel at room temperature until the BPB dye reaches the bottom of the sepa-rating gel. The time required for complete electrophoresis is about 4 h when the mini-slab gel is used ( see   Note 30  ).             1.    When the electrophoresis run is complete, remove the gel from the apparatus and ﬁ  x it using the ﬁ  x solution.      2.    The ﬁ  xed gel is incubated in a CBB stain solution to visualize the protein bands.      3.    The stained gel is washed in the washing solution until the background is clear.              1.    When the run is complete, remove the gel from the apparatus and soak it in the blotting buffer containing 1 mM EDTA for 30 min ( see   Note 31  ).      2.    Soak the gel in the blotting buffer without EDTA for a further
10–30 min.      3.    Prepare the poly(vinylidene diﬂ  uoride) (PVDF) membrane (e.g., Fluorotrans W, Nippon Pall, Tokyo, Japan) by cutting it to the same size as the gel and soak it for 30 s in 100 % MeOH. Then, incubate the membrane in the blotting buffer for more than 30 min.      4.    Prepare four pieces of blotting paper (e.g., 3MM; Whatman, Maidstone, UK) by cutting them to the same size as the gel.      5.    To form a “blotting sandwich” on the electroblotting screen attached to the electroblotting equipment, assemble the gel, PVDF membrane, and 3MM paper as follows. Soak the blot-ting sponge attached to the electroblotting equipment in the blotting buffer and place it on the electroblotting screen. Then soak two pieces of 3MM paper in the blotting buffer and place them on the sponge; these are followed sequentially by the gel and PVDF membrane. Avoid incorporating air between the various layers. Then place two more sheets of 3MM paper and 3.2.2  Procedure

340one sponge soaked in the blotting buffer on the membrane and close the electroblotting screen. Insert the electroblotting screen into the chamber unit of the electroblotting equipment and ﬁ  ll up with the blotting buffer ( see   Note 32  ).      6.    Gently add SDS solution to the blotting buffer of the chamber unit to a ﬁ  nal concentration of 0.1 % (w/v) ( see   Note 33  ).      7.    Attach the leads to the power supply. When you are using gel buffer systems without agarose, run the gel under constant- voltage conditions. With a Nippon Eido model NA-1511C electroblotting wet-tank unit, a constant-voltage of 30 V (4 V/cm) for 16 h (overnight) without cooling is optimal. When an electroblotting unit with a cooling system is used, the equip-ment can be operated at higher voltages (20–22 V/cm) for 1 h. For the Tris–AcOH system with agarose, run the gel under constant-voltage conditions of 3.5 V/cm for 16 h (overnight)
( see   Note 34  ) (for troubleshooting advice,  see  Table  1 ).      8.    After blotting, soak the PVDF membrane in TBS-T solution, and then perform the immunoblotting analysis (for trouble-shooting advice,  see  Table  1 ).         The current Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE produced better separa-tions of phosphorylated species of various proteins than did the previous Mn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE. Comparative studies were performed by using several molecular-weight markers (14–97 kDa) and four standard phosphoproteins: β-casein (24 kDa), α-casein (24 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), and pepsin (35 kDa) (Fig.  3 ).

By using the Zn 2+ –Phos-tag gel buffered with Bis–Tris–HCl, three distinct phosphorylated species of ovalbumin could be separated, as indicated by  arrowheads   ( see  lane 8 in part ( b ); from the  top : species phosphorylated at both Ser-68 and Ser-344, species monophosphorylated at Ser-68, and species monophosphorylated at Ser- 344, respectively) [ 47 ]        Emiko Kinoshita-Kikuta et al.

342were examined for Zn 2+ –Phos-tag gels buffered with Tris–AcOH (Fig.  3a ) or with Bis–Tris–HCl (Fig.  3b ) and for Mn 2+ –Phos-tag gel (Fig.  3c ). In normal SDS-PAGE gels (left-hand panels; no Phos-tag), no signiﬁ  cant difference was observed in the electro-phoresis banding images of any of the samples in the three buffer systems under our experimental conditions. The Phos-tag gels (right-hand panels, 100 μM) were prepared to contain identical concentrations of polyacrylamide to that present in the corre-sponding normal gel. In all the Phos-tag gels, phosphorylated β-casein, α-casein, and ovalbumin migrated less than did their completely dephosphorylated counterparts. The partially dephos-phorylated β-casein (lane 2) and α-casein (lane 5) produced mul-tiple bands. The banding images of β-casein and α-casein were similar for all three buffer systems, whereas some differences were observed in the banding image of ovalbumin, where three distinct
up-shifted bands were clearly detectable in the Zn 2+ –Phos-tag gel buffered with Bis–Tris–HCl ( see  arrowheads in lane 8 of Fig.  3b ). Furthermore, under our experimental conditions, the migrated positions of ovalbumin (45 kDa) and BSA (66 kDa) in the molecular- weight markers (lane 7) were inverted on the Zn 2+ –Phos-tag gel buffered with Bis–Tris–HCl. We did not observe this inversion on the Zn 2+ –Phos-tag gel buffered with Tris–AcOH or Mn 2+ –Phos-tag gel, even at lower concentrations of polyacryl-amide. In the banding image of pepsin, a shift in the mobility of the phosphorylated species (lane 10) compared with that of its dephosphorylated counterpart (lane 11) was detectable in the both Zn 2+ –Phos-tag gels, but not in the Mn 2+ –Phos-tag gel.     The Tris–AcOH buffer system in Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE had some advantages in permitting the casting of highly porous poly-acrylamide gels containing less than 4 % (w/v) of polyacrylamide
for the separation and analysis of large phosphoproteins with molecular masses of more than 200 kDa. We demonstrated the detection of a novel phosphorylated form of ATM (350 kDa) by using this system. ATM is a DNA damage signaling-related protein that becomes autophosphorylated at its Ser-367, Ser-1893, and Ser-1981 residues in response to DNA damage, and subsequently initiates kinase activity toward other molecules [ 49 ]. Recently, autophosphorylation at Ser-2996 has also been reported [ 50 ]. The various phosphorylation states of ATM therefore form key compo-nents of the signaling pathway. A set of lysates was prepared from HeLa cells after treating the cells (10 7  cells) with 0 μM (control) or 2 μM actinomycin D (as a DNA-damaging reagent) for 2 h. The induced culture and the control culture were each washed twice with a TBS solution and then lysed in 0.50 mL of a 1× sample- loading dye. The two lysates were ﬁ  rst analyzed by Zn 2+ –Phos-tag
SDS-PAGE on a 3.0 % (w/v) polyacrylamide gel strengthened with 0.5 % (w/v) agarose containing 20 μM of polyacrylamide- bound 3.5.2  Separation and Detection of a High-Molecular- Mass Phosphorylated ATM [ 45 ]Emiko Kinoshita-Kikuta et al.
343Zn 2+ –Phos-tag in conjunction with the Tris–AcOH buffer system (Fig.  4a , left-hand panel). Subsequent immunoblotting with a phosphorylation-independent anti-ATM antibody produced a sin-gle band in the case of the control sample (left lane: −) and three additional up-shifted bands in the case of the treated sample (right lane: +). Next, the two lysates were analyzed by using the older Mn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE method with the same concentration of agarose–polyacrylamide composite gel containing 20 μM of polyacrylamide-bound Mn 2+ –Phos-tag in conjunction with Laemmli’s buffer system (Fig.  4a , right-hand panel). Only two up- shifted bands corresponding to phosphorylated forms of ATM were detected in this case. Therefore, the current Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE protocol using the Tris–AcOH buffer (pH 7.0) per-mits a more-detailed detection of shifts in the mobility of phos-phorylated species of ATM in response to DNA damage than does
the previous Mn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE. In a similar separation analysis using the Bis–Tris–HCl system, we obtained smeared elec-trophoresis signals as a result of the inadequate sieving property of the dilute acrylamide gels (Fig.  4b ), as mentioned in Subheading  1.5 .     In an analysis of EGF-dependent phosphor ylation of ERK1 (44 kDa) and ERK2 (42 kDa), we demonstrated the presence of differences in the distribution proﬁ  ling of phosphorylated congeners of ERK1 and ERK2 between the two neutral buffer systems. Whole lysates of untreated A431 cells (10 7  cells) and EGF-treated A431 cells (250 ng/mL, 5 min) were subjected to Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE in the presence of Bis–Tris–HCl or Tris–AcOH buffer, followed by immunoblotting analysis using a phosphorylation- independent anti-ERK1/2 antibody. Three distinct up-shifted bands were detected in the samples of EGF-treated cell lysate on both types of 1-D Phos-tag gel (Fig.  5a ). 2-DE coupling with normal Laemmli’s
SDS-PAGE as the ﬁ  rst dimension revealed that each up-shifted band detected on the 1-D gels contained two variants each of ERK1 and ERK2.   Next, we examined the time-course of changes in the EGF- induced phosphorylation levels of ERK1 and ERK2 by using Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE with Bis–Tris–HCl or Tris–AcOH buffer. The gels were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-phospho- site-speciﬁ  c antibody against both pT 202  and pY 204  (anti-pT 202 /Y 204  antibody). Subsequently, the same blots were probed again with the phosphorylation-independent anti-ERK antibody (total ERK, Fig.  5b ). In the Bis–Tris–HCl buffer system (upper panels), the top band showed a cross activity with the anti-pT 202 /Y 204  antibody , indi-cating that this band corresponds to an active form of ERK. The level of the active form of ERK1/2 increased during 2–10 min and then decreased for 30 min. The second band from the top appeared after
2 min and then slowly disappeared during 120 min. The third band showed similar dynamics of phosphorylation to active ERK1/2. 3.5.3  Comparison of the Mobilities of Phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the Two Neutral-pH Gel Systems [ 45 ]Neutral Phos-Tag SDS-PAGE System

The Tris–AcOH gel buffer and Tris–Tricine running buffer were used in Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE ( left panel  ), and Laemmli’s gel buffer and running buffer were used in Mn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE ( right panel  ). Each lane contained 10 μg proteins. ( b ) A typical electrophoresis image using a Bis–Tris-buffered gel at a concentration of 4 % (w/v) of polyacrylamide in Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE.

345In the Tris–AcOH buffer system (lower panels), on the other hand, the second band from the top showed a cross activity with the anti-pT 202 /Y 204  antibody, indicating that the band corresponds to active forms of ERK1/2. From the time-dependent dynamics of phos-phorylation of each band, we deduced that the top band and third band in the Tris–AcOH system were equivalent to the second and third bands, respectively, in the Bis–Tris–HCl system. Thus, a dif-ference in the distribution proﬁ  ling of phosphorylated species of ERK1/2 between the two systems was demonstrated. The differ-ent results obtained with the two buffer systems suggest that the afﬁ nity of Zn 2+ –Phos-tag to phosphoproteins might be affected not only by the pH of the gel, but also by other factors, such as the nature of the gel buffer or the presence of leading or trailing ions during electrophoresis.  The two up-shifted bands other than the active form were
identiﬁ  ed as monophosphorylated species by immunoblotting with two anti-phospho-site-speciﬁ  c antibodies against pT 202  and pY 204 , respectively. The third band that was detected in both buffer sys-tems corresponds to a species that was monophosphorylated at the Thr-202 residue, and the others correspond to the species mono-phosphorylated at the Tyr-204 residue (Fig.  5c , left and center panels in both buffer systems). Because MEK is a kinase with a dual speciﬁ  city that simultaneously phosphorylates the Thr-202 and Tyr-204 residues of ERK in a processive manner [ 51 ], we hypoth-esized that the monophosphorylated species might be generated during dephosphorylation by certain activities of protein phospha-tase toward ERK1/2. Several protein phosphatases, including Tyr- speciﬁ  c, Ser/Thr-speciﬁ  c, and dual-speciﬁ  c phosphatases, have been reported to act as ERK phosphatases [ 52 ]. We therefore ana-lyzed the EGF-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in A431
cells in the presence of a Ser/Thr-speciﬁ  c phosphatase inhibitor (calyculin A) or a Tyr-speciﬁ  c phosphatase inhibitor (pervanadate) (Fig.  5c , right-hand panels in both buffer systems). In the sample of the lysate of the EGF-stimulated cells (250 ng/mL, 5 min) pretr eated with calyculin A (100 nM, 30 min), the active form (a diphos-phorylated species) and a species that was monophosphorylated at Thr-202 were observed in both buffer systems. In the sample of Fig. 4  (continued) The separated sample lane was cut, and then the part corre-sponding to 80–250 kDa was subjected to Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE [4 % (w/v) polyacryl amide, 50 μM Zn 2+ –Phos-tag] buffered with Bis–Tris–HCl as the sec-ond dimension. The Phos-tag gel was strengthened with 0.5 % (w/v) SeaKem Gold agarose. All the spots appeared as smeared images after gel staining, because the Bis–Tris-buffered gel did not have adequate sieving properties at
concentration of less than 4 % (w/v) polyacrylamide. The  R   f   value of 1.0 is deﬁ  ned as the position of the BPB dye. Figures are reproduced from ref. [ 45 ] with permission of the publisher       Neutral Phos-Tag SDS-PAGE System
Fig. 5    Comparison of mobility of phosphorylated ERK between the Bis–Tris–HCl buffer system and Tris–AcOH buffer system. ( a ) A431 whole lysate (−, 10 μg proteins) and lysate from EGF-stimulated cells (+, 10 μg pro-teins) were subjected to Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE [8.0 % (w/v) polyacrylamide and 25 μM Zn 2+ –Phos-tag] using the Bis–Tris–HCl buffer system or Tris–AcOH buffer system. The gels were analyzed by Western blotting with
347lysate from cells pretreated with pervanadate (1.0 mM, 30 min), on the other hand, the active form and a species that was mono-phosphorylated at Tyr-204 were observed. When the cells were stimulated with EGF in the presence of the MEK-speciﬁ  c inhibitor PD98059 (100 μM, 60 min), no phosphorylated species were detected. These results show that the three up-shifted bands observed in both buffer systems are MEK-dependent phosphory-lated species in the EGF-signaling pathway; one is the active form diphosphorylated at both Thr-202 and Tyr-204 residues by MEK, and the others are partially dephosphorylated forms produced  during inactivation by certain ERK phosphatases. Therefore, we found that our two buffer systems could be used to obtain an over-view of the kinase/phosphatase-dependent dynamics of various phosphorylation states of ERK1/2 in the EGF-signaling pathway.    4    Notes      1.

Fig. 5  (continued) a phosphorylation-independent anti-ERK antibody (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The lysate from the EGF- stimulated cells (10 μg proteins) was analyzed by 2-DE, consisting of normal SDS-PAGE [8.0 % (w/v) polyacrylamide] as the ﬁ  rst dimension and Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE [8.0 % (w/v) polyacrylamide, 25 μM Zn 2+ –Phos-tag] as the second dimension. The  R   f   value of 1.0 is deﬁ  ned as the position of the BPB dye. ( b ) The time-course of phosphorylation of ERK after stimulation with EGF (250 ng/mL) was analyzed by Zn 2+ –Phos-tag
SDS-PAGE [8.0 % (w/v) polyacrylamide and 25 μM Zn 2+ –Phos-tag] using the Bis–Tris–HCl buffer system or the Tris–AcOH buffer system. Each lane contains 10 μg of proteins. The gels were analyzed by Western blotting with the dual-phosphorylation-speciﬁ  c anti-pT 202 /Y 204  antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), and then the same blot was reprobed with the phosphorylation-independent anti-ERK antibody. ( c ) A431 whole lysate (control, 10 μg proteins) and lysate from EGF-stimulated cells (10 μg proteins, 250 ng/mL of EGF for 5 min) were subjected to Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE [8.0 % (w/v) polyacrylamide and 25 μM Zn 2+ –Phos-tag] using the Bis–Tris–HCl buffer system or Tris–AcOH buffer system, followed by immunoblotting with the phospho- site-speciﬁ  c anti-pT 202  antibody or anti-pY 204  antibody ( left  and  center panels  , respectively, in both systems) (Signalway Antibody, Pearland, TX, USA). Lysates from EGF-stimulated cells (10 μg proteins, 250 ng/
mL of EGF for 5 min) pretreated with calyculin A (100 nM, 30 min) (Cell Signaling Technology), pervanadate [a mixture of 1.0 mM sodium orthovanadate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 3.0 mM H 2 O 2  (Nacalai Tesque), 30 min], or PD98059 (100 μM, 60 min) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA, USA) were similarly analyzed with the phosphorylation- independent anti-ERK antibody ( right panels   in the both systems).

348   3.    2-Sulfanylethanol is toxic by inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact. When handling this chemical, work in a chemical fume hood, wear gloves and a mask, and use a pipetting aid. If prepared without 2-sulfanylethanol, the buffer solution can be stored at room temperature. In this case, 2-sulfanylethanol should be dissolved in the solution to a concentration of 15 % (v/v) immediately before use.      4.    The oily product, acrylamide-pendent Phos-tag ligand (10 mg), is placed in a plastic tube and completely dissolved in MeOH (0.10 mL). The solution is diluted with distilled water (3.2 mL) by pipetting. MeOH is an inhalation toxin that causes depression of the central nervous system; when han-dling this chemical, work in a chemical fume hood, wear gloves, and use a pipetting aid. The Phos-tag solution is stable for at least 6 months.      5.    Do not use any other salts such as Mn(NO 3 ) 2  or Mn(OAc) 2 . The solution of MnCl 2  is stable for at least 6 months.
6.    Because acrylamide monomer is a neurotoxin and a suspected human carcinogen and teratogen, take care to avoid exposure to this substance. When weighing powdered acrylamide, work in a chemical fume hood and wear gloves, eye protection, and a mask. Furthermore, acrylamide is unstable and can polymer-ize violently on heating to its melting point (84.5 °C). It is incompatible with acids, bases, oxidizing agents, reducing agents, iron and its salts, copper, aluminum, brass, and free- radical initiators.      7.    Avoid skin and eye contact, ingestion, and inhalation. Prolonged exposure may result in skin burns and ulcerations. Inhalation can cause respiratory irritation. The APS solution should be prepared immediately before use.      8.    TEMED is stored in a desiccator at room temperature. Buy
small bottles as its quality may degrade once the container is opened, resulting in gels taking longer to polymerize. So after opening it, use it up as soon as possible. The commercially available solution is used as received.      9.    Do not adjust the pH with acid or base.      10.    Zinc(II) nitrate solution [10 mM Zn(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O (e.g., Nacalai Tesque, catalogue number 36932-32) in distilled water] is a suitable substitute. Because ZnCl 2  and Zn(NO 3 ) 2  are deliquescent salts, the solutions should be prepared by using fresh products from newly opened bottles. Aqueous solutions of ZnCl 2  or Zn(NO 3 ) 2  are stable for at least 6 months.      11.    This buffer is used for the separating and stacking gels.      12.    Do not adjust the pH with acid or base.      13.    Sulﬁ te ion (SO 3  2− ) is a reducing reagent that decreases O 2  levels in the electrophoresis running buffer solution and inhibits the Emiko Kinoshita-Kikuta et al.
349oxidation of reduced proteins in the gel. Buffer solution in which sodium bisulﬁ  te has been dissolved should be promptly used for electrophoresis. Do not store buffer solution contain-ing sodium bisulﬁ  te.      14.    This buffer is used for the separating and stacking gels.      15.    Acetic acid (AcOH) is dangerously irritating to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. When handing this chemical, work in a chemical fume hood and wear gloves, eye protection, and a mask. Keep away from heat and ﬂ  ame.      16.    When analyzing for high-molecular-mass phosphoproteins, agarose can optionally be used. We have conﬁ  rmed in the Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE methodology that some commer-cially available agaroses with a gel strength of more than 1,000 g/cm 2  at 1.5 % (w/v) {e.g., Agarose LO3 TAKARA [>2,200 g/cm 2  at 1.5 % (w/v)] purchased from Takara Bio, Agarose KANTO [900–1,400 g/cm 2  at 1.5 % (w/v)] pur-chased from Kanto Chemical, Agarose KANTO ME [1,400–
1,700 g/cm 2  at 1.5 % (w/v)] purchased from Kanto Chemical, or Agarose KANTO LE [1,200–1,500 g/cm 2  at 1.5 % (w/v)] purchased from Kanto Chemical} are all suitable substitutes for SeaKem Gold agarose with a gel strength of >3,500 g/cm 2  at 1.5 % (w/v). However, NuSieve GTG [>500 g/cm 2  at 4 % (w/v)] from Lonza is not suitable as a substitute for addition to Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE gel buffered with Tris–AcOH to a ﬁ nal concentration of 0.5 % (w/v). NuSieve 3:1 [>1,400 g/cm 2  at 4 % (w/v)] from Lonza, when added to the SDS-PAGE gel to a ﬁ  nal concentration of 0.5 % (w/v), does not produce sufﬁ ciently strong gels for subsequent handling during electroblotting.      17.    Do not adjust the pH with acid or base.      18.    Although the semi-dry method is generally the most efﬁ  cient method for protein blotting in terms of time and consumption of buffer reagents, it is not suitable for electroblotting from the
Phos-tag SDS-PAGE gel. The transfer efﬁ  ciency of proteins is lower in the semi-dry method than that in the wet-tank method. Do not adjust the pH with acid or base.      19.    During adjustment of the pH with NaOH, EDTA dissolves in the distilled water. NaOH is dangerously irritating to the skin and eyes. When handing this chemical, wear gloves and eye protection.      20.    Except for the buffer system, the procedure for Mn 2+ –Phos- tag SDS-PAGE is almost identical. For details of the procedure,  see  ref. [ 38 ]. The procedure of gel preparation from  step 1   to  step 16   in Subheading  3.2.1   requires 1 h.      21.    Because the optimal percentage of polyacrylamide [e.g., 5–15 % (w/v)] depends on the molecular weight of the target Neutral Phos-Tag SDS-PAGE System
350protein, an appropriate value should be determined for each target. In Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE, the  R   f   values of both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated proteins are generally smaller than are those in normal SDS-PAGE. The optimal con-centration of Zn 2+ –Phos-tag (e.g., 5–150 μM) to achieve suf-ﬁ cient separation between the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated proteins should be determined. It is rec-ommended that, in the procedure using the mini-slab gel, tests should be conducted by using low concentrations of Zn 2+ –Phos-tag (5–25 μM) for complex samples that contain various phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated proteins, such as cell lysates.      22.    After  step 5  , the polymerized separating gel should be allowed to stand at room temperature for 16 h (overnight). It is neces-sary to introduce the layer of 50 % (v/v) aqueous propan-2-ol solution on top of the polymerized separating gel to prevent the gel from drying out.
the gel from drying out.      23.    After  step 9  , Zn 2+ –Phos-tag gels cast in Bis–Tris–HCl or Tris–AcOH neutral buffer will be stable for at least 6 months. However, the gel, casting glass plates, and sample-well comb should be wrapped in Saran wrap to prevent drying out of the gel. It is possible to store the wrapped gel at room temperature under normal laboratory illumination until required. Recently, precast Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE gels have become commer-cially available (SuperSep Phos-tag; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) [ 53 ].      24.    The optimal concentration (w/v) of polyacrylamide (e.g., 2.5–4.0 %) depends on the molecular weight of the target protein. Refer to Fig.  2 , which shows typical examples of the  relationships between the degree of migration ( R   f   value) and the molecular weight of two proteins, myosin heavy chain (205 kDa) and ATM (350 kDa), in 2.5–4.0 % (w/v) polyacrylamide mini-slab
gels containing 0.5 % (w/v) agarose buffered with Tris–AcOH without Zn 2+ –Phos-tag. The optimal concentration of Zn 2+ –Phos-tag (e.g., 5–100 μM) to achieve sufﬁ  cient separation between the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated proteins should be determined as described in  step 3   ( see   Note 21  ). It is also recommended that when agarose–polyacrylamide com-posite mini-slab gels are used with complex samples of lysate, tests should be conducted using low concentrations of Zn 2+ –Phos-tag (5–25 μM).      25.    To prevent changes in the concentration of the agarose solu-tion as a result of boiling and evaporative loss of water, any volume lost after complete melting of the agarose solution should be made up with distilled water.      26.    Agarose–polyacrylamide composite gel cast in Tris–AcOH neutral buffer are also stable for at least 6 months after  step 16  . Emiko Kinoshita-Kikuta et al.
351The gel can be stored until required by adopting the procedure described above in  Note 23  .      27.    The procedure of electrophoresis from  step 1   to  step 3   in Subheading  3.2.2   requires 1.5–4 h.      28.    If any bubbles are observed, they should be carefully and com-pletely removed.      29.    Various contaminants (e.g., EDTA, inorganic salts, or surfac-tants) in the sample protein solutions can cause disruption (waving and/or tailing) of the electrophoresis bands in Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE. To minimize this disruption, it is rec-ommended that the samples should be desalted before loading if there are large differences in the concentrations of contaminants in the various samples. Furthermore, to avoid distortion of protein bands, do not use commercially avail-able prestained molecular-weight protein markers in Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE.      30.    Agarose-containing gels frequently display partial melting dur-
ing electrophoresis because of the development of heat. To avoid this problem with the agarose–polyacrylamide compos-ite gel, it is necessary to use conditions of a relatively lower constant voltage (15 mA/gel) for a longer time of about 4 h in the procedure for the Tris–AcOH system.      31.    The presence of Zn 2+ –Phos-tag in the gel causes inefﬁ  cient electroblotting. This can be ameliorated by treatment with EDTA, which chelates the zinc(II) ions.      32.    The use of wet-tank equipment is strongly recommended for optimal efﬁ  ciency of protein transfer from the Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE gel. The efﬁ  ciency of transfer of proteins from the Zn 2+ –Phos-tag gel is much higher in the wet-tank method than in the semi-dry method.      33.    The addition of SDS is recommended for optimal efﬁ  ciency of protein transfer from the Zn 2+ –Phos-tag SDS-PAGE gel. The optimal percentage of SDS [e.g., 0.05–0.2 % (w/v)] to achieve
adequate electrotransfer should be determined.      34.    Do not set the voltage above 3.5 V/cm for the Tris–AcOH system with agarose. Higher voltages during this step are not recommended, even if an electroblotting unit with a cooling apparatus is used.

Scott     and     Stuart     J.     Cordwell        Abstract    Large-scale analysis of protein  N - and  O -linked glycosylation by mass spectrometry has traditionally been performed in eukaryotes by parallel approaches aimed at elucidating glycan structures (glycomics) and their formerly glycosylated peptides (glycoproteomics) without reference to their intact state. Such analy-ses depend heavily on commercial glycosidases (e.g. protein  N -glycosidase F) that can remove glycans from the peptide backbone for separate analyses. Bacterial glycosylation has only recently been identiﬁ  ed
as a widespread phenomenon. In many cases however, unique bacterial sugars preclude enzymatic removal, therefore ultimately requiring a site-speciﬁ  c approach for intact glycopeptide analysis. Here, we describe protocols for the enrichment of bacterial glycopeptides using zwitterionic–hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (ZIC-HILIC) and their analysis using liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with collision-induced dissociation (CID) and higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation for glycan structure elucidation and glycopeptide identiﬁ  cation.

[ 1 ,  2 ]. Although the functional context for bacterial glycosylation is largely unknown, there is mounting evidence that glycosylation is required for wild-type levels of ﬁ  tness and deletion of genes encod-ing glycan biosynthesis enzymes or glycosyltransferases (GTases) results in marked changes in virulence and host colonization [ 3 – 6 ]. There is thus a substantial need to identify the protein targets of glycosylation, and hence a requirement for robust methods that enable qualitative and quantitative analyses of glycosylated sub-strates and site localization, as well as the  determination of glycan structures and/or composition. In eukaryotes, such approaches 1.1  Protein Glycosylation in Bacteria
356generally rely on methods to chemically or enzymatically isolate glycans from their attachment site, allowing parallel, yet indepen-dent, analysis of the “glycome” and “glycoproteome” [ 7 ,  8 ]. Such approaches are however, generally incompatible with prokaryotic glycosylation due to the inherent diversity of bacterial glycans, which predominantly utilize a varied repertoire of unique monosac-charides, either as sole modiﬁ  cations or as part of more complex polysaccharides [ 1 ,  2 ]. Additionally, in many cases these unique monosaccharides inhibit typical analytical approaches (e.g. the asparagine-linked bacillosamine in the  Campylobacter jejuni N -linked glycan is resistant to cleavage by protein N-glycosidase F [PNGase F]).   Over the last decade there have been a number of newly charac-terized general glycosylation systems identiﬁ  ed in a wide range of bacterial species [ 1 ,  2 ,  5 ,  6 ,  9 ,  10 ], which have facilitated the
elucidation of glycan structures and their protein targets. Glycosylation should not be regarded as a single discrete modiﬁ  -cation but rather as a class of several possible types, broadly clus-tered into  N - and  O -linkages (although rarer linkages such as  C -mannosylation also occur), that can occur in both gram-nega-tive and -positive organisms and are characterized by the enzy-matic formation of a chemical linkage between a carbohydrate chain or monomer and protein substrates by the actions of oligo-saccharyltransferases (OSTases) or GTases. Addition of glycans to protein can also be via en bloc or sequential transfer. For en bloc transfer, the glycan is typically assembled on a membrane-bound lipid carrier (e.g. the  C. jejuni N  -linked and  Neisseria meningiti-dis O  -linked systems) and added upon completion to synthesized proteins within the periplasmic space; while sequential transfer implies the addition of a single sugar to protein potentially fol-
lowed by additional monosaccharides (e.g.  Haemophilus inﬂ  uen-zae  high molecular weight adhesin 1 (HMW1) glycosylation and  C. jejuni   ﬂ agellin glycosylation [ 11 ,  12 ]).  The OSTases and GTases, which appear to be present across bacterial genera, typically target protein substrates at similar con-sensus motifs (e.g. the D/E-X-N-X-S/T [X ≠ Pro] of  N -linked glycosylation in  C. jejuni  ), or in disordered protein regions (e.g. the low complexity or repeat regions targeted by ligase-like  O -linked systems). Glycosylation events can involve the attach-ment of multiple carbohydrates, ranging from single hexose or  N -acetylhexosamine sugars or bacterial-speciﬁ  c carbohydrates such as pseudaminic acid or other nonulosonic acid derivatives [ 2 ,  11 ,  13 ], to complex glycan structures [ 2 ,  5 ,  6 ,  10 ]. Further complexity is generated by the addition of non-carbohydrate moieties such as
methylated aspartic acid, phosphate, and phosphoethanolamine 1.1.1  Diversity of Bacterial Glycans and Glycosylation SystemsNichollas E. Scott and Stuart J. Cordwell
357(pEtN) to multiple glycan structures [ 14 ,  15 ]. Finally,  glycosylation site occupation may also be more complex than initially thought, with increasing evidence of glycan micro-heterogeneity, leading to the same site being occupied by multiple unique glycans, as well as site-speciﬁ  c competition with other modiﬁ  cations such as direct protein pEtN or phosphocholine (pCh) addition [ 16 ].    Methods to detect glycosylation events in prokaryotes are limited and generally rely on prior knowledge of the glycan composition (and hence known mass). Initial exploratory approaches included glycan staining, lectin blotting or afﬁ  nity puriﬁ  cation [ 17 ], and targeting using substrate probes combined with gel-based separa-tions and identiﬁ  cation by mass spectrometry (MS). Such approaches are generally clouded by false positives (e.g. non- glycosylated co-purifying proteins in lectin afﬁ  nity puriﬁ  cations)
and the reliance on gel technologies overlooks glycosylated pro-teins that are hydrophobic or contain multiple transmembrane regions, as well as high molecular mass proteins. For optimal glycoprotein identiﬁ  cation and site elucidation, a high-through-put strategy compatible with complex mixtures and gel-free separation was developed [ 18 ]. Here, we describe the use of zwitterionic–hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (ZIC-HILIC) for the enrichment of bacterial glycopeptides based on their hydrophilicity and coupled to the use of liquid chroma-tography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) by collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation for the conﬁ  rmation of glycan structure and higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation for elucidation of glycopeptide sequence. From our experience, larger glycans allow more efﬁ  cient enrichment, with the  N -linked glycans of  Campylobacter   species [ 14 ,  18 ] and mul-
timers of  Acinetobacter   species [ 19 ] easily enriched from ~100 μg of peptide material. Despite this, smaller glycans can also be effec-tively enriched by this approach (e.g. trisaccharides from  Burkholderia cepacia   [ 6 ]). It should be noted that in addition to trypsin other proteases can be used to generate different glyco-peptide mixtures and thus enable greater coverage of the glyco-proteome [ 18 ]. The use of multiple MS/MS fragmentation approaches within a single LC-MS/MS analysis also provides a streamlined analysis of glycosylated substrates (Orbitrap/Tribrid instruments are thus an ideal platform for these analyses). As with other proteomic approaches, this technique when coupled with labeling techniques such as dimethylation, SILAC or iTRAQ, also enables quantitative analysis of bacterial glycosylation. The devel-opment of this robust and selective approach to identify glycopro-teins has been essential in expanding our understanding of
glycosylation within several bacterial species.    1.1.2  Proteomic Approaches to Bacterial Glycoprotein Identiﬁ  cationMS Identiﬁ  cation of Bacterial Glycopeptides

Operate the mass spectrometer (e.g. LTQ Orbitrap Velos/Elite or Fusion) in data-dependent acquisition mode, automat-

Acquire the full-scan MS scan in the Orbital trap at a resolution of  R  = 60,000 (at 400  m / z ) between 350 and 1,800  m / z  ( see   Note 14  ).

Export MS/MS scan events that do not result in peptide iden-tiﬁ cation to Microsoft Excel.      5.    Use the “mgf graph” module in GPMAW 8.2 to identify pos-sible glycopeptides in this list that contain the diagnostic oxo-nium 204.086  m / z  ion ( see   Note 17  ).      6.    Manually inspect the CID and HCD scan events of each poten-tial glycopeptide using Xcalibur to conﬁ  rm that these scans of the same peptide are dissimilar (Fig.  2b, c  ).      7.    For HCD scan events, the deglycosylated peptide and the pep-tide plus one carbohydrate are typically the most abundant ions and can be used to determine a putative deglycosylated mass of the glycopeptide (Fig.  2d ).      8.    To facilitate a glycopeptide assignment from an HCD scan, ions below the mass of the predicted deglycosylated peptide
are extracted within Xcalibur using the Spectrum List function. Ions with a deconvoluted mass above that of the deglycosyl-ated peptide and those corresponding to known carbohydrate oxonium ions are removed and the resulting peak list used to generate a .mgf ﬁ  le that can be searched with MASCOT, using the same parameters deﬁ  ned for the initial search ( step 3  ).      9.    To further validate glycopeptide matches, HCD scan events are annotated using the Expert Annotation tool (Fig.  2e ).       4    Notes      1.

An alterative method for the construction of ZIC-HILIC col-umns using constricted GELoader tips in place of C 8  support has also been reported, for instructions  see  [ 22 ].
4.    Alterative ion pairing agents can be used and have been shown to augment the efﬁ  ciency of HILIC enrichment [ 23 ]. With certain samples these agents can be more effective than FA and should be considered during optimization.

For complete assignment of glycopeptides (absolute site local-ization independent of any sequence motif constraints), CID, HCD and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) approaches can be used provided the instrumentation supports these fragmen-tation techniques. Alternatively, if only the peptide sequence and conﬁ  rmation of glycosylation are required, beam-type fragmentation on Q-Tof or Q-Exactive instrumentation may be used.      6.    An alterative to Benzonase ®  nuclease is Cryonase (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Takara Bio Group), which provides enhanced nuclease digestion at 4 °C.      7.    Ensure the sample remains chilled during sonication and is at 4 °C before beginning another round of sonication.      8.    With each round of sonication the amount of extracted protein should decrease, for most gram-negative bacteria we have examined 5 rounds results in effective solubilization of mem-brane material.
brane material.      9.    Alternative enzymes may also be useful for generation of gly-copeptides of suitable length conducive to their analysis (e.g. GluC, AspN). Importantly, due to the steric hindrance provided by larger glycans, non-speciﬁ  c proteinases such as thermolysin, pepsin and proteinase-K can also be used to generate peptides of adequate length to enable glycopeptide identiﬁ  cation [ 24 ]. If these enzymes are used, the corre-sponding digestion buffer may also require alteration to ensure maximum efﬁ  ciency.      10.    The presence of salts and urea/thiourea severely compromises the enrichment of glycopeptides using ZIC-HILIC. For opti-mal results ensure the effective clean-up of peptide samples.      11.    Do not allow the ZIC-HILIC resin to become dry during the glycopeptide enrichment process, as this appears to severely compromise the ﬁ  nal glycopeptide yield.      12.    For complex peptide lysates, 10 washes with ZIC-HILIC buf-
fer B is effective for the removal of the majority of non- glycosylated peptides, but for less complex samples such as single proteins, 3 washes are typically sufﬁ  cient. The number of wash steps should be varied to assess the effect on the enrich-ment of glycopeptides for any new sample type.      13.    A microﬂ  ow LC system can also be used but it should be noted that the use of high ﬂ  ow rates would lead to a loss of sensitivity.      14.    As the addition of a glycan increases the mass of a peptide but does not increase the observed charge state, to increase the chances of selecting a glycopeptide the lower threshold of the MS1 mass window can be increased to 500  m / z , thus 500–1,800  m / z .

367   15.    Alternative combinations of fragmentation may be used, such as ETD to gain information about the site of glycosylation. In addition to these fragmentation approaches, dynamic data- dependent methods can also be used, such as using the presence of diagnostic ions within HCD scans to trigger ETD [ 25 ,  26 ].      16.    An alterative to Proteome Discoverer for the generation of .mgf ﬁ les is MSconvert (ProteoWizard), an open source and freely avail-able software package   http:/ /proteowizard.sourceforge.net/    .      17.    As  N -acetylhexosamines are common units within glycopep-tides, the use of the diagnostic oxonium 204.086  m / z  ion is appropriate but it should be noted that some glycans might not contain  N -acetylhexosamines. In these cases, information about the glycan composition can be used to determine a more appropriate diagnostic ion.

gradient  1      Introduction  The separation of proteolytically digested samples by reversed- phase liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization (LC-MS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for proteomic analysis. This technique can detect thou-sands of individual peptides, and by referencing a database, identify their proteins of origin. Termed “bottom-up” or “shotgun” pro-teomics, this is a powerful proﬁ  ling method for proteins present in a biological sample [ 1 ]. Additional depth of coverage can be obtained by preceding LC-MS with an orthogonal upstream frac-tionation [ 2 ] generating fractions of lower complexity that are ana-lyzed separately. Orthogonal separation techniques that are used for this purpose include strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) [ 3 ], hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) [ 4 ], and iso-electric focusing (IEF) [ 5 – 8 ]. The depth of proteome coverage
obtainable with IEF can be higher than that obtained with chro-matographic methods [ 9 ,  10 ] and IEF has become widely used for this application. IEF has the additional beneﬁ  t of providing a search constraint for peptide identiﬁ  cation, since the isoelectric point (p I ) of a peptide can be predicted directly from its sequence [ 11 – 13 ]. IEF fractionation of sample digests is  predominantly performed
370using immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips due to the reproduc-ibility and versatility afforded by commercial pre- cast IPG gels cov-ering various pH ranges. The separation may either be performed in an “off-gel” mode or in an “in-gel” mode. In the “off-gel” mode, the digest is electrophoretically fractionated through a series of sample cups placed in contact with the IPG gel [ 8 ,  14 ]. The separated peptides are recovered in solution directly from the sam-ple cups. In the “in-gel” mode, the digest is loaded into an IPG gel and separated within the gel matrix [ 10 ,  12 ,  13 ,  15 – 17 ]. The sepa-rated peptides are eluted from excised sections of IPG gel. Whereas the off-gel method offers a certain degree of convenience, in-gel separations have several advantages. Peptide yields have been found to be higher and the separation is more rapid [ 18 ]. Additionally, in-gel instrumentation allows greater ﬂ  exibility in the selection of
IPG strip length and pH range. There is also no restriction with in-gel separations on the proportion of the length of IPG strip represented by each fraction. An off-gel fraction, by necessity, rep-resents a section of the gel corresponding to the footprint of a single sample cup. The pH range of an in-gel separation is deter-mined by the spacing of the cuts made. The number of fractions generated can therefore be tailored more closely to the needs of the experimenter. Since the distribution of peptide p I  is variable across the pH scale, it can be advantageous to cut the IPG strip into sections of variable length such that each eluted fraction con-tains a similar number of peptides, thereby taking fullest advantage of the downstream analysis methodology [ 19 ]. This strategy is not possible with off-gel IEF. The following method describes in-gel preparative IEF using the PROTEAN ®  i12™ IEF System, a widely
used instrument which controls voltage and current independently to each IPG strip, allowing multiple pH ranges, or samples of dif-fering conductivity to be run simultaneously.  2    Materials  Reagents and prepared buffer stocks are from Bio-Rad or Sigma- Aldrich except when indicated.

373      1.    Resuspend the peptides in 8 M urea, 0.2 % (w/v) Bio-Lyte 3-10 to a concentration of 250 μg/ml.      2.    For each separation run, pipet 200 μl of the peptide solution along the center of the channel of the i12 rehydration/ equilibration tray. Take care to not introduce air bubbles when expelling the solution ( see   Notes 7  – 10 ).      3.    Using forceps, remove the cover sheet from each IPG strip, then gently place the IPG strip gel-side down onto the solution in the channel. Move the IPG strip back and forth slightly to ensure that the solution is distributed along the length of the IPG strip. Take care to not trap air bubbles beneath the IPG strip.      4.    Overlay each IPG strip with 5 ml mineral oil. Apply the min-eral oil to both ends of the channel and allow it to ﬂ  ow toward the middle of the channel ( see   Note 11  ).      5.    Cover the tray and leave it on a level bench overnight (12–18 h) for complete rehydration.
(12–18 h) for complete rehydration.      6.    Using forceps, remove the IPG strips from the rehydration tray, remove excess mineral oil, and place the rehydrated IPG strips gel-side up in the channels of the focusing tray. Position the positive (+) ends of the IPG strips against the positioning stops in each channel.      7.    Wet the gel-side up wicks (notched) with distilled or deionized water and blot off excess water. Use two wicks per IPG strip: place a wick at each end of each IPG strip. Position the elec-trode assemblies in the focusing tray and press down on the green tabs to snap the electrode assemblies into place.      8.    Place the focusing tray with the rehydrated IPG strips on the Peltier platform and connect the electrodes to the instrument. Overlay each IPG strip with 5 ml mineral oil.      9.    Run IEF according to the following protocol: 500 V for 30 min, 1,000 V for 30 min, linear ramp to 8,000 V over 1 h,
8,000 V for 6 h. Maintain a current limit of 50 μA throughout ( see   Note 12  ).            1.    Following electrophoresis, brieﬂ  y rinse each IPG strip in a bea-ker of hexane ( see   Note 13  ).      2.    Print out a cutting template consisting of 12 parallel 1 cm lines placed 9 mm apart from one another ( see  Fig.  1 ).       3.    Place a clean sheet of glass over the template. Place each IPG strip gel-side up on the glass over the template as shown in Fig.  1 . Cut through the gel and backing over each line with a razor blade, using a fresh blade for each cut, generating twelve 9 mm gel sec-tions.

Solutions containing urea, iodoacet-amide, ammonium bicarbonate or enzyme are prepared imme-diately before use.      2.    The technique may be applied to any mammalian cell line cul-tured by any method.      3.    The basic procedure may be scaled up or down, depending on the number of IPG strips to be run.      4.    Reduction and alkylation of cysteine thiols prior to digestion and LC-MS enables more effective digestion and simpliﬁ  es MS analysis as all cysteine residues will be modiﬁ  ed with an acet-amido group. The sample is reduced with DTT and alkylated with an excess of iodoacetamide.      5.    A two-step digestion is employed utilizing Lys-C at an enzyme
to protein ratio of 1:50 followed by trypsin at an enzyme to protein ratio of 1:100. Lys-C cleaves at lysine residues and is compatible with 8 M urea and thus can be applied in undi-luted lysis solution. Trypsin cleaves at both lysine and argi-nine residues and digests optimally only when the urea concentration is 2 M or lower. The reaction is therefore diluted prior to addition of trypsin. This procedure ensures more complete digestion than trypsin alone. If desired, the digest may be directly diluted and treated with trypsin, omit-ting the Lys-C digestion step, however digestion may not be as efﬁ  cient or complete.      6.    The portion of the sample used to measure the absorbance at 280 nm should be added back to the pooled eluates following the measurement. The cuvette used for the measurement should therefore be thoroughly cleaned before use, or a dis-posable, UV transparent cuvette should be used.      7.    Handle IPG strips from the ends using forceps.

The sample is applied to the entire length of the immobilized pH gradient by rehydration into a dry IPG strip. As voltage is applied, each peptide in the sample focuses to a narrow zone in the pH gradient corresponding to its p I .      11.

Commercial small-volume solid phase extraction cartridges based on C-18-derivatized material may be used in place of the cartridges described here.      16.    The other half of each fraction (the remaining 90 μl) may be applied to another sold phase extraction cartridge if replicates are desired.      17.    Peptides are not evenly distributed across the pH gradient ( see  Fig.  2 ). This has been noted in similar studies [ 8 ,  12 ,  13 ,  16 ].       18.    In-gel fractionation was found to result in a higher number of peptide identiﬁ  cations than off-gel fractionation performed with the same pH gradient.

tribution of LC-MS peptide identiﬁ  cations from the unfrac-tionated digest and following two different IEF fractionation methods.

Gilda     and     Aldrin     V.     Gomes        Abstract    Western blotting is a commonly used laboratory technique for semi-quantifying protein amounts. It is important when quantifying protein expression to account for differences in the amount of total protein loaded onto the gel using a loading control. Common loading controls include housekeeping proteins, such as β-actin or GAPDH, quantiﬁ  ed by Western blot, or total protein, quantiﬁ  ed using a stain such as Coomassie Brilliant Blue or Ponceau S. A more recently developed method for total protein quantiﬁ  cation
utilizes stain-free technology, which has a linear dynamic detection range and allows for protein detection on both gels and membranes. Here, we describe the theory and use of stain-free gels for total protein quantiﬁ  cation and normalization of Western blots.    Key words     Stain-free technology  ,   Western blotting  ,   Loading control  ,   Data normalization  ,   Immunoblotting  1      Introduction  Western blotting is a highly valuable laboratory technique used to quantify protein levels [ 1 ]. When carried out properly, Western blots can be used to accurately semi-quantify amounts of speciﬁ  c proteins in a complex sample; however, several considerations must be taken into account to ensure the accuracy and quality of the blot [ 2 ,  3 ]. One important consideration is the amount of protein in each lane, which may vary due to errors in protein concentration determination, loading volume, or differences in transfer efﬁ  ciency
[ 4 ]. To account for these potential differences, the amount of the target protein should be normalized to the amount of protein present in each lane using a loading control.  A commonly used loading control is the expression of a house-keeping protein, such as β-actin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), or β-tubulin, quantiﬁ  ed by Western blot. The rationale for using housekeeping proteins is that they are constitutively expressed and necessary for maintaining cell viability;
382therefore, their expression is not expected to change under  different experimental conditions. However, several publications have sug-gested that housekeeping proteins are unsatisfactory loading con-trols under certain conditions [ 5 – 7 ]. One concern with using housekeeping proteins is that they are often overloaded. The target protein and loading control must both be loaded within the linear detection range for accurate quantiﬁ  cation; however, housekeep-ing proteins are highly abundant and consequently often over-loaded, especially when a low abundance target protein is being detected, so that differences in protein amounts between lanes cannot be accurately determined [ 4 ,  6 ]. It is difﬁ  cult to determine if housekeeping proteins are overloaded for the tissue or cell of interest without generating standard curves to determine the linear range of the housekeeping protein. Additionally, the expression of
housekeeping proteins has been shown to change under various conditions, such as cell growth and differentiation, disease states, and in response to certain stimuli [ 8 – 10 ].  An alternative to housekeeping proteins as loading controls is total protein amount, which has the advantage that normalization does not depend on expression of a single protein. Total protein may be detected on the blotting membrane using stains such as Ponceau S or Coomassie blue, or the more recently developed stain-free method [ 11 ,  12 ]. In the stain-free method, the gel con-tains trihalo compounds that react with tryptophan residues. When activated by UV light, the modiﬁ  ed tryptophan residues produce ﬂ uorescence which can be quantiﬁ  ed to measure the relative amount of total protein present [ 4 ]. Quantiﬁ  cation of total protein using stain-free technology has been veriﬁ  ed as a reliable loading control and has the advantage that it gives the researcher a convenient way
to verify that protein separation and transfer were successful before proceeding with the Western blotting process [ 4 ,  5 ,  13 ,  14 ]. Here we use the stain-free method to quantify total protein in rat heart homogenates and normalize the amount of the proteasome subunit Rpt1, detected by Western blot, demonstrating that the stain-free method has a broad linear detection range, accurately reﬂ  ects the amount of protein in each lane, and serves as a reliable loading con-trol for Western blotting.  2    Materials  All solutions should be prepared with ultrapure water (18 M Ω) and analytical grade reagents. All reagents are prepared and stored at room temperature unless otherwise indicated. Sodium azide is not added to any of the solutions and all waste disposal protocols should be followed when discarding Western blotting waste. Jennifer E. Gilda and Aldrin V. Gomes

Lay the gel on top of the nitrocellulose, taking care to lay it evenly. Place the second layer of ﬁ  lter paper on top of the gel and roll air bubbles out with the roller. Place the lid on top and turn to closed. Put the cassette in the TurboBlot and run with the Turbo setting for one midi gel (the transfer will take 7 min).      2.    Remove the membrane from the cassette and image using the stain-free membrane setting with automatically optimized exposure time (Fig.  2 ). Take care to image before the mem-brane dries, as a dry membrane reduces the quality of the image. You may decide to cut the membrane into smaller sizes at this point ( see   Notes 15   and  16 ).       3.    After imaging, dry the membrane.

Place the membrane in a blotting container and rinse with water or TBST, taking care not to pour directly onto the mem-brane, as this may disrupt the protein bound to the membrane. Submerge the membrane in blocking solution so that the entire surface of the membrane is covered and incubate with shaking for 1 h. Pour off the  blocking solution  and rinse brieﬂ  y with TBST.      2.    Incubate with shaking in mouse anti-proteasome 19S Rpt1/S7 subunit primary antibody for 2 h ( see   Notes 17   and  18 ).

Pour off the secondary antibody and rinse brieﬂ  y with TBST, then rinse three times for 5 min in TBST with shaking.      4.    To image, lift the membrane with forceps, taking care to touch only the side of the membrane. Allow the TBST to drain off the membrane so that it does not dilute the ECL substrate; however, take care not to dry the membrane. The edge of the membrane may be dabbed with a Kimwipe to remove excess liquid. Place the membrane on the imaging surface, laying from one edge to the other to exclude bubbles.      5.    Combine equal parts of Clarity western peroxide reagent and Clarity western luminol/enhancer reagent. Mix the solution and pipette it onto the membrane (protein side up) so that every part of the membrane is evenly covered with ECL sub-strate ( see   Note 20  ). Either proceed directly to the imaging
step (incubation in between addition of the ECL substrate and imaging is not necessary) or incubate the ECL covered mem-brane for 2 min. If the ECL reagent is left on the membrane for 2 min, then remove the excess ECL reagent and cover the membrane with a thin sheet protector to prevent drying.      6.

To compare the band of interest to the molecular mass of the protein standard (protein ladder), take a multichannel image using the Colorimetric setting (auto-matically optimized exposure time) and Chemi Hi Sensitivity or Hi Resolution setting. This protocol will automatically overlay the chemiluminescent image with the colorimetric image, allowing you to determine the molecular weight of the band of interest.        4    Notes      1.    Unused sample buffer may be stored at −20 °C for up to 3 months or at −80 °C for more than 6 months.      2.    Any suitable pre-stained protein standard may be used; however
it should be noted that some protein standards give very strong signals when imaged using the stain-free method, likely due to a high tryptophan content of certain standards or the dye used to stain them. This may interfere with total protein quantiﬁ  cation.      3.    Do not adjust the pH with acid or base. Once diluted to a 1× buffer the pH of the buffer should be 8.3–8.6.      4.    Polyvinylidene diﬂ  uoride (PVDF) membranes may also be used with stain-free gels. We noticed that when the total pro-tein on the membrane is imaged there is a slightly higher back-ground with PVDF membranes than nitrocellulose membranes. However, if ﬂ  uorescently labeled secondary antibodies are used, low ﬂ  uorescence PVDF membranes are recommended.      5.    10× TBS can be stored at room temperature for at least 6 months (10× TBS will crystallize if stored at 4 °C).      6.    Unused BSA should be stored at 4 °C and may be used for up
to approximately 1 week after preparation. If the primary antibody is to be used again, it is recommended that freshly prepared BSA is used, as the BSA will limit the amount of time in which the antibody can be used.      7.    We have found that blocking and diluting certain antibodies with solutions of BSA in TBST gives lower background than when milk in TBST is used, though certain antibodies work better with milk. If the antibody being used gives a high level of background, the protocol may be optimized by testing the antibody with solutions of BSA and milk to see which gives lower background and stronger signal.      8.    We recommend storing a small volume of ECL substrate at room temperature for regular use, and the remainder at 4 °C for long-term storage. Using cold ECL reagent decreases the sensitivity of the blot.   Jennifer E. Gilda and Aldrin V. Gomes
389   9.    Blotting boxes of different sizes are available from Denville Scientiﬁ  c, Inc., South Plainﬁ  eld, NJ, USA. The most com-monly used blotting box size used for Criterion gels is 15.5 cm ( l ) × 10.5 cm ( w ) × 3.5 cm ( h ).      10.    Kimwipes are scientiﬁ  c cleaning wipes that are used when leaving ﬁ  bers or lint on a surface is unwanted.      11.    ImageLab imaging software is free with the ChemiDoc MP and some other Bio-Rad imagers. A convenient feature of the ImageLab software is that users are allowed an unlimited num-ber of installations on lab computers and free software upgrades from Bio-Rad.      12.    Loading signiﬁ  cantly different volumes may cause samples to run unevenly. To load a larger volume of protein ladder, the protein ladder may be diluted with 1× Laemmli sample buffer. We recommend mixing at a 1:1 ratio and loading 6 μL onto
the gel. Some of the heart homogenate was diluted to 1 mg/mL so that 10 μL could be loaded for 10 μg of total protein.      13.    For scientists that do not routinely run SDS-PAGE gels, we recommend using gel loading tips to prevent the sample from spilling into neighboring wells. Place the tip at the bottom of the well and slowly dispense the sample, raising the pipette tip toward the top of the well as the sample is dispensed. Be careful not to pipette air bubbles into the well, as it will disturb the sample.      14.    In our experience, longer activation times such as 2 or 5 min give higher intensity but do not increase the linearity of the total protein amount detected. This suggests that shorter acti-vation times only modify a portion of tryptophan residues. If the antibody being utilized detects tryptophan residues, it may therefore be advisable to use a shorter activation time so that the antibody is still able to bind to the unmodiﬁ  ed epitopes.
The gel only needs to be activated once; if the gel is imaged a second time, change activation time to None.      15.    To cut the membrane at a speciﬁ  c molecular weight to use for multiple blots, you may cut with a razor or scissors based on the molecular weight markers. You may also wish to use a Ponceau S stain as a guide to cut evenly across the width of the mem-brane. For this purpose, a short 5–10 s rinse with Ponceau S is usually sufﬁ  cient. After cutting the membrane, remove the Ponceau S stain by washing multiple times with TBST.      16.    After imaging, blots can be dried and stored at 4 °C in a zip lock bag for at least 1 week. If the membrane needs to be re-imaged after the membrane is dried, wet the membrane with TBST and image.      17.    In general, incubation of antibodies in 1 % BSA/TBST or 1 % milk/TBST gives stronger signal than antibodies in 3–5 % BSA or milk.   Stain-Free Western Blotting

If you wish to reuse the antibody, you may store it at 4 °C for up to approximately 1 week. The antibody should not be used if the BSA or milk has gone bad.      19.    The quality of the secondary antibody is important for obtain-ing a high-quality Western blot. If consistently poor results are obtained, we recommend trying a different secondary antibody.      20.    The volume of ECL substrate required to evenly cover the
membrane will depend on the area of the membrane. For an uncut midi membrane, 5–6 mL ECL substrate is sufﬁ  cient. If a clear plastic support is used to cover the membrane during imaging, a smaller volume of ECL substrate can be used, as the plastic support will spread the ECL substrate over the mem-brane. If a long exposure time (90 s or longer) is required, it is recommended to use a plastic support to prevent the mem-brane from drying during imaging. The ECL reagent should not be left on the membrane for longer than 5 min as this will result in a shorter time frame for which the maximum signal is obtained.

The presence of host cell protein (HCP) is usually assayed by ELISA using a polyclonal antibody mixture raised against a population of proteins derived from the host cell background. This antibody should recognize as high a proportion as possible of the potential HCPs in a given sample. A recom-mended method for evaluating the assay involves two-dimensional electrophoretic separation followed by Western blotting.
Western blotting.  We present here a method using commercial anti-HCP antibody and samples derived from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The 2-D electrophoresis procedure gives highly reproducible spot patterns and entire procedure can be completed in less than 2 days. Software analysis enables the straightforward generation of percent coverage values for the antibody when used to probe HCP-containing samples.

The protein is either produced in the host cell or secreted into the medium. In the case of intracellular protein production, the host cells are harvested and lysed, and the protein of interest is puriﬁ  ed from the lysate. In the case of secreted
protein, the protein of interest is puriﬁ  ed from the culture medium in which the cells have been grown. In either case, the starting material for puriﬁ  cation of the protein of interest contains other proteins from the host cell line, and these so-called host cell pro-teins (HCP) are potential impurities in the ﬁ  nal drug substance. HCP impurities can induce an immune response in the patient, so their presence needs to be minimized. Validation and quality  control testing of any therapeutic protein needs to include a test to show that HCP contamination is at a minimal level.
394 HCP contaminants can have an undesirable effect even at very low concentration and in general, the only sufﬁ  ciently sensitive assay methodology for HCP is immunochemical. The presence of HCP is usually assayed by ELISA using a polyclonal antibody mix-ture that has been developed to have reactivity against a wide range of potential HCPs. Development of the polyclonal antibody requires optimization of the number of potential targets recog-nized, and the speciﬁ  city of the assay needs to be fully validated prior to adoption [ 1 – 3 ].  A recommended method for this validation involves two- dimensional (2-D) electrophoretic separation followed by Western blotting [ 4 – 7 ]. This technique displays the proteins in a representa-tive HCP sample as an array of hundreds to thousands of individual spots. Western blotting determines which of those proteins are rec-ognized by the polyclonal antibody. This allows the calculation of a
match rate or coverage score corresponding to the ratio of the num-ber of proteins recognized by the antibody to the total number of proteins detectable in the sample ( see  Fig.  1 ). Although this method allows a straightforward determination of the range of reactivity of the antibody mixture, adoption of this methodology has been hin-dered by the perceived lack of sensitivity, lack of reproducibility and overall laborious nature of the 2-D electrophoresis and blotting workﬂ  ow. Tools that simplify, standardize, and accelerate 2-D elec-trophoresis and blotting have become available. Advanced electro-phoresis and blotting instrumentation, stable and reproducible pre-cast gels, next-generation imaging and image analysis software all allow this assay to be performed in a reproducible manner in a relatively short time. We have undertaken to demonstrate this by generating coverage scores for a commercially available anti-HCP
antibody against samples derived from CHO cells, a common cell line used in the production of protein therapeutics. We present here a procedure that can be completed in under 24 h. Two replicate 2-D gels are run. One is stained directly with a sensitive ﬂ  uorescent stain, the other is transblotted onto PVDF membrane, stained post-transfer and compared to the other gel to verify transfer efﬁ  ciency. The blotted membrane is stained for total protein and subsequently immunodetected with the anti- HCP antibody preparation to be evaluated. This allows comparison of total protein and immunode-tected protein patters from the same blot, simplifying automated analysis, as the two images are in registry with each other. This dem-onstration experiment was conducted with a commercially available anti-CHO HCP antibody.   2    Materials  Reagents and prepared buffer stocks are from Bio-Rad Laboratories or Sigma-Aldrich except when indicated.

399      1.    For each separation to be run, dilute a portion of each sample containing 150 μg of protein into 200 μl sample solution. For the secreted protein sample, use sample solution 1. For the cell lysate protein sample, use sample solution 2 ( see   Notes 15   and  16 ). At least two separations should be run for each sample ( see   Notes 17   and  18 ).      2.    For each separation run, pipet 200 μl of solution along the center of the channel of the PROTEAN i12 rehydration/equilibration tray. Take care to not introduce air bubbles when expelling the solution.      3.    Using forceps, remove the cover sheet from each IPG strip, then gently place the IPG strip gel-side down onto the solution in the channel. Move the IPG strip back and forth slightly to ensure that the solution is distributed along the length of the IPG strip. Take care to not trap air bubbles beneath the IPG strip ( see   Notes 19   and  20 ).
strip ( see   Notes 19   and  20 ).      4.    Overlay each IPG strip with 5 ml mineral oil. Apply the mineral oil to both ends of the channel and allow it to ﬂ  ow toward the middle of the channel ( see   Note 21  ).      5.    Cover the tray and leave it on a level bench overnight (12–18 h) for complete rehydration.      6.    Using forceps, remove the IPG strips from the rehydration tray, remove excess mineral oil, and place the rehydrated IPG strips gel-side up in the channels of the focusing tray. Position the positive (+) ends of the IPG strips against the positioning stops in each channel.      7.    Wet the gel-side up wicks (notched) with distilled or deionized water and blot off excess water. Use two wicks per IPG strip: place a wick at each end of each IPG strip. Position the elec-trode assemblies in the focusing tray and press down on the green tabs to snap the electrode assemblies into place.
8.    Place the focusing tray with the rehydrated IPG strips on the Peltier platform and connect the electrodes to the instrument. Overlay each IPG strip with 5 ml mineral oil.      9.    Run IEF according to the preset “gradual” protocol for pH 3–10 NL IPG strips: 250 V for 20 min, gradual ramp to 8,000 V over 1 h, 8,000 V for 26,000 Vh. Maintain a current limit of 50 μA throughout. If not proceeding directly to the next step, store the IPG strip at −80 °C ( see   Note 22  ).            1.    Prepare SDS-PAGE Running Buffer by tenfold dilution of 10× Tris/Glycine/SDS electrophoresis buffer. Prepare 1 l for each Criterion Cell to be run (each cell runs two gels).      2.    Melt sufﬁ  cient Agarose Sealing Solution for the second dimen-sions to be run. Each gel requires 1 ml of solution. If the solu-tion has been aliquoted into sealed tubes, it may be melted in 3.2  2-D Electrophoresis, First-Dimension IEF3.3  2-D Electrophoresis, Equilibration, and Second-

400a 95 °C heat block. Otherwise, it may be melted in a boiling water bath ( see   Note 23  ).      3.    Place one IPG strip gel-side up in each channel of a rehydration/equilibration tray, and ﬁ  ll the channels with 4 ml equilibration buffer with 1 % DTT.      4.    Incubate with gentle agitation for 15 min, then decant.      5.    Fill the channels with 4 ml equilibration buffer with 2.5 % iodoacetamide and incubate again for 15 min.      6.    After equilibration, remove the IPG strips and brieﬂ  y rinse with SDS-PAGE running buffer. This step rids the strip of excess iodoacetamide and serves to lubricate the IPG strip for placement on the second dimension.      7.    Position each second-dimension gel cassette in a test tube rack or suitable stand so that it is leaning slightly backwards from vertical.      8.    Place the equilibrated IPG strip (anodic side to the left) onto the long plate with the plastic backing against the plate.
9.    Slide the IPG strip between the plates using a spatula to push against the plastic backing. Ensure that the plastic backing remains fully in contact with the long plate and be careful not to damage the gel with the spatula. Make sure that the IPG strip is positioned directly on top of the second-dimension gel without any bubbles in the interface between the two gel surfaces.      10.    To secure the IPG strip in place, overlay it with molten agarose solution. Avoid trapping air bubbles between the IPG strip and second-dimension gel. Dislodge any bubbles by tapping the plastic backing on top of the strip.      11.    Stand the gel upright and allow the agarose to set for 5–10 min before loading the gel into the electrophoresis cell.      12.    Insert the gel cassette into the electrophoresis cell and ﬁ  ll the buffer chambers with SDS-PAGE running buffer ( see   Note 24  ).      13.    Connect the electrophoresis cell to a power supply. Run the
gels at 50 V for 10 min, then raise the voltage to 250 V ( see   Note 25  ). Run until the bromophenol blue tracking dye reaches the bottom of the gel (approximately 30 min).             1.    There should be at least two gels run for each sample. One is to be stained and the other is to be blotted.      2.    Carefully open the cassette for the gel to be stained and use a spatula to separate the agarose overlay, including the IPG strip, from the polyacrylamide gel.      3.    Carefully peel the gel from the cassette and place it in a tray containing 100 ml Oriole Fluorescent Gel Stain. Place the lid on the staining tray incubate with gentle staining or rocking for 90 min ( see   Note 26  ).   3.4  Staining and BlottingTom Berkelman et al.
401   4.    For each gel to be blotted open a transfer pack and place the anode stack in the middle of the base of the Trans-Blot Turbo cassette. The blotting membrane should be at the top of the stack.      5.    Carefully open the cassette for the gel to be blotted and use a spatula to separate the agarose overlay, including the IPG strip, from the polyacrylamide gel. Peel the gel from the cassette and carefully place it on the anode stack, covering the blotting membrane. Use the roller to remove any air bubbles that may be trapped between the gel and the membrane, or within the transfer stack ( see   Note 27  ). Place the cathode stack on top of the gel and roll once again to remove trapped air.      6.    Place the lid on the cassette and lock it into place by turning the green knob clockwise. Ensure that the locking pins fully engage their locking slots.      7.    Turn on the Trans-Blot Turbo instrument and slide the cas-sette into a cassette bay.
sette into a cassette bay.      8.    Select TURBO, then select 2 MINI OR 1 MIDI GEL, then select RUN for the occupied cassette bay(s). The transfer will take 7 min. At the end of the run, RUN COMPLETE will appear on the screen.      9.    Disassemble the cassette. Remove and discard the cathode stack. Carefully lift the gel and place it in a tray containing 100 ml Oriole Fluorescent Gel Stain. Place the lid on the stain-ing tray incubate with gentle staining or rocking for 90 min ( see   Note 28  ).      10.    Using forceps, remove the membrane and rinse it brieﬂ  y with distilled or de-ionized water ( see   Note 29  ).      11.    Float each membrane, protein side down, in a plastic tray con-taining 7 % acetic acid, 10 % methanol.      12.    Wash each membrane in distilled or deionized water four times for 5 min each.      13.    Stain each membrane for 15 min with 20 ml SYPRO Ruby Protein Blot Stain ( see   Note 30  ).
Protein Blot Stain ( see   Note 30  ).      14.    Wash each membrane in distilled or deionized water two to three times for 1 min.      15.    Capture images of the stained blots with the ChemiDoc MP imager. Use the imager settings for SYPRO Ruby and use the longest possible exposure time that does not result in image saturation.      16.    When each gel (both the unblotted gel and the replicate blot-ted gel) has been in Oriole stain for 90 min, wash brieﬂ  y in distilled or deionized water, and capture a ﬂ  uorescent image with the ChemiDoc MP imager. Use the imager settings for Oriole stain. For the unblotted gel, use the longest possible 2-D Western Blotting for Anti-HCP Evaluation
402exposure time that does not result in image saturation. Use the same exposure time for the replicate blotted gel. Ensure that the zoom setting for all images is the same as used for the stained membrane.            1.    Place each blotted membrane, protein side up, in a plastic tray slightly larger than the membrane. Apply 40 ml of Blocking Solution. Incubate at room temperature for 1 h with gentle shaking.      2.    Dilute the Anti-CHO HCP antibody (primary antibody) 150- fold into Blocking Solution. Prepare 25 ml for each membrane to be processed.      3.    Decant the Blocking Solution from the blotted membranes. Replace with 25 ml of diluted primary antibody prepared in  step 2  . Incubate overnight (at least 12 h) at 4 °C with gentle shaking ( see   Note 31  ).      4.    Decant the antibody solution. Replace with 40 ml TTBS. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min with gentle shaking. Repeat this step four times for a total of ﬁ  ve washes.
5.    Dilute the HRP-conjugated Bovine Anti-Goat antibody  (secondary antibody) 3,000-fold into TTBS. Prepare 25 ml for each membrane to be processed.      6.    Apply 25 ml of diluted secondary antibody to each membrane. Incubate at room temperature for 1 h with gentle shaking.      7.    Wash each membrane with 40 ml TTBS as described in  step 4  . Wash a total of six times, 5 min each.      8.    Mix the Clarity kit components in a 1:1 ratio. Each blot requires 12 ml of the mixed reagent (6 ml of each component).      9.    Place the membrane protein-side up on a clean piece of plastic wrap or plastic sheet protector.      10.    Pour 12 ml of mixed Clarity substrate solution over each mem-brane. Incubate for 5 min ( see   Note 32  ).      11.    Lift the membrane from the substrate solution with forceps. Allow excess substrate solution to drain. Place the membrane in a plastic sheet protector or cover with plastic wrap.
12.    Capture chemiluminescent images of the immunodetected blots with the ChemiDoc MP imager. Image at the same zoom set-ting and resolution used in Subheading  3.4 ,  step 16  . This will require creating a custom imager setting. Under “Application” select “Custom” and insert the settings “No ﬁ  lter,” “No illumi-nation,” and “Binning 1 × 1” ( see   Note 33  ). Adjust the exposure to give good image quality without saturation.      3.5  Immuno-detectionTom Berkelman et al.
403      1.    For each sample, use Image Lab software (used to capture the images on the ChemiDoc MP) to open the images for the SYPRO Ruby-stained blot and the immunodetected blot. Crop both images to the edge of the membrane. If necessary, ﬁ rst rotate each image so that the edges of the membrane are parallel with the frame of the image. This will ensure that the stained blot image and the Western blot image are in registry for analysis with PDQuest software. Export the images for analysis. ( File > Export > Export for Analysis  ). This creates 16 bit tiff images.      2.    Launch PDQuest. Open both of the ﬁ  les exported from Image Lab.      3.    Crop the images to include only the area containing well resolved protein spots. Use the Advanced Crop function to ensure that the cropped images are in registry with each other. Place the crosshair on a recognizable feature common to both images ( Edit > Image > Advanced Crop > Deﬁ  ne Crop Area,    see  Fig.  2 ).
see  Fig.  2 ).       4.    Create a new experiment ( File > New Experiment  ). Select both of the cropped images. Move through the next set of screens by clicking “Next.” This will select the default options.      5.    Follow the instructions on the Spot Detection Parameter Wizard. Increase the sensitivity to maximize the number of spots identiﬁ  ed ( see  Fig.  3 ).       6.    Select  Proceed  . In the next dialog box, select the cropped image of the stained gel as the Master gel. Select “Add unmatched spots from all gel images to the Master gel.” This will create an artiﬁ  cial image containing all of the detected spots from both the stained blot and the immunodetected Western blot ( see  Fig.  4 ).       7.    Choose default values by clicking  Next   through the successive dialog boxes. The software will calculate matches and display the Master image, the blot images and an Experiment Summary with match rates ( see  Fig.  5 ). “Match Rate 2” for the Western
blot image is the ratio of the number of protein spots recog-nized by the antibody to the total number of proteins detect-able in the sample ( see  Fig.  6 ).        8.    Choose  View > Spot > Show Crosshairs   or press F5 to show the detected spots ( see  Fig.  7 ).       9.    Show matched spots by selecting elect  Analyze > Analysis Set Manager  …, then  Create   and  Matching   ( see  Fig.  8 ). The resulting images will have identiﬁ  ed spots marked with a col-ored “+” and matched spots marked with an “x” in a different color. This will aid in the determination of whether or not a spot identiﬁ  cation or match is valid ( see  Fig.  9 ).     3.6  Software Analysis and Generation of a Match Rate for Assessment of Antibody Coverage2-D Western Blotting for Anti-HCP Evaluation

405   10.    Determine a more accurate match rate by deleting incorrectly identiﬁ  ed spots. These can often be visually identiﬁ  ed near the edges of the image. In this case shown in Fig.  10 , a series of spots along the top edge of the blot image probably do not correspond to real proteins. Delete spurious spots by selecting  Edit > Spot > Remove Spot  . The spots are erased by clicking on the spot or drawing a box around a set of spots. This  operation should be performed both on the Raw 2-D image and on the Master.       11.    Select  Edit > Experiment Summary   to display the ﬁ  nal cor-rected match rate ( see  Fig.  11 ).       12.    If desired, the match may be further reﬁ  ned by manually add-ing and deleting spots. Spot matches may be systematically veriﬁ ed using the Spot Review Tool ( Analyze > Spot Review    see  Fig.  12 ).

4094    Notes      1.    Solutions containing urea are prepared immediately before use.      2.    It is convenient to use a concentrated stock solution of Bromophenol Blue, but this dye will not dissolve in unbuf-fered water. It is therefore prepared in Tris base solution.      3.    Other pH ranges may be used. pH 3–10 NL (non-linear) was chosen for this experiment because it covers most of the range of protein p I ’s. This non-linear gradient is ﬂ  atter in the region of the gradient where most proteins are found, thereby spread-ing them out and allowing resolution of more individual proteins.      4.    Equilibration buffer is highly viscous and it may be difﬁ  cult to stir efﬁ  ciently. Allow several hours for the urea to dissolve into the liquid components.      5.    The amount of Equilibration solution with DTT or iodoacet-amide may be scaled up or down depending on the number of IPG strips run. These solutions may be prepared from aliquoted
Equilibration buffer ( see  Subheading  2.3   step 3  ). Frozen tubes of Equilibration buffer should be allowed to thaw slowly in a beaker of water (do not heat).     Fig. 11    Corrected match rate         Fig. 12    Spot review         2-D Western Blotting for Anti-HCP Evaluation
410   6.    This solution contains SDS and is highly prone to boiling over. It should be microwaved at low power with constant  monitoring. When the solution starts to boil over, turn off the power, remove from the microwave oven and swirl before returning to the microwave oven. Repeat until the agarose is fully dissolved. Aliquots of agarose sealing solution will solidify and can be re-melted before use in a 95 °C heat block or by immersion in boiling water.      7.    This stock solution gives 1× TBS with a composition of 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl.      8.    Non-fat dry milk generally gives high-stringency, low back-ground immunodetection. Alternative blocking reagents may be substituted.      9.    This primary detection antibody is from goat, necessitating the use of an anti-goat secondary detection reagent.      10.    This imaging instrument allows both ﬂ  uorescent and chemi-luminescent imaging at the same resolution with the same
camera. This simpliﬁ  es alignment and matching of the total protein (ﬂ  uorescent) image and immunodetected (chemilu-minescent) image.      11.    This method could be applied to cell culture supernatant and cellular lysate prepared from other cell types.      12.    Alternative cell culture conditions may be employed, but cells should be grown in protein-free, deﬁ  ned medium so that  no proteins that do not derive from CHO cells will be found in the cell culture medium. Suspension culturing will result in a higher concentration of secreted protein in the growth medium and will require less concentration to produce a sample to be analyzed by 2-D electrophoresis.      13.    Concentrated cell culture supernatant contains interfering substances that will prevent effective analysis by 2-D electro-phoresis. The 2-D Cleanup Kit is a convenient means for removing these substances and further concentrating the sam-
ple by selective precipitation. Other methods, such as acetone precipitation [ 8 ], have been used successfully. The dry protein pellet may be slow to dissolve. Brief sonication will accelerate the process but do not allow the material to heat up.      14.    Protein is most accurately quantitated in solution lacking detergent or reductant, so concentrated protein samples are ﬁ rst prepared without these additives. The detergent (CHAPS) and reductant (DTT) are supplied by the solution in which the sample is diluted prior to ﬁ  rst-dimension SDS.      15.    IEF may be conducted in either 8 M urea or in 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea. The urea/thiourea mixture results in better protein solubilization, particularly of hydrophobic proteins, but urea Tom Berkelman et al.
411alone generally results in a cleaner, higher resolution 2-D pat-tern [ 9 ]. In this experiment, the secreted proteins, which are generally very soluble, are separated in a solution containing urea alone. Cell lysate protein, which contains more hydro-phobic proteins, is separated in a solution containing a urea/thiourea mixture.      16.    Each of the sample solution components has a speciﬁ  c role in promoting high resolution IEF separation. Urea and thiourea are protein denaturants that promote the complete unfolding of polypeptide chains so that all ionizable groups are exposed to the solution. CHAPS is a detergent that prevents protein aggregation and promotes solubility. DTT is a thiol reductant that breaks disulﬁ  de bonds within and between polypeptide chains, and maintains proteins in a fully reduced state. Carrier ampholytes enhance protein solubility by minimizing protein aggregation due to charge–charge interactions. Bromophenol
blue is a tracking dye. Its inclusion is not necessary, but clear-ance of the dye from the IPG strip during electrophoresis pro-vides a visual conﬁ  rmation that electrical current is being delivered to the IPG strip appropriately.      17.    Each sample is run in replicate and separated on two second- dimension gels, one of which is stained and the other blotted.      18.    Recombinant therapeutics can be expressed either as secreted proteins recovered from the culture medium or as cellular pro-teins that are recovered from cell lysates. The HCPs found in either case are expected to differ from each other. Cell culture medium, however, is expected to contain some proteins that are released from cells that lyse during growth and transfer. This experiment analyzes reactivity of an antibody directed against secreted HCP in both a secreted protein- and cell lysate-derived samples ( see  Figs.  13  and  14 ).        19.    Handle IPG strips from the ends using forceps.
20.    The sample is applied to the entire length of the immobilized pH gradient by rehydration into a dry IPG strip. As voltage is applied, each peptide in the sample focuses to a narrow zone in the pH gradient corresponding to its p I .      21.    Mineral oil prevents evaporation of the sample solution.      22.    Additional details of the sample application and IEF procedure may be found in the user manual for the PROTEAN i12 IEF System.      23.    It will take at least 10 min for the agarose sealing solution to melt. It is best to start this prior to equilibrating the IPG strips for the second dimension.      24.    Although size standards are not strictly required for this appli-cation, they may be applied to the gel at this stage if desired. 2-D Western Blotting for Anti-HCP Evaluation
412Colored standards (e.g. Precision Plus Protein WesternC Standard, Bio-Rad) can serve to verify electrophoresis and transfer and to orient the blotting membrane and determine which side contains transferred protein. Apply 5 μl of standards solution into the standards well using a syringe or gel loading pipet tip.      25.    The 10 min low voltage step is to allow gradual transfer of the proteins from the IPG strip to the second-dimension gel. This reduces vertical streaking and gives a higher resolution second- dimension separation.      26.    The ﬂ  uorescent stain used is resistant to photobleaching and shielding the staining reaction from normal room light should not be necessary. If the gel is under bright light, or in sunlight, the staining tray may be covered with aluminum foil.      27.    The gel is delicate and easily torn. Handle the gel wearing gloves and avoid touching the gel anywhere besides the edges
and corners. The gel is best held by the bottom corners. Place the gel on the anode stack and membrane by draping the gel over the membrane starting from the top of the gel.

413gel is in place on the membrane, it should not be lifted again or moved.      28.    The gel is stained following transfer to verify completeness of transfer.      29.    At this stage, the membrane may be allowed to dry and can be stored for several weeks at room temperature between sheets of blotting paper.      30.    SYPRO Ruby Protein Blot Stain is a sensitive ﬂ  uorescent stain for proteins blotted onto PVDF or nitrocellulose membranes. It is used in this application because it does not interfere with subsequent immunodetection [ 10 ].      31.    Alternatively, this step may be carried out for 1 h at room temperature.      32.    The substrate solution should form a puddle that covers the blot. Ensure that the surface of the blot is completely covered with substrate solution.      33.    The default settings for capture of chemiluminescence images take advantage of binning in order to shorten exposure times

FFE is a highly versatile technology applied in the ﬁ  eld of protein analysis. It is superior to native PAGE due to its fast continuous processing of sample at high resolution. Additionally, the dynamic separation range from ions, peptides, to proteins, protein complexes, up to  organelles, and whole cells makes it the method of choice in the analysis of proteins. FFE is carried out in an
aqueous medium without inducing any solid matrix, such as acrylamide, so that it simpliﬁ  es the analysis of protein complexes for the downstream analysis. Here, we describe the novel zone electrophoresis interval method (IZE-FFE) for separation of protein complexes from the thylakoid membrane of Arabidopsis thali-ana by charge only. Protein complexes isolated by IZE FFE were characterized according to molecular weight by Blue Native PAGE and were proteins stained with coomassie.

416determination by crystallization requires the biological material in a liquid environment after separation. In the last years, native PAGE has become an established laboratory standard for the  separation of protein complexes [ 1 – 4 ]. The system provides  excellent resolution, but it provides the isolated protein complexes in a gel environment and high-resolution separation of complexes takes 16 hours   .  The problem of releasing the protein complexes from the gel is solvable; however, the additional steps compromise complex  stability and require time before the molecules can be analyzed further. In general, there are three problems with native gels that can be overcome by using free-ﬂ  ow electrophoresis. Disassembly of protein complexes at the liquid–gel interface is avoided, an upper limit for entering of complexes into the gel is circumvented, and separation of the complexes is tremendously speeded up. Why
is it essential to overcome the gel-based limitations? The liquid/gel junction confronts proteins with a deleterious molecular barrier for entry into the molecular sieve network and the integrity of many complexes that fulﬁ  ll the entry size requirement is compromised. For supercomplex analysis, the molecular mass entry limit of high- resolution polyacrylamide gels according to molecular mass stan-dards appears at about 1.5 MDa; although separation of assemblies with a molecular mass of about 10 MDa has been claimed [ 5 ,  6 ]. Size exclusion limits an analysis of functional cell structures that operate in supramolecular arrangements. Analysis of cellular com-plexity and characterization of the biochemical dynamics requires to analyze complex arrangements over large molecular mass differ-ences top down, e.g. from the cell to the organelle, to the mem-brane, and the polysomal/cotranslational level in one experimental
system. A barrier-free analysis strategy is therefore essential to ana-lyze the dynamics of regulatory cell processes. Finally, many com-plexes are labile and disintegrate during prolonged separation. It is therefore essential to keep the time between sample preparation and analysis of the cell components as short as possible.  Free-ﬂ  ow electrophoresis offers a solution to overcome the constraints of native PAGE. As the name implies, the technique is gel-free. Using interval zone electrophoresis, separation of mem-brane protein complexes of interest has been achieved within about 6 min (Fig.  1 ). Separation is based on the native charge of the complexes and resolution is achieved by mobility differences in deﬁ ned pH zones. The separation technology can be automated and has been used for analytical and preparative tasks [ 6 – 8 ]. Separated protein fractions are pooled in microtiter plates and hence are directly accessible in the liquid state [ 8 ]. Steps for analy-
sis of the free-ﬂ  ow fractions, including native and SDS-PAGE, spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single particle analysis have successfully been conducted and optimized recently.   Lutz Andreas Eichacker et al.

4193    Methods  The FFE system performs electrophoretic separations in patented and well-deﬁ  ned separation solutions without the use of a solid (e.g. polyacrylamide) matrix. The gel-free basis enables the high- resolution separation of charged or chargeable entities like cell organelles, protein complexes and proteins, or peptides on a fast, preparative, and continuous basis. Fluid-phase separation is oper-ated in the three modes zone electrophoresis (ZE), including the novel iZE method, isoelectric focusing (IEF), and isotachophoresis. The system enriches low-abundant proteins with high reproduc-ibility. The sample is applied using a peristaltic pump and is induced into a separation chamber consisting of two parallel plates. Under laminar ﬂ  ow, the sample is transported within a thin (0.2–0.4 mm) ﬁ lm of aqueous medium formed between the two plates. The plates are bordered by two electrodes that generate a high- voltage electric
ﬁ eld perpendicular to the laminar ﬂ  ow. Charged particles like ions, peptides, proteins, organelles, membrane fragments, or whole cells that are deﬂ  ected in this electric ﬁ  eld are separated and seamlessly fractionated into microtiter plates.  The iZE method described in this chapter delivers excellent resolution for the separation of protein complexes and membrane proteins. Compared to IEF separations, media require no addition of polymers like Hydroxy-ethyl-propyl-cellulose (HPMC) to sup-press electroendosmotic ﬂ  ow. This enables an easy concentration of the separated samples by ultra-ﬁ  ltration and ensures highest compatibility for any downstream technology like, e.g. native and SDS-PAGE, HPLC, MS, and ELISA.  The protocol describes how protein assemblies from the thyla-koid membrane of  Arabidopsis thaliana   can be prepared for iZE- FFE separation. Separation by iZE-FFE is based on the charge of
the protein assemblies. The resolution of the iZE-FFE protocol is visualized using blue native PAGE as a native PAGE approach. In general, blue-native PAGE is intended to separate protein com-plexes in a state that reﬂ  ects the physiologically relevant functional state of the protein assembly [ 4 ]. It is therefore advisable to mini-mize protein complex degradation through sample preparation on ice and fast electrophoresis at 4 °C. Solubilization of thylakoid membranes resulted in the formation of membrane assemblies of chlorophyll-binding thylakoid membrane protein complexes that were charge separated by iZE-FFE within 6 min. The composition of the FFE fractions was analyzed in a BN-PAGE approach. Here, one to several protein bands have been determined per FFE frac-tion. Unique protein compositions were identiﬁ  ed per every  second FFE fraction that was loaded for BN-PAGE separation. Especially, ﬁ  ve distinctive maxima were determined after the FFE
fractionation (Fig.  1 , fractions 35, 37, 49, 53 and 59). BN-PAGE Free Flow Electrophoresis for Separation…
420lanes and proteins bands were analyzed further by denaturing SDS-PAGE and proteins and complexes were identiﬁ  ed by mass spectrometry. Data revealed that iZ-FFE was perfectly suited to separate the highly complex array of membrane protein complexes from the photosynthetic thylakoid membrane. Protein complexes and subcomplexes were well detected upon Coomassie staining and white light scanning (Fig.  1 ). Detailed characterization of pro-tein complexes and subcomplexes is presently under investigation. Separation of the protein complexes by native PAGE is based on a sieving of the complexes by the acrylamide concentration- dependent pore size of the gel. The method presented here cor-responds to a 3–12 % (v/v) linear gradient separating gel (Fig.  1 ). The gradient gel facilitated a separation of molecular weight stan-dards in the molecular weight range of 66–1,500 kDa (Fig.  1 ).       1.     Arabidopsis thaliana   plants are grown on soil for 3–4 weeks in a

Resuspend thylakoids in 3 mL wash buffer using paintbrush.      17.    Transfer into glass homogenizer and lever piston three times.      18.    Transfer into 5 mL plastic tube.      19.    Clean homogenizer with 2 mL of wash buffer and homogenize 2× and collect in 5 mL tube.      20.    Measure the concentration of chlorophyll. Transfer 10 μL thy-lakoid membrane extract into 990 μL 80 % Acetone at 4 °C. Determine absorbance at 652 nm. Calculate the concentration of Chl ( μg/μL).      21.    For storage of thylakoid membranes determine Chl concentra-tion and dilute in storage buffer to a concentration of 1 μg Chl/μL.      22.    Freeze aliquots of 100 μL in liquid N 2  and store tubes at −80 °C.            1.    Use thylakoid membranes corresponding to 300 μg Chl.
2.    Concentrate thylakoid membranes by centrifugation at 7,500 ×  g  and 4 °C for 10 min and discard supernatant.      3.

Load supernatant of the different solubilizations onto FFE ( see  Fig.  1  for separation of supernatant 2) ( see   Note 2  ).        A native separation buffer and the novel interval Zone Electrophoresis protocol is used for protein complex separation.
FFE is conducted at 10 °C using the following conditions:  The experiments run in a horizontal position of the separation chamber using a 0.2 mm spacer. The voltage is adjusted to 1,600 V which results in a current of ~85 mA. The residence time in the separation chamber is approximately 4.5 min per interval. Fractions are collected in polypropylene microtiter plates numbered from 1 (anode) through 96 (cathode).3.2  Solubilization of Thylakoid Membranes from  Arabidopsis thaliana  for Native FFE3.3  FFE MethodFree Flow Electrophoresis for Separation…
422    1.    Place the sample to the ice cooled sample holder on the FFE system ( see   Notes 3  – 7 ).      2.    Clean interior surface of chamber: move separation chamber to an upright position and open the pairs of chamber clamps simultaneously. Use the following sequence for cleaning (H 2 O dist  ≤ 18 nΩ/20 μS):water– isopropanol–petrolether–iso-propanol–water ( see   Note 8  ).      3.    Apply the spacer (0.2 mm) without covering the inlets, apply the electrode membrane (soaked in Glycerol/Isopropanol, mix 1:1) and the ﬁ  lter paper (0.3 mm), soaked in distilled water onto the membrane.      4.    Close separation chamber: lift the Plexiglas side of the chamber to meet the mirrored side, ﬁ  rst fasten central and adjacent clamps loosely (release chamber clamps by two turns each). Then fasten central and adjacent clamps tight, close top and bottom clamps, place fractionation plate on top of fraction-ation housing, ﬁ  nally make sure that all inlets of media and
counterﬂ  ow are free and are not covered by the spacer.      5.    Fill separation chamber with degassed dist. water: open (lift) valves at the top of the chamber to degas the chamber, fasten wedge clamps (I1–I9) of the media pump and place tubes in reservoir ﬁ  lled with H 2 O dist , switch on medium pump on  control board. When the chamber is totally ﬂ  ushed and free of air add counter ﬂ  ow by closing wedge clamps on pump.      6.    Set up the Electrode Buffer, Stabilization Buffers and counter ﬂ ow buffer and separation buffers.      7.    Connect anode (+) and cathode (−) electrolytes, connect plas-tic cover and start electrode pump.      8.    Adjust the media ﬂ  ow rate to 120 mL/h and start the media ﬂ ow, wait for 15 min to ﬂ  ush the buffers in.      9.    Adjust the voltage to 1,600 V, set the current to 150 mA.      10.    Set the sample ﬂ  ow rate to 4,000 μL/h.      11.    Set the media pump ﬂ  ow rate to 16.4 digits.      12.    Turn on media pump.
12.    Turn on media pump.      13.    Turn on sample pump and ﬂ  ush the sample in for 70 s, then switch the sample pump to backwards direction for 2 s and turn off the sample pump.      14.    Wait 20 additional seconds, and then turn on the high voltage.      15.    Wait 30 s, and then adjust the media pump to 3.6 units.      16.    Wait 4 min, then turn the high voltage off and elute the  separated samples with a media pump speed of 28.8 units.   Lutz Andreas Eichacker et al.
423   17.    After 100 s the sample can be collected with a MTP or deep well plate, therefore place the MTP in the fraction collection device and collect for 120 s.      18.    If more separated sample is needed, repeat the  steps 8  – 17 .        For native LN- and BN-PAGE analysis, a volume of 200 μL of each IZE fraction was concentrated by centrifugation using Viva-Spin 100,000 MWCO tubes at 10 °C (Viva-Products, Inc., Littleton, MA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol until a volume of 25 μL was retained.        1.    Prepare cathode-, anode- and gel-media for BN-PAGE-gels. Store at 4 °C.      2.    Label the position of the wells on the outer cassette with a felt pen and remove the comb carefully from the native gel ( see   Note 9  ).      3.    Assemble cassette sandwich within electrophoretic apparatus.      4.    Fill in cathode buffer into the upper buffer chamber.      5.    Rinse the wells with cathode buffer ( see   Note 10  ).
6.    Underlay the samples into the wells using a micro syringe or disposable pipette tips ( see   Note 11  ).      7.    Fill anode buffer in the lower buffer chamber until electrode is immersed.      8.    Place the gel chamber in a Styrofoam box, use 2 minus 20 °C cooling pads to maintain low temperature during separation.      9.    Complete assembly of electrophoresis unit and connect to power supply.      10.    Set the power supply to limit voltage. Use 35 V constant. Set mA and W to maximal values. Run overnight for highest resolution. Apply power to electrophoretic set ( see   Note 12  ).      11.    Stop electrophoresis when the front composed of Ponceau S/chlorophyll has reached the bottom of the separating gel ( see   Note 13  ).      12.    For further analysis of protein complexes like absorbance or mass spectroscopy measurements open sandwich and cut chlo-rophyll gel bands or stain proteins before further processing of sample of interest.

424   2.    Depending on the organism and membrane that should be solubilized, different detergent concentrations and mixtures need to be tested individually.      3.    Turbidity of protein samples is an indication of insufﬁ  cient solubility and/or protein precipitation. Protein samples may not be turbid; otherwise the resolution of the electrophoretic separation will be poor, turbid protein samples have to be cleared by centrifugation prior to the FFE separation.      4.    The salt concentration of samples may not exceed 25 mM. If the conductivity of the sample due to the salt concentration is too high, it has to be desalted or diluted to reach <25 mM of total salt concentration.      5.    Generally, the sample should be as similar to the separation media as possible in behalf of the chemical and physical proper-ties like density, conductivity and viscosity.      6.    Additionally, tolerable additives for sample preparations can be:
Urea up to 8 M; 0.1–1 % of detergents like CHAPS, CHAPSO, Digitonin, Dodecyl- β- D -maltoside, Octyl- β- D - glucoside , Triton-X-114 (IEF); up to 50 mM DTT.      7.    Protein sample is usually applied on the cathodic inlet, only few samples work better when applied at the middle or anodic inlet; this can be checked for each sample.      8.    The system has to be cleaned thoroughly prior use, usually the separation chamber is wiped with water, isopropanol and petrolether and again with isopropanol and water to make sure any organic and anorganic contamination is cleaned.      9.    Depending on the electrophoresis apparatus, the gel comb has to be removed before or after assembly of the sandwich in the electrophoresis apparatus.      10.    Fill 50 mL syringe with cathode buffer and use needle with diameter thinner than spacer thickness to rinse wells.      11.    If a micro syringe is used, rinse with anode buffer before
applying a new sample. If wells remain unused, load detergent mixture 1 or 2 to the empty well.      12.    Depending on laboratory condition and available equipment, the run of the native gel electrophoresis could be done in the cold room. In order to control the running behavior, check temperature and pH of cathode buffer in upper buffer chamber.      13.    Gel requires about 18 h to complete separation of the solubi-lized protein complexes (Invitrogen, 35 V constant, Gel length = 100 mm).         Lutz Andreas Eichacker et al.

However, the co-migration of several proteins in the same spot is still a major limitation which detracts from
the accuracy of comparative quantiﬁ  cation and prevents unambiguous post- translational modiﬁ  cations (PTMs) detection.  A protocol based on traditional polyacrylamide gel IEF sample fractionation, and followed by two consecutive SDS-PAGE electrophoreses alleviates co-migration limitations.

The introduction of inert support materials such as paper,  agarose, and acrylamide greatly improved the resolving power by eliminating the continuous mixing of the sample components asso-
ciated with the current-driven convection.  Among the various separation media, polyacrylamide gel has gained the most widespread use. In addition to preventing thermal convection, the polyacrylamide matrix acts as a molecular size selective sieve increasing the resolving power. Therefore, during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) protein separation is based on a combination of charge, shape, and size.
428 Two additional major technical improvements turned this  veteran technique into a high-throughput quantitative proteomic analytical method.  First, the introduction of the negatively charged sodium dodecyl sulfate detergent (SDS) brought two unique advances [ 2 – 4 ]. SDS binds to most proteins at a constant ratio of 1.4 g SDS per g protein and forces globular proteins to adopt a rod-like conformation so that the migration rate of the proteins during SDS- PAGE is inversely proportional to their molecular weight. An additional advantage is that the detergent action of SDS solubilizes insoluble proteins including membrane proteins and disrupts supramolecular assem-blies and this makes SDS PAGE a method of choice for resolving complex mixtures of proteins.  Second, the discontinuous buffer system which was introduced by Laemmli [ 5 ] is by far the most commonly used PAGE protocol for protein separation. The advantage of the discontinuous buffer
system is that the resolving power is increased by ﬁ  rst concentrat-ing the proteins together in a small zone, before they are separated as a function of their molecular weight. This is achieved by casting the gels in two sections with different properties: a ﬁ  rst (the stack-ing gel) and a second (the resolving gel). The stacking gel has large pores so the proteins are not sieved but the pH is chosen so that the cations and anions from the electrode and gel buffers migrate as two separate fronts. This concentrates the proteins of the sample in the very narrow zone between the fronts. When the proteins reach the second, resolving, portion of the gel, the two ionic fronts disappear and the proteins are separated, thanks to the SDS, according to their molecular weight.  In 1975 O’Farrel [ 6 ] introduced two-dimensional electropho-resis by combining isoelectric focusing (IEF) of proteins in the ﬁ  rst dimension and SDS-PAGE as the second separation dimension
(2-dimensional SDS PAGE, 2D-PAGE). This improved the utility of gel electrophoresis for resolving complex mixtures of proteins but still left the problem of gel to gel variability (due to the fact that known and unknown have to be run on different gels).  Quantitative 2D-gel-dependent proteomics became feasible with 2D ﬂ uorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), and this technique has gained wide acceptance because it alleviates some of the problems that have bedeviled the use of 2D-PAGE. 2D-DIGE essentially differs from the traditional 2D-PAGE in that it relies on the pre-electrophoretic labeling of samples with several ﬂ  uorescent dyes [ 7 ]. The use of internal standard, made by pooling the different samples, provides a reference for each protein. This eliminated the gel to gel variations and greatly facilitated the quantitative compari-sons across gels for many different experimental conditions.
However, despite these signiﬁ  cant improvements, there is still a major limitation, i.e., the co-migration of several proteins in the same spot. This prevents the unambiguous identiﬁ  cation of  proteins Sergio Mauro et al.
429and detracts from the accuracy of comparative quantiﬁ  cation, and complicates the link between identiﬁ  cation, quantiﬁ  ca tion, and spe-ciﬁ c protein detection such as Western blot or speciﬁ  c staining. It also prevents unambiguous PTMs detection [ 8 ].  Recent improvements in the performance of mass spectrom-etry have facilitated the development of high-precision quantita-tive proteomic using non-gel-based techniques such as ICATs and iTRAQ. Nevertheless, extensive studies comparing gel-free and in- gel proteomics strategies show that there are useful comple-mentarities between the two [ 8 – 10 ]. Actually, in spite of some shortcomings, 2D-PAGE, and in particular 2D-DIGE, remains a powerful, rapid, and robust approach.  Here, we describe a simple and rapid 3D protocol (3D-DIGE) which addresses the problem of co-migration interference. In con-trast to previous studies [ 11 – 13 ], our protocol has a wide range of
application in quantitative proﬁ  ling of complex proteomes. It is based on traditional polyacrylamide gel IEF sample fractionation. This is followed by two consecutive SDS-PAGE electrophoreses. The use of two different buffer systems for SDS-PAGE is central to our approach which has been validated by comparing mass spectrometry (MS) results for protein identiﬁ  cation from 2D and 3D gels [ 14 ].  2    Materials  Unless indicated otherwise all solutions are prepared with Milli-Q water (resistivity, 18.2 M Ω cm at 25 °C).       1.

For preparative 2D-DIGE gels, add 20 μL DMF so as to recon-stitute a 20 mM working dye solution (only Cy3 is available).      3.    For analytical 2D-DIGE gels, add 50 μL DMF so as to reconsti-tute a 2 mM working dye solution (Cy3 and Cy5 are available).      4.    Vortex for 30 s.      5.    Centrifuge for 30 s at 12,000 ×  g .      6.    If not used directly the solutions may be stored at −20 °C up to 3 months.         In order to eliminate variation between gels, treatment effects are measured by reference to an “internal standard.” This standard is a mix of an equal amount of all protein extractions. Thus for our heat treatment experiment we have three sorts of sample: control, treatment, and internal standard.    1.    In an Eppendorf tube, add the sample volume corresponding to 5 μg protein ( see   Note 2  ).

432      1.    Add the sample volume corresponding to 100 μg protein to an Eppendorf tube (the ﬁ  nal volume should not exceed 120 μL).      2.    Add 2 μL of 20 mM TCEP.      3.    Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h.      4.    Add 4 μL of Dye for preparative gel ( see   Note 4  ).      5.    Incubate 30 min at 37 °C.      6.    Stop the reaction by adding DTT (130 mM ﬁ  nal), IPG buffer 4–7 (2 % ﬁ  nal), and sample buffer up to max. 120 μL.      7.    Samples are ready for use or for conservation at −80 °C until use.         The protocol below describes the cup-loading approach that has been used for both the analytical and preparative gels using 24 cm long IPG-strips pH 4–7 for samples prepared as above.       1.    Carefully level the reswelling tray so to ensure homogenous rehydration of the strip.      2.    Mix 450 μL of the IPG-strip rehydration buffer with 8.9 μL of 1 M DTT stock solution.      3.    Deliver 450 μL of this mix into the center of one of the slots of
the re-swelling tray and remove any air bubble.      4.    Remove the protective cover from the IPG-strip ( see   Note 5  ).      5.    Position the IPG-strip with the gel side down and slide it back and forth to remove air bubbles.      6.    Overlay the IPG-strip with 3 mL of IPG cover ﬂ  uid to limit evaporation.      7.    Allow the strip to rehydrate at room temperature for at least 16 h but do not exceed 24 h.            1.    Place the IPGphor Manifold onto the cooling plate of the Ettan IPGphor3.      2.    Remove the IPG-strip from the re-swelling tray with forceps.      3.    Put the rehydrated IPG-gel strip into a slot of the IPGphor Manifold, gel side up making sure that the acidic end of the strip is facing toward the anode.      4.    Moisten two paper electrode wicks with 150 μL  distilled   water and remove any excess of water by blotting with ﬁ  lter paper.      5.    Apply these electrode wicks at the terminals of the IPG-strips.
6.    Clip the moveable electrodes above the electrode wicks.      7.    Position the moveable sample cup near the anode.      8.    Ensure that there are no leaks in the sample cup, by ﬁ  lling the sample cup with Immobiline DryStrip Cover Fluid.

433   9.    Apply 108 mL of DryStrip Cover Fluid to cover the Manifold slots.      10.    For analytical gels, mix thoroughly 5 μg of Cy3-labeled inter-nal standard and 5 μg of Cy5 experimental sample.      11.    Load the mix in the sample cup.      12.    For preparative gels load up to 120 μL of the protein mix in the sample cup.      13.    Close the lid of the Ettan IPGphor3.      14.    Program the ETTAN IPGphore3 as follows in order to focus the proteins overnight:    (a)    Step and hold 300 V/3 h.      (b)    Gradient 600 V/3 h.      (c)    Gradient 1,000 V/8 h.      (d)    Gradient 8,000 V/3 h.      (e)    8,000 V until 50,000 Vh are reached.          15.    After IEF completion, IPG-strips are either used immediately or after removal of excess DryStrip Cover Fluid, stored at −80 °C in a rigid container.               1.    Prepare 10 mL (fresh or just thawed from the freezer) of the
focused strips equilibration buffer containing 50 mM DTT added prior to use.      2.    Prepare 10 mL (fresh or just thawed from the freezer) of the focused strips equilibration buffer containing 50 mM IAA added prior to use.      3.    Equilibrate the IPG strip with gentle shaking for 10 min in equilibration buffer containing DTT.      4.    Equilibrate the IPG strip with gentle shaking for 10 min in equilibration buffer containing IAA.      5.    Rinse the IPG-strip with DIGE cathode buffer.            1.    Using a forceps and spatula place the IPG-strip on top of the precast polyacrylamide gel cassette, ensuring close contact between the strip and the polyacrylamide gel surface. Both ana-lytical and preparative electrophoreses have been performed using precast 12.5 % polyacrylamide 2D-DIGE gels.      2.    Apply 4 μL of the appropriate protein molecular weight mark-ers blend to a 10 mm × 5 mm piece of ﬁ  lter paper.
3.    Place the ﬁ  lter paper next to the IPG strip.      4.    Add 1 mL of hot agarose sealing solution over the IPG strip and the ﬁ  lter paper.      5.    Place the gel in Ettan DALTsix and ﬁ  ll any empty slots with blank cassette inserts.   3.2  2D- and 3D-Difference Gel Electrophoresis3.2.1  Equilibration of IPG-Strips3.2.2  2D Difference Gel Electrophoresis3D Differential Electrophoresis
434   6.    Wet the upper buffer chamber seals with some cathode buffer and slide the chamber into place.      7.    Fill the upper chamber with cathode buffer (approximately 1.2 L).      8.    Fill the lower chamber with anode buffer up to the ﬁ  ll line.      9.    Run the gels initially at constant 80 V for 1 h and then at 12 mA/gel overnight (1.5 W/gel) until the bromophenol blue front reaches the end of the gel.            1.    Capture the gels with a DIGE compatible imaging system.      2.    Perform data analysis (differentially expressed protein spots) with a DIGE compatible software package    [ 15 – 17 ].      3.    Pick corresponding gel spots by hand or robot.          The 3D deconvolution of the 2D spots into their individual  protein components could be systematically achieved for any 2D spot. However we have used it to study changes in  Solanum tuberosum   leaf proteomes following a heat shock treatment and we have
shown that a robust gel image-based quantitative comparison of protein expression levels could be performed on 3D gels [ 14 ].  The full 3D-DIGE protocol has two steps: analytical and  preparative (Fig.  1 ):     1.    The analytical 3D-DIGE identiﬁ  es and quantiﬁ  es the differ-ences between samples in the protein expression proﬁ  le. This is achieved by measuring the intensity of ﬂ  uorescence of Cy3 and Cy5 dyes in each spot which has been resolved in the second dimension (2D-DIGE). The analytical 3D-DIGE step resolves and quantiﬁ  es the protein components present in each protein spot identiﬁ  ed in the 2D step (Fig.  2 ).       2.    The preparative 3D-DIGE step was developed because 3D spots derived from 3D analytical gels may not contain sufﬁ  cient material for downstream applications such as mass spectrome-try and Western blotting analysis.      Our protocol begins with the 2D-DIGE procedure as described
above. Then the spot picking list is used to command a mechanical spot picker and the excised samples are the starting point for a third, or 3D-DIGE analysis.  The excised spots corresponding to control and heat shock are delivered in a multiwell plate    1.    Remove any liquid that has leached out from the excised gel fragments.      2.    Select a gel system as a function of the apparent molecular mass (MM) of the excised spots, for MM ≥55 kDa load the excised spot onto a NuPage Tris Acetate 7 % acrylamide gel; for MM ≤55 kDa use a Bis-Tris 4–12 % acrylamide MES buffer gel.   3.2.3  Two- and Three- Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis Image Capture and Analysis3.2.4  Quantitative 3D-DIGE for Comparative Proteomics Using Analytical 2D-DIGE GelsSergio Mauro et al.

Extracts from internal standard and heat- treated leaves (42 °C, 1 h) samples were differentially labeled with the Cy5 and Cy3 and separated by two- dimensional electrophoresis on 24 cm (pH 4–7) IPG strips and 12.5 % polyacrylamide gels.

The spots of interest ( see  arrow  in  a ) from control (C) and heat-treated leaves (T) were excised from two different analytical DIGE gels and re- electrophoresed in a NuPage Tris acetate 7 % gel. Each spot resolved into two, S1 and S2. A 3D view of the

The NuPage Tris acetate 7 % gel was scanned using the Typhoon 9400 and the ﬂ  uorescence intensity volumes were esti-mated with the DeCyder™ Image Analysis Software. After normalization, it appeared that S2 accounted for the observed signal reduction. To conﬁ  rm ﬂ  uorescent signal preservation, we summed the volumes of all 3D spots for each condition and compared them to the corresponding spot volumes on 2D gel. These results show the relative conservation of total ﬂ  uorescence and global variation (average volume ratio: −1.87 for 2D gel and −1.67 for 3D gel). The minor difference can be explained by a loss of material due to the fact that: (a) only the cylinder surrounding the top of the peak of 2D spot was picked; (b) after the 3D run, quantiﬁ  cation does not include small smears into the spot volume estimation. An Anova test with  p -value < 0.05 was realized with SAS

437   3.    The gel fragments corresponding to the same spot position in the 2D-DIGE gels (control and treated) are positioned next to each other.      4.    Add 10 μL of the following mix: 2.5 μL of 4× NuPage LDS sample buffer, 1 μL 1 M SDS, 6.5 μL water.      5.    Using the XCell SureLock™ Mini-Cell, run the gel ﬁ  rst at 50 V constant for 1 h and then follow the manufacturer’s instruc-tions ( see   Note 6  ).      6.    Remove the gel from the plastic cassette.      7.    Acquire the gel image using the Typhoon 9400.      8.    Use the Decyder software for a quantitative analysis of the gel image (ﬂ  uorescence volumetric reading). The data set can be analyzed using standard statistical software. Figure  2  shows the results of such an analysis.             1.    Run a preparative 2D-DIGE gel as described above ( see   Note 7  ).      2.    Use the data from the 2D-DIGE analytical gel analysis to locate spots of interest in the preparative 2D-DIGE gel.
3.    Generate a new picking list to command the mechanical spot picker.      4.    Treat the excised spots as described in Subheading  3.2.4   up to  step 6  .      5.    Attach the gel to a cellophane backing ( see   Note 8  ).      6.    Acquire the gel image using the Typhoon 9400.      7.    Generate a new picking list to command the mechanical spot picker.      8.    Proceed with the MS analysis protocol.        Our protocol was initially used to detect low abundant proteins such as SUMO target proteins ( see  Fig.  3 ).     1.    Run a preparative 2D-DIGE as described above.      2.    Scan the 2D-DIGE gel (Typhoon 9400).      3.    Load the gel onto the electro-blotting transfer apparatus and transfer proteins to a low-ﬂ  uorescent (PVDF) membrane according to the manufacturers’ literature.      4.    Scan the PVDF membrane (Typhoon 9400).      5.    Block the membrane with ECL blocking agent.
6.    Probe the PVDF membrane with primary antibody against SUMO1 and then with the appropriate secondary antibody coupled to Cy5.      7.    Scan the PVDF membrane.   3.3  MS Protein Identiﬁ  cation3.4  Western Blot Analysis3D Differential Electrophoresis
438   8.    Use the 2D-DIGE gel and PVDF images to create a picking list.      9.    Run a new preparative 2D-DIGE gel and excise the spots accor-ding to the picking list.      10.    Fractionate the protein content of these gel fragments as in Subheading  3.2.4  .      11.    Scan the gel to visualize the individual proteic components.      12.    Perform a new Western blot ( steps 3  – 6 ) to detect SUMO conjugate.      13.    For the MS identiﬁ  cation of the SUMO targets duplicate the gel (go to  step 9  ).    4       Notes      1.    Our protocol requires in-gel protein detection without ﬁ  xa-tion. Although several methods that fulﬁ  ll that requirement are available [ 18 ,  19 ], we described a DIGE-based procedure which combines high-sensitivity protein detection and differ-ential protein expression analysis.  Two procedures for protein labeling are available for DIGE application. In the minimal labeling procedure two protein
samples and the internal standard are separately labeled with the spectrally resolvable cyanine dyes Cy2, Cy3 or Cy5 and mixed before electrophoretic fractionation. The minimal label-ing ﬂ uorophors contain a  N -hydroxysuccinimidyl ester reactive   Fig. 3    3D-DIGE-based detection and identiﬁ  cation of low-abundance proteins. 2D Western blot analysis of control leaves’ protein extracts was performed with a polyclonal antibody against SUMO1 protein (Primary antibody, dilution 1/800; secondary antibody, dilution 1/2,000). Over 70 SUMO-protein conjugate spots were detected. One of these spots ( a ) was excised and re-electrophoresed in a Bis-Tris Glycine 4–12 % gel.

439group that reacts with the ε-amino groups of lysine residues in proteins. The coupling conditions have been optimized to ensure that only a single lysine on each protein is coupled to the CyDye. In the protocol for Scarce Samples, only two dyes Cy3 and Cy5 are supplied with a thiol maleimide group that will react with every cystein residue in a protein.      2.    The leaf proteins was extracted as described in [ 20 ] and resus-pended in the rehydration buffer. The protein concentration should be ≥0.55 mg/mL. A maximum of 120 μL containing 300 μg protein can be loaded in the loading sample cup.      3.    If necessary the pH of the protein extract should be adjusted at pH 8.0 with 50 mM NaOH or 50 mM HCl.      4.    The exact volume of the TCEP solution should be optimized for each experiment to ensure complete reduction of the cysteine–cysteine disulﬁ  de bonds in proteins.  As for the case of TCEP, the exact volume of the CyDye
DIGE Fluor solution should be optimized for each experiment.      5.    If the strip was stored at −80 °C, allow the strip to equilibrate at room temperature.      6.

Bead-based multiplexed assays can be performed with hundreds of samples, thereby enabling time-resolved pathway activities of stimulated or perturbed cells. The data can be used to infer the structure of underlying signaling networks. Protein array technology is well-suited for such investiga-tions because it can simultaneously measure many different proteins as well as entails minimal amounts of material [ 1 – 4 ].  Over the past decade, bead-based arrays have become  well- established in cell signaling research (Fig.  1 ). This technology platform has been used to analyze signaling networks in a time-
resolved manner. The polystyrene beads have an internal ﬂ  uores-cent color code that facilitates the measurement of up to 500 features. The surface coating includes paramagnetic material and carboxyl groups that allow easy conjugation of proteins, peptides, oligonucleotides, and carbohydrates. For a panel of sandwich immunoassays, the beads are usually coated with different capture
442antibodies. Following incubation with a protein extract from tissue or cell culture, the captured analytes are detected and quantiﬁ  ed by means of detection antibodies in a sandwich mode.   Since protein activity in signaling networks is often reﬂ  ected by transient phosphorylation, it is important to not only quantify the total amount of a signaling protein but also its various molecular forms. Antibodies speciﬁ  c to posttranslational modiﬁ  ed sequences are used to capture analytes, making the bead-based array platform an appropriate tool for simultaneous monitoring the various types of phosphorylation of a single protein [ 4 ,  5 ]. In our assay, different states and functions of β-catenin are monitored under various treatment conditions in a time-dependent manner. β-Catenin plays a key role in the canonical Wnt-signaling pathway and in  cell-to- cell adhesion complexes. Its cellular functions, whether
transcription factor or cell adhesion molecule, are orchestrated by   Fig. 1    The β-catenin bead array panel employs antibodies and known interaction partners of β-catenin to study the phosphorylation status and its complexation status within the same multiplex assay system. Differentially phosphorylated β-catenin is measured with bead array-based sandwich immunoassays. By uti-lizing different phosphorylation state and sequence-speciﬁ  c antibodies and a single pan-speciﬁ  c antibody serving as the capture molecule, it is possible to reliably discriminate and detect various phosphorylated β-catenin forms. The recombinantly expressed binding partners of β-catenin, ECT (E-cadherin cytosolic tail), ICAT (inhibitor of β-catenin), and TCF4 (T-cell factor 4) are used as bait proteins in a protein–protein interaction assay for binding and detecting transcriptionally active β-catenin. The miniaturized co-immunoprecipitation
(μCoip) allows β-catenin in complex with E-cadherin to be detected by ﬁ  shing E-cadherin. In all assay set-ups, the same antibody speciﬁ  c for the β-catenin C-terminus is used as a detector       EcadBaitSandwich immunoassay    Assay type  Assay set-upProtein-protein interaction                assay           µCoipNCBead1-6Bead7-9PEBead10NCCapture antibody/bait proteinAnalyteDetector antibody anti β-catenin (c-term specific)phosphorylated and totalβ-catenin transcriptionally active     „free“ β-catenin   E-cadherin-bound β-catenin anti-non pSer33Ser37Thr41anti-pSer33Ser37Thr41anti-pSer45anti-pSer552anti-pSer675anti-pan β-catenin GST-TCF4GST-ICATGST-ECTms E-cadherinNCPE PEDetection system anti-mouse-PE conjugate Nicola Groll et al.
443changes in concentration, phosphorylation and complexation asso-ciated with other factors such as cadherins. After activation of the Wnt receptor, a free pool of β-catenin accumulates in the cyto-plasm, translocates into the nucleus and then functions as a tran-scriptional co-activator [ 6 ,  7 ].  The Wnt/ β-catenin signaling pathway plays an important role in the regeneration of adult tissues and in embryonic development [ 8 ]. Being a proto-oncogene, β-catenin is a key factor in carcino-genesis. Mutations in the β-catenin gene or in other genes involved in β-catenin regulation, such as APC or Axin, lead to hyperactiva-tion of the Wnt signaling pathway and are implicated in the genesis of common cancers, such as colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma [ 9 – 11 ]. Wnt/ β-catenin signaling also impacts the epi-thelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is reportedly involved in the invasion of tissue and formation of metastasis [ 12 ].
Here, we propose a protocol using three different assay set-ups—sandwich immunoassays, protein–protein interaction and μco-immunoprecipitations—in one panel to assess and quantify β-catenin, its phosphorylation and functional mode in a single sample. The sandwich immunoassay allows the measurement of total β-catenin as well as the degree of phosphorylation at six dif-ferent sites. For this purpose, one pan- speciﬁ  c β-catenin antibody, one de-phosphorylation and four phosphorylation-speciﬁ  c anti-bodies served as capture molecules. Thus discrimination and detec-tion of non-phosphorylated, differentially phosphorylated and total β-catenin is carried out.  In miniaturized GST-pull down ( μGST pull down) assays,  cellular interaction partners of β-catenin are used as baits to detect β-catenin in its “free” non-complexed form. The β-catenin which forms a complex with these baits is transcriptionally active, as previ-ously described [ 4 ].
ously described [ 4 ].  A capture antibody toward E-cadherin allows μco- immuno-precipitation of the E-cadherin/ β-catenin complex [ 13 ]. This mem-brane complex reﬂ  ects the integrity of the cell. Finally, all the analytes are detected by an antibody which binds to the C-terminal region of β-catenin and a phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody. This enables a readout of the various assays and allows the different pools and states of β-catenin to be monitored at the same time.  2    Materials       1.

To conjugate proteins directly on the magnetic beads, we used EDC/NHS to generate succinimidyl ester deriving from the car-boxyl functions of the microsphere surface. The chemical reaction with protein amino groups results in the formation of amide bonds. Buffer agents containing primary or secondary amino groups like glycine or stabilizing agents like BSA should be avoided since they compete with the antibodies for the activated carboxyl groups.
If the buffer formulation contains components carrying amino groups, site-directed non-covalent strategies can be applied, such as epitope tag or species-speciﬁ  c antibodies to immobilize recombinant proteins and antibodies in a site-speciﬁ  c manner ( see   Notes 3  – 5 ).  In our study, we used GST-speciﬁ  c antibodies to immobilize recombinant fusion proteins and rabbit-speciﬁ  c antibodies to immo-bilize the phosphorylation- and sequence-speciﬁ  c antibodies.       1.    Sonicate selected beads stock and transfer 200 μl (2.5 × 10 6  beads) of each bead stock solution (1.25 × 10 7  beads/ml) to 1.5 ml reaction tubes (polypropylene, clear).      2.    Use a magnetic separator to collect the beads ( see   Note 6  ).      3.    Remove the supernatant with a pipette and wash beads twice with 200 μl of activation buffer. Collect the beads by means of the magnetic separator in between washes.      4.    Re-suspend beads in 80 μl of activation buffer.
5.    Prepare NHS and EDC solutions immediately before use. Add 10 μl of each solution to the bead suspension and incubate for 20 min at room temperature, in the dark, under rotation to activate the beads.      6.    Use the magnetic separator to collect the beads, discard the activation solution.      7.    Wash the beads three times with 500 μl of coupling buffer.

448cadherin antibodies to 80 μg/ml; anti-rabbit IgG antibody to 250 μg/ml.      9.    Add 250 μl of the diluted protein solution to the beads and incubate at room temperature, in the dark, for at least 2 h under rotation.      10.    Place the tubes in a magnetic separator to collect the beads. Remove the supernatant and discard.      11.    Wash the beads three times with 500 μl of washing buffer. Collect the beads by using the magnetic separator between washes ( see   Note 6  ).      12.    Re-suspend the coupled beads in 100 μl storage buffer.      13.    Store beads in the dark at 4 °C.      The bead recovery should be determined as follows:    1.    Dilute the covalently coupled beads 1:500 in the assay buffer.      2.    Transfer 100 μl/well of diluted beads to a microtiter plate and incubate the diluted beads for 30 min in a 96-well plate shaker, rotating at 750 rpm at room temperature.      3.    Measure the numbers of beads with a Luminex reader using
the following settings:  Sample size  50 μl  Time-out  80 s  Total beads  10,000    Calculate the bead concentration as follows:  Beads per μl = (number of beads/30 μl) × 500        If it is not possible to couple proteins directly to the carboxy- modiﬁ  ed beads, due to unfavorable additives such as glycine, sodium azide, BSA, carrier proteins or low protein concentration, it is recommended to use a non-covalent immobilization strategy. In this case, it is advis-able to use tag- or species-speciﬁ  c antibody- conjugated beads. Here, we used this strategy to immobilize antibodies against phosphorylated β-catenin or GST-tagged bait proteins. To ensure the removal of all unbound bait molecules that could possibly interfere with the sample or other assay components, several washing steps are necessary.    1.    Dilute GST-tagged bait protein (2.5 μg of each protein) ( see   Note 7  ) with 50 μl PBS in separate 1.5 ml tubes (polypropyl-
ene, clear). Incubate in the presence of 10 5  beads coupled to the antibody that recognizes GST for 6 h at room temperature, under rotation.      2.    Dilute phosphorylation-speciﬁ  c β-catenin antibodies (250 ng) with 50 μl PBS in separate 1.5 ml tubes (polypropylene, clear). 3.2.2  Non-covalent Coupling of Capture Antibodies and Bait Proteins to MicrospheresNicola Groll et al.
449Incubate in the presence of 10 5  beads coupled to the antibody rabbit IgG in 50 μl PBS for 4 h at room temperature, under rotation.      3.    Place the tubes in a magnetic separator to collect the beads. Remove the supernatant and discard it.      4.    Wash each bead population three times with 200 μl PBS by using a magnetic separator ( see   Note 6  ).      5.    Re-suspend each bead population in 50 μl bead assay buffer.      6.    The beads cannot be stored and should be used directly in the assay.         Before carrying out the assay procedure, the protein extracts need to be normalized to protein concentration. Due to the cell type and the quantity of the target protein (in this case: β-catenin) being proportional to total protein, it is advisable to determine the optimal amounts in separate, preliminary experiments. We suggest that a dilution series of cell culture lysates is made to iden-tify a suitable range of lysate amounts for detecting the target
proteins. We  recommend using 10–25 μg of total protein, as this is usually appropriate for analyses ( see   Note 8  ).  Here we describe how the assay can be performed by using a magnetic bead transfer system ([ 14 ] King Fisher, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁ  c) which enables semi-automated washing and incubation steps. Of course, it is also possible to use a magnetic plate separator for manual washing and incubation in a 96-well plate.    1.    Prepare a bead-master mix by diluting each population of coated beads in assay buffer in order to ensure that there are 2,000 beads for each population in 20 μl of fully mixed bead solution. Vortex the diluted beads to mix them.      2.    Choose an appropriate protein amount of each sample, and adjust each sample to the same protein concentration with assay buffer at a volume of 40 μl. Keep the samples on ice.      3.    Combine 20 μl bead mix with 40 μl of diluted cell sample in
one well of the 96-well microplate (half-area, ﬂ  at-bottomed microplate, with a non-binding surface, is subsequently referred to as the assay plate).      4.

4514            Notes      1.    Growth rate depends considerably on cell line and incubation parameters.      2.    The purpose of the assay described here is to examine a  molecular snapshot of a single protein. The conditions were optimized, in particular for extracting the native β-catenin and its diverse forms as well as the intact E-cadherin complexes. Generally, the extraction conditions, for instance, those includ-ing additives of the lysis buffer, can inﬂ  uence the native pro-tein. It is thus necessary to optimize the appropriate detergent, salt concentration and inhibitors if other proteins or pathways shall be analyzed.

It is important to ensure that reagents such as glycine, BSA, etc. are not present in the capture antibody formulation as they prevent or reduce capture antibody coupling efﬁ  ciency.      4.    In a bead-based sandwich immunoassay system, only a limited number of proteins can be analyzed simultaneously (typically <25). Due to cross-reactions, the increasing number of detec-tion antibodies in the system usually results in higher back-ground  signals. It is therefore recommended that bead-based
assays are used for focused analysis with up to 25 analytes.  One of the most restricting factors is availability of anti-bodies required. Two antibodies are usually necessary for every analyte: one for capture, the other for detection. They must bind to two different epitopes of the targeted analyte.      5.    As a rule, the assays are designed to analyze the native form of proteins. Therefore, antibodies must be chosen according to their ability to recognize native proteins.      6.    Do not allow beads to dry. Vortex beads thoroughly during each washing or mixing step. To ensure that all the beads are collected, use the collector for 30 s; check whether the beads are deposed on the wall and whether the liquid is clear.      7.    GST-ECT, GST-TCF4, and GST-ICAT were expressed in  Escherichia coli   and afﬁ  nity-puriﬁ  ed as described earlier [ 4 ].      8.    Wide differences in results can occur, depending on the cell line
models. Here, the targeted protein β-catenin can be mutated and/or truncated. For example, HepG2 cells express a mutant form of β-catenin, which is transcriptionally active, because the regulatory N-terminal site is deleted. High amounts of this active form can be detected via the protein–protein interaction proposed here. Therefore it is advisable to use a positive con-trol, to ensure that the assay functions accurately and that assay results can be properly compared. We recommend that extracts should only be taken from cell lines in which the pathway or the targeted protein is known to be present and can be easily acti-vated, e.g. HEK 293 [ 4 ]. An additional advantage of positive controls is that they are helpful in identifying technical prob-lems, e.g. batch-to-batch variations of r eagents. For the same reason, we recommend blank contr ols for detect ing batch-to- batch variations of reagents.            References Nicola Groll et al.

Applications of func-tional protein microarrays range from the identiﬁ  cation of protein- binding properties, to surveying targets of posttranslational modiﬁ  cations, to uncovering novel enzymatic activities. Since the development of the yeast proteome microarray over 10 years ago
[ 1 ], more recent work has seen the development of complete and near-complete proteome arrays representing viruses, bacteria, and plants [ 2 – 4 ]. However, most existing human protein microarrays are comprised of only a minority of the human proteome [ 5 – 9 ]. We have recently developed a human proteome microarray, the HuProt array, which includes nearly 20,000 full-length human proteins [ 10 ]. The proteins used to generate this microarray were expressed in yeast and puriﬁ  ed under native conditions.
456Expressing recombinant eukaryotic proteins in yeast improves the likelihood that proteins will retain their biological activity relative to prokaryotic and in vitro expression systems.  Numerous collaborations between our labs and others have so far harnessed the power of the HuProt array to proﬁ  le a wide range of protein activities. The role of posttranslational modiﬁ  cations in regulating enzymatic activity is one area of investigation particu-larly well suited for the HuProt array platform. A screen to deﬁ  ne the S-nitrosylated proteome revealed an important regulatory role for this posttranslational modiﬁ  cation in the control of ubiquitin E3 ligase activity [ 11 ]. In other work, phosphorylation and glyco-sylation states of the protein kinase CK2 were shown to affect its substrate speciﬁ  city [ 12 ]. The HuProt array has also been used in two separate studies to link novel protein–RNA interactions to
neurological disease, including an interaction between RNA splic-ing factors and a long noncoding RNA linked to schizophrenia [ 13 ] and an interaction between multiple RNA binding proteins and an expanded repeat-containing transcript implicated in amyo-trophic lateral sclerosis [ 14 ]. Another ongoing project in our labs is the generation of monospeciﬁ  c monoclonal antibodies whose speciﬁ  city can be quickly evaluated using the HuProt array [ 10 ]. The utility of the HuProt array further extends to exciting clinical applications including the identiﬁ  cation of novel biomarkers that may be used as a diagnostic tool in primary biliary cirrhosis, an autoimmune disease of the liver [ 15 ].  Protein SUMOylation is an essential posttranslational modiﬁ  -cation in most organisms, including yeast,  C. elegans  , Arabidopsis, and mice [ 16 ]. The reversible SUMO-modiﬁ  cation of target pro-teins involves an enzymatic cascade chemically similar to ubiquity-
lation, involving E1 activating, E2 conjugating, E3 ligating enzymes and SUMO proteases. As the only classes of SUMOylation enzymes for which multiple members have been identiﬁ  ed, the SUMO E3 ligases and the SUMO proteases have been proposed to be the major factors determining substrate speciﬁ  city. Recently, we have conducted SUMOylation assays using the HuProt micro-array to identify numerous previously uncharacterized SUMO E3 ligase-dependent substrates using a subset of human SUMO E3 ligases. While our study focused on some of the best characterized SUMO E3 ligases, recently additional SUMO E3 ligases have been described [ 17 – 21 ] and it is likely that new SUMO E3 ligases await discovery [ 22 ]. The methods that we describe here could be used to identify substrates for these additional SUMO E3 ligases. For most SUMO E3 ligases, only a limited number of substrates are known. In this chapter, we will describe the on-chip SUMOylation
protocol that we have developed so that the reader may conduct SUMOylation assays using the HuProt microarray with their SUMO E3 ligase of interest.  Eric Cox et al.

Add E1 and E2 enzymes and E3 ligase immediately before the end of the blocking step. Set up two control experiments, one using anti-body only, and one without the E3 ligase.      5.    Remove one array from blocking buffer and carefully wick off liquid by tapping the edge on a paper towel, give the bottom of the array a quick wipe with a kimwipe and place array on the top surface (protein side up) of a humidity chamber ( see   Note 4  ).      6.    Add SUMO reaction mix to each slide carefully and place lift-erslip on top, being careful to avoid bubbles ( see   Note 5  ).      7.    Incubate at 37 °C for 90 min (depending on enzyme activity).      8.    Immediately after start of incubation, pre-warm appropriate vol-ume of 1 % SDS to 55 °C for later washing steps ( see   Note 6  ).
9.    Remove coverslip by gently sliding off array ( see   Note 7  ).      10.    Place arrays in a four-well plate and wash gently on orbital shaker 3× for 10 min at room temperature with 3 ml TBST per well.      11.    Wash with 1 % SDS warmed to 55 °C 3× for 5 min each.      12.    Wash once with 3 ml TBST.      13.    Dilute labeled SUMO1 antibody in blocking buffer at 1:1,000 dilution. Apply 200 μl of the antibody mixture to each array and add fresh coverslip. Incubate array with labeled SUMO1 antibody for 1 h at room temperature.      14.    Remove coverslip by gently sliding off array and wash slides three times for 10 min in 3 ml TBST in four-well plate.      15.    Wash the slides once in 50–100 ml milliQ water for 5 min to remove residual salts from the surface of the microarray ( see   Note 8  ).      16.    Place each array horizontally into a micro slide box with kim-
wipes on the bottom. Centrifuge the box in a benchtop centri-fuge for 3 min at 500 ×  g .      17.    Scan the microarray with a GenePix 4000B scanner with 5- μm resolution detection at 532 nm with the appropriate gain and power settings ( see   Note 9  ). Save the scanned images as TIFF ﬁ les. All slides that will be compared should be scanned using the same gain and power settings.       4    Notes      1.    The humidity chamber is made by placing a folded paper towel in the bottom of an empty pipette tip box (we usually use a USA scientiﬁ  c stacked rack made for 200 μl tips, e.g., #1111- 1206), adding 1 in. of ddH 2 O, and replacing the tip holder on Identifying SUMO Substrates Using the HuProt Microarray
462the box. The arrays will sit on the tip holder and be covered with the lid to maintain a humid environment.      2.    SUMOylation of many proteins occurs in the absence of E3 ligases at relatively high E1 and E2 concentrations; therefore E1 and E2 concentrations are usually used in the low end of this range when using an E3 ligase. However, it is advisable to establish the best SUMOylation conditions using a conven-tional tube-based assay, particularly E1 and E2 concentrations, with the SUMO E3 ligase of interest and a known substrate. The best result will allow clear visualization of enhanced SUMOylation in the presence of the E3 ligase, before pro-ceeding with the assay on-chip.      3.    To minimize evaporation and potential photobleaching of any ﬂ uorescently labeled protein beacons included on the protein microarray, it is advised to wrap four-well plate with a layer of saran wrap, then a layer of aluminum foil, before overnight incubation.
4.    It is critical to strike the right balance of removing excess liquid from the array while not over-drying at this step. The goal is to remove enough liquid so as not to dilute the reaction mix, while also not allowing the top (protein surface) to not become completely dry. The best results can be obtained by being ready to add reaction mix immediately, i.e., reaction mix tube open, pipet set to correct volume and already loaded with a pipet tip, after placing the chip on the surface of the tip holder.      5.    Ensure that bubbles are pushed out of the reaction mix while adding coverslip to the top surface of the array. One reliable strategy is to ﬁ  rst rest one end of the coverslip on the edge of the array, then gradually lower the other end of the coverslip to push out the bubbles.      6.    1 % SDS is used in order to stringently wash the array and remove any non-covalently bound SUMO from the arrayed proteins.
7.    Removing the coverslip is best achieved by gently sliding the coverslip straight along the array with only the raised edges of the coverslip contacting the outside edges of the chip, where no proteins are printed. Allowing the raised edges of the cov-erslip to move across the array (contacting the region where proteins are printed) can scratch the surface of the chip, caus-ing high background signal in the scratched region, resulting in lost information about proteins in the path of the scratch.      8.    A wash with high purity water is essential to remove residual salts that can result in high background when scanning.      9.    To get the most meaningful information from your protein microarray experiment, it is important to scan the chip with the appropriate gain and power settings. A useful starting point using GenePix software would be PMT Gain = 600, Power = 100 %. Usually the gain value can then be raised or Eric Cox et al.
463lowered depending on the resulting image obtained at these settings. Generally, it is desired to have the highest signal inten-sity values possible while avoiding signal saturation of impor-tant features.            References     1.

player in the development or progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other pathologies associated with formation of protein aggregates in the central nervous system [ 1 – 6 ]. Although much attention is paid to formation of extracellular amyloid plaques and protein aggregates as well as to corresponding mechanisms of their toxicity, good evidence exists that intracellular amyloid- beta can accumulate intraneuronally and contribute to disease progression [ 4 ,  7 – 13 ]. This suggests importance of amyloid- beta interaction with particular intracellular targets. Indeed, interaction of amy-loid-beta with intracellular catalase caused inactivation of this enzyme and accumulation of hydrogen peroxide inside cells [ 14 ].
466This implies that oxidative stress induced in the cells exposed to amyloid-beta may be (at least partially) associated with reduced degradation of intracellular hydrogen peroxide [ 14 ].  In the cell amyloid-beta was found in different intracellular compartments [ 4 ]. The latter suggests possibility of amyloid inter-action with a broad range of proteins, which may be thus denomi-nated as amyloid-beta-binding proteins. Although there are reports on the interaction of amyloid-beta peptide with various intracellu-lar proteins [ 14 ,  15 ] and development of protocols for afﬁ  nity iso-lation of amyloid-beta-binding proteins [ 16 ], the afﬁ  nity-based proteomic proﬁ  ling of brain proteins interacting with immobilized amyloid-beta, their identiﬁ  cation has not been performed yet.  Here we describe a protocol for afﬁ  nity-based proﬁ  ling of amyloid- beta-binding proteins of rat brain, their proteomic identi-
ﬁ cation and validation by a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based analysis. It includes several interrelated blocks (Fig.  1 ):     (a)    SPR-based selection of immobilization conditions for amyloid- beta coupling and choice of appropriate resin for preparation of an afﬁ  nity sorbent.      (b)    Immobilization of amyloid-beta on the selected resin.      (c)    Preparation of biological samples (rat brain homogenate) for afﬁ nity-based separation.

Most fre-quently, afﬁ  nity-based sorbents are prepared using cyanogen bro-mide (CNBr)-activated Sepharose [ 16 ]. In this case CNBr-activated Sepharose coupling of ligands of interest occurs under alkaline condition via their amino groups. However, in alkaline conditions the beta-amyloid peptide (1–42) readily aggregates [ 17 ]. Taking into consideration our SPR-based data on poor immobilization of beta-amyloid peptide (1–42) on the optical biosensor chip surface at pH 4.0 (Fig.  2 ), it appears that CNBr-activated Sepharose is
inapplicable for covalent immobilization of the monomeric form of this peptide ( see   Note 1  ). Thus, we have chosen Afﬁ  -Gel 10 as an alternative resin due to possibility of covalent immobilization under a broad range of pH values.  2.5  LC-MS and Data Evaluation3.1  SPR-Based Selection of Immobilization Conditions for Beta-Amyloid CouplingProteomic Proﬁ  ling of Amyloid-Binding Proteins

475  Further validation of the interaction between immobilized amyloid- beta and proteins identiﬁ  ed by mass spectrometry can be obtained using various methods. We recommend the SPR-based biosensor analysis with puriﬁ  ed proteins of interest ( see  Figs.  1  and  2 ). Advantages of the SPR-based validation consist in the possibility of repeated use of the optical biosensor cuvette with immobilized amyloid-beta.   4    Notes      1.    Recent results of isoelectric focusing studies indicate that low molecular forms of monomeric amyloid-beta (1–42 and 1–40) are characterized by a p I  value of ca. 5, while at p I  of 6–6.5 aggregates of high molecular weight are detected [ 17 ]. This suggests that it is better to use more acidic solutions of amyloid- beta to prevent its aggregation.      2.    Several studies have recognized glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the amyloid-binding protein (e.g., [ 18 ,  21 ]),
and therefore it can be used as a probe for interaction with immobilized amyloid-beta.      3.    Various intracellular highly abundant proteins (e.g., cytokera-tins) may nonspeciﬁ  cally bind to a resin even without an immo-bilized afﬁ  nity sorbent ( see  for example, ref.  22 ) and therefore a control batch of the ligand-free sorbent has to be subjected to all the same treatments but without amyloid-beta. The list of identiﬁ  ed amyloid-binding proteins will have to be cor-rected for possible presence of proteins nonspeciﬁ  cally bound to the control sorbent.      4.    Use sequencing grade trypsin only for mass spectrometry experiments due to its high speciﬁ  city and low contamination of alpha-chymotrypsin. Also it is strongly recommended to use modiﬁ  ed trypsin (with acetylated lysins) to prolong activity of enzyme and slow down its autolysis.      5.    In the case of the use of non-sequencing grade trypsin its cata-
lytic activity may be rather low; if so, it is recommended to add up to 0.003 M of calcium chloride to increase ionic strength of reaction mixture rather than sodium salts to minimize further cationization during LC-MS analysis. However, it should be noted that native trypsin may undergo autolysis, generating pseudotrypsin, which exhibits a broadened substrate speciﬁ  city including chymotrypsin-like activity ( see  comments [ 23 ]). In addition, trypsin may be contaminated with chymotrypsin, and this fact has to be taken into consideration especially when high enzyme/substrate ratios are used.         3.9  SPR-Based Validation of the Interaction of Identiﬁ  ed Proteins with Amyloid-  BetaProteomic Proﬁ  ling of Amyloid-Binding Proteins

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS)-based proteomics has recently become one of the most informative and attractive core technologies in proteomics. Particularly, nanomaterials-based MALDI
mass spectrometric methods are quickly becoming a critical miniaturized bioanalytical tool for detecting and discerning proteins from biocomplex samples. These MALDI-developed strategies allow high-throughput identiﬁ  cation of proteins from highly complex mixtures including accurate mass measure-ment of peptides derived from total proteome digests and peptides/proteins separations from various samples. The nanomaterials- integrated MALDI-MS technologies in protein arrays hold much promise for interrogating the diverse and immense proteome in cell biology. As a result, nanomaterials-assisted MALDI-MS-based proteomic workﬂ  ow, including sample preparation, information on the local molec-ular composition, relative abundance and spatial distribution of peptides and proteins and their analysis, should make the technology more easily available to a broad community and turn it into a powerful methodology for bioanalysts.

Mass spec-trometry has become the bioanalytical technique for proteome analyses, which has the ability to probe the covalent structure of proteins. Among the mass spectrometric-based proteomics, MALDI-MS- based proteomics is mature and an attractive technol-ogy for characterization and quantiﬁ  cation of proteins in a biologi-cal sample or system [ 1 ]. Although MALDI-MS has been known as a powerful bioanalytical technique for protein analysis, it still
480faces signiﬁ  cant challenges for complicated proteome research in large scale due to large proportions of protein biomarkers exist in extremely low abundances and thus require tedious sample pre-treatment to trace the speciﬁ  c proteins [ 2 ,  3 ]. The successful detec-tion of ultratrace biomolecules depends mostly on sample pretreatment. In the last three decades, the biomolecular mass spectrometric capabilities have been dramatically extended by the development of nanomaterials- based MALDI-MS approaches for biomolecules proﬁ  ling in biocomplex samples [ 3 ]. This has led to many MALDI-MS methodologies to be developed for proteome research, with unique capabilities of speciﬁ  city, sensitivity, speed, and sampling with minimal volumes. Nanomaterials-based MALDI-MS have greatly enhanced the analytical dynamic range and limit of detection for biomolecules (proteins and peptides) proﬁ ling in biocomplex samples (plasma, serum, other bodily ﬂ  u-
ids, or tissue) [ 1 – 3 ]. In MALDI-MS-based proteomics, nanomate-rials exhibit as multifunctional roles such as matrices, and afﬁ  nity/concentrating probes for isolation and enrichment of ultratrace target biomolecules prior to their identiﬁ  cation [ 4 ]. As a result, the workﬂ  ow splits into three directions: (1) analysis of biomolecules (peptides and large proteins) for reduced background noises, high resolution and accuracy, (2) enrichment of tryptic digest products, and (3) extraction and preconcentration proteins in biosamples.   The unique optical and physico-chemical properties of nanomate-rials have been explored to be used as matrices for analysis of pep-tides and proteins with high mass accuracy and reduced background signals because nanomaterials act as functional probes for genera-tion of biomolecular mass spectra which produce better mass spec-tra than the conventional organic matrices [ 2 ]. The small nature
and unique physico-chemical properties of nanomaterials allow them to enter/cross cellular membranes and their high surface area to volume ratio provides a possibility to trap trace analytes with high degree from complex samples. Furthermore, nanostructures acted as good candidates to absorb incoming laser radiation and to transfer the absorbed energy to the analytes, promoting their desorption with high mass accuracy and with reduced background noises, and eliminating the need for the organic matrix. Due to the high dispersion ability of nanomaterials, nanomaterials-conjugated analytes are efﬁ  ciently and readily transferred between instruments, which allow to detect ultratrace biomolecules with minimal sample loss. A wide variety of nanomaterials including carbon-based nano-structures (carbon nanotubes, graphite, graphene), metallic (Au, Ag, and Pt NPs), metal oxides (TiO 2 , ZnO, SiO 2 , Fe 3 O 4 , and ZrO 2 ), and semiconductor (ZnS, CdS, CdTe, and HgTe, etc.)
nanoparticles have been used as matrices for the analysis of biomol-ecules by MALDI-MS with good accuracy and high mass resolu-tion [ 2 ,  5 – 7 ]. Due to their strong UV absorption cross-section of 1.1  Nanomaterials as MatricesSuresh Kumar Kailasa and Hui-Fen Wu
481nanomaterials, they acted as energy mediators for transferring adsorbed energy to desorb and ionize surface ligands (analytes), resulting in producing clean biomolecular mass spectra with high mass sensitivity, resolution, and accuracy.    In general, the bottom-up method has been widely accepted for the routine identiﬁ  cation of proteins in complex mixtures. In the bottom up approach, proteins are quantiﬁ  ed that can provide a direct indication of the up-regulation or down-regulation of the genes. Bottom-up-based MALDI-MS approaches involve the anal-ysis of protein sequences from the protein digests (enzymatically or chemically digesting proteins into small peptides). In comprehen-sive proteomics, separation and enrichment of low abundance pep-tides from very complex samples are challenging tasks for bioanalysts [ 8 ]. Although not yet at the levels of data throughput and automa-tion achieved in other genomic analyses such as DNA sequencing
or microarray gene expression analysis, global protein proﬁ  ling methods are rapidly evolving. However, it can be possible because of recent improvements in MS instrumentation, protein and pep-tide separation techniques, computational data, and the availability of complete sequence databases for many species. To meet short- gun proteomics, many efforts have been devoted on the combina-tion of protein digestion, MS and MS/MS approaches for the identiﬁ  cation of protein sequence [ 8 ,  9 ]. Although these direct MALDI-MS-based proteomics allow to analyze protein sequence in protein mixtures, unfortunately, proteome analysis is not straightforward due to the following reasons. First, the stoichiom-etry of target proteins is relatively difﬁ  cult to know. Second, the MS-based analytical techniques have a limited dynamic range for the identiﬁ  cation of minor sites in the target proteins. Third, repet-itive sample transfers cause loss of peptides, yielding a low sequence
coverage for database searching with less conﬁ  dent protein identi-ﬁ cation. To solve these problems, various nanomaterials (metal NPs, metal oxides, metal sulﬁ  des, and tellurides) have been used as probes to speed up proteolysis and to capture the digested proteins from biocomplex samples prior to their identiﬁ  cation by MALDI-MS with high degree of protein sequences [ 10 ,  11 ].    Recent trends in MALDI-MS-based proteomics have been inten-sively focused on the improvement in quality of mass spectra of target proteins, introduction of new technological developments with MALDI-MS and especially in miniaturization, simpliﬁ  cation, and automation of the whole analytical procedure, to extract and concentrate trace proteins in microvolume samples [ 12 ,  13 ]. Prior to the identiﬁ  cation of target proteins/peptides by MALDI-MS, sample preparation step is essentially required to isolate them from the sample matrix, and to enrich them to a concentration level
detectable by MALDI-MS. To achieve the objective, substantial 1.2  Nanomaterials as Afﬁ  nity Probes1.3  Nanomaterials as Extracting and Preconcentrating ProbesProteomic Proﬁ  ling by Nanomaterials
482efforts have been made on the integration of nanomaterials in  miniaturization sample-pretreatment procedures (liquid–liquid microextraction (LLME) and single-drop microextraction (SDME)) prior to their identiﬁ  cation by MALDI-MS. Apart from these, nanomaterial-based chips have been developed for isolation and preconcentration of ultratrace biomolecules (peptides and proteins) from various sample matrices prior to MALDI-MS analy-sis. These approaches improved the sample preparation perfor-mance, especially addresses the issues of sample and solvent consumption, selectivity and recoveries, and speeding up the sam-ple-treatment process, which is currently considered the bottle-neck of proteome analysis.  In view of the above applications of nanomaterials in MALDI-MS- based proteomics, this chapter is mainly focused on the analy-
sis of proteins by nanomaterials-based MALDI-MS that has been successful in our hands. It also discusses the potential applications of nanomaterials-based MALDI-MS for deriving the protein com-position of protein mixtures, to determine the members of pro-teins in biocomplex samples.   2    Materials and Instrumentation      1.

Ions produced by laser desorption were stabilized during a delayed extraction period of 200 ns before entering the mass analyzer and then acceler-ated through the TOF analyzer. The accelerating voltages existed in the range from +20 to −20 kV. All experiments were performed in a linear ( m/z  > 5,000) and reﬂ  ectron ( m/z  < 5,000) mode of TOF-MS.      7.    The microwave oven has 2,450 MHz frequency and the maxi-mum power is 700 W. A thermocouple probe was used to mea-sure the temperatures of sample solutions prior to and after the microwave experiments.           1.    Quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized by the well described procedures in the literature [ 14 ]. Similarly, the unmodiﬁ  ed gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) were prepared by using NaBH 4  as a reducing agent. After preparation of bare QDs and Au NPs, dopamine dithiocarbamate was attached on the surfaces of
QDs by the described procedures [ 14 ,  15 ]. Brieﬂ  y, 0.549 mM dopamine (104.1 mg), 0.549 mM carbon disulﬁ  de (40 μL), and triethylamine (5 μL) were taken in a 2.0 mL glass vial and sonicated for 5 min at room temperature. The formed dopa-mine dithiocarbamate was added into a 25 mL of nanomateri-als (QDs and Au NPs) and then stirred for 15 min at room temperature. Finally, the product was washed with ethanol to remove reactants and unbound dopamine dithiocarbamate.      2.    Vanillin, ethanol, acetic acid, and 4-aminothiophenol were used for the synthesis of (4-mercaptophenyliminomethyl)-2- methoxyphenol (Schiff base 3). Then, the bare Au NPs dis-persed aqueous solution was added to the toluene solution containing 1.66 mM of 4-mercaptophenyliminomethyl-2- methoxyphenol and the solution was stirred vigorously for 5 h. The Au NP was successfully transferred to the organic phase (toluene), as indicated by the color change from light yellow to dark brown [ 16 ].
dark brown [ 16 ].      3.    400 μL of MPA was transferred into a 250 mL round bottom ﬂ ask containing 15 mL of deionized water. To this, 2 mL of 0.01 M cadmium nitrate was added dropwisely under N 2  pres-sure with constant stirring for 1 h. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 9 by adding ammonium hydroxide solution. 2.5 mL of 0.008 M sodium sulﬁ  de solution was quickly added to the above solution at 96 °C and solution was stirred for 2 h. The obtained clean green-yellowish CdS QDs solution was stored at 4 °C until further use [ 17 ]. Similarly, HgTe nano-structures were prepared according to a previously described procedure [ 7 ].      2.1  Functionalization of NanomaterialsProteomic Proﬁ  ling by Nanomaterials
484      1.    AgNO 3 , Se powders and octadecylamine (ODA), octadecane-thiol (ODT) and 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) were used for the synthesis of functionalized silver selinide nanopar-ticles (Ag 2 Se NPs) [ 18 ]. The formed NPs were washed with ethanol and then dispersed in toluene using an ultrasonicator for further use.      2.    Surface-modiﬁ  ed BaTiO 3  NPs were synthesized according to the literature procedure [ 19 ]. Brieﬂ  y, BaTiO 3  NPs (0.5 g) sur-faces were hydroxylated by reﬂ  uxing with 200 mL of H 2 O 2  for 4 h at 106 °C. The hydroxylated BaTiO 3  NPs were ﬁ  ltered and then washed with deionized water for two times. The hydrox-ylated BaTiO 3  NPs were directly added into 250 mL round bottom ﬂ  ask that contained 50 mL of 50 % (v/v) aqueous alcohol along with 0.5 (w/v) of 12-hydroxy octadecanoic acid (HOA). The reaction mixture was heated at 90 °C under vig-orous stirring for 3 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to
room temperature and HOA-modiﬁ  ed BaTiO 3  NPs were treated with 1 N HCl until the pH became 5–6 in order to agglomerate the nanopowder and to facilitate NPs ﬁ  ltration. The surface- modiﬁ  ed BaTiO 3  NPs were washed with deion-ized water and acetone in sequence, several times. The surface-modiﬁ  ed BaTiO 3  NPs were dried in vacuum oven for 24 h and then dispersed in toluene by ultrasonication for 10 min.         Escherichia coli   (12570) standard culture bacteria were obtained from Bioresource Collection and Research Center, Taiwan. Glassware and media were subjected to autoclave at 15 lbs of pres-sure for 15 min prior to bacteria culture. One colony of  E. coli   was carefully taken up from a freshly prepared 24 h old streak plate cul-ture using a sterile loop. The collected bacteria were cultured on Luria Broth Agar (LBA) plates for 24 h at 37 °C. All microbiologi-cal experiments were performed in a Biosafety Level 1 cabinet [ 19 ].   3    Methods
3    Methods       1.    The stock solutions of peptides (Leu-enk, Met-enk, and HW6) were diluted further for working concentrations. An aliquot 900 μL of the peptide solutions were taken in a 1 mL polyeth-ylene vial and 0.1 M HCl or NaOH was added to control pH of the solution. 100 μL of (0.5–6.0 μM) Mn 2+ -doped ZnS semiconductor nanoparticles solution was added and vortexed for 30 min with speed of 86 ×  g  and then centrifuged the vials at 6,797 ×  g . The sample solutions (1 μL) were pipetted onto a stainless steel target plate and allowed to air-dry for 10 min before the MALDI-MS analysis ([ 20 ],  Note 1  ).   2.2  Preparation of Hydrophobic Nanomaterials2.3  Bacteria Growth3.1  Functionalized Nanomaterials as Matrices for Peptides and ProteinsSuresh Kumar Kailasa and Hui-Fen Wu
485   2.    750 μL of standard solution of analytes (proteins or peptides) were taken into a 1 mL polyethylene vial. 250 μL of known concentration of CdS QDs solution was added and pH of the test solution was controlled by adding 0.1 M HCl or NaOH. The sample vials were vortexed for 30 min at 86 ×  g  and then 1 μL of the above test solution was placed on the target plate for MALDI-TOF-MS analysis [ 17 ].      3.    The prepared HgTe nanostructures were used as concentra-tion and desorption/ionization matrixes. Sample solutions (1 mL) containing a protein, HgTe nanostructures (0.08×), and 300 mM ammonium citrate, pH 5.0 were equilibrated at ambient temperature for 30 min. The mixtures were then cen-trifuged (3,823 ×  g , 10 min), and all the supernatants were removed. The pellets were resuspended in ammonium citrate buffer (20 μL), and the sample solutions (1 μL) were pipetted onto a stainless steel target plate and allowed to air-dry for
30 min prior to SALDI-MS measurement ([ 7 ],  Note 2  ).      4.    Furthermore, HgTe nanostructures are used as the matrix for the investigation of two protein − protein complexes: α1-antitrypsin − trypsin and IgG − protein G. Trypsin (1.7 − 15 μM), α 1 -antitrypsin (5 μM), and Zn 2+  ions (0.1–4 μM) were equilibrated in ammonium citrate solutions (20–200 mM, pH 8.0, 50 μL) at 25 °C for 1 h; protein G (2–20 μM), IgG (10 μM), and Zn 2+  ions (0.1–4 μM) were equilibrated in ammonium citrate solutions (20 mM, pH 5.0, 50 μL) at 25 °C for 1 h. Equal volumes of the HgTe nanostructures (4×, 10 μL) in the presence of 0.1 or 1 % Brij 76 and one of the protein mixtures (10 μL) were mixed by vortexing for 1 min. Aliquots (1.0 μL) of the mixtures were pipetted onto a stainless-steel 96-well MALDI target and dried in air at room temperature for 30 min prior to SALDI-MS analysis [ 21 ].            1.    Eppendorf tubes are used to perform microwave-assisted tryptic
digestions of BSA, cytochrome c, α-casein, and non-fat milk. First, 50 μM of the above proteins were dissolved in 50 mM of NH 4 HCO 3  buffer (pH 8.3) containing 8.0 M of urea. To this, 2.5 μL of 1.8 M CaCl 2  was added and then reduced by the addi-tion of 5.0 μL of 50 mM DTT for few minutes. The ﬁ  nal con-centration of each protein (18.0 μM; 250 μL) was prepared by using 50 mM of NH 4 HCO 3  and urea was maintained below 2 M. To these solutions, trypsin was added at an enzyme-to- protein ratio at 1:40 (w/w) for the microwave-assisted diges-tion. The above eppendorf tubes were placed in plastic rack and then microwave irradiation was performed by applying  microwave power at 210 W for 50 s. After completion of micro-wave irradiation, sample solutions were subjected to cool for few minutes prior to enrichment procedures with nanomaterials as 3.2  Microwave- Assisted Tryptic DigestionProteomic Proﬁ  ling by Nanomaterials
486afﬁ nity probes. All the microwave tryptic-digested samples were diluted to a certain concentration with 50 % (v/v) ACN that contained 0.1 % of TFA.      2.    500 μL of non-fat milk (50-folds of dilution) was denatured by adding 50 mM of NH 4 HCO 3  and 8 M of urea and the sample vials were vortexed for a few minutes at room tempera-ture. To this, 100 μL of 50 mM DTT and 5.0 μL of 1.8 M CaCl 2  were added and then 200 μL of trypsin (mg/mL) was added. The microwave irradiation was performed at 210 W for 50 s. The sample vials were taken out and cooled for a few minutes and digested proteins were enriched by the aforesaid procedures.        A solution of the suspended nanomaterials (BaTiO 3  NPs—50 μL, 12 mg/mL; QDs-100 μL, 100 nM) was added to 150 μL of a microwave tryptic digest sample. The mixture was vortexed for 30 min at room temperature. Then, nanomaterials-conjugated digested proteins were isolated by subjecting to centrifugation at
2,655 ×  g  for 10 min at room temperature. The obtained superna-tant solution was removed using micropipette ( see   Note 3  ). The nanomaterials-conjugated digested proteins (phosphoproteins and non-phosphoproteins) were collected at the bottom of sample vial. To avoid washing procedures, directly 1 μL of 0.2 M 2,5-DHB solution was mixed with 1.0 μL of nanomaterials-conjugated digested protein solution and then 0.5 μL of nanomaterials- conjugated digested protein solution was placed on the MALDI target for MALDI-MS analysis ([ 14 ],  Note 4  ). The developed workﬂ  ow was successfully applied for the identiﬁ  cation of phos-phopeptides in milk ([ 21 ],  Note 5  ).    The nanomaterials-based SDME experiments were performed by the following procedures. The target analytes with desired concen-trations were spiked into a glass vial ﬁ  lled with 1 mL sample solu-tion. A 10 μL of microsyringe was used to draw 1 μL of toluene
containing the modiﬁ  ed nanomaterials. The microsyringe was inserted into the sample solution through a PTFE-coated silicon septum of screw cap of a glass vial. As soon as the sample was extracted into the 1 μL microdroplet of organic solvent (the modi-ﬁ ed nanomaterials prepared in toluene), the microdroplet was drawn back into the microsyringe and then directly placed the 1 μL microdroplet onto the target plates for subsequent MALDI-MS analysis ([ 16 ],  Note 6  ).   Nanomaterials-based LLME  : To this, 900 μL of standard peptide mixture (valinomycin—0.40 μM; gramicidin D—2.0 μM) was taken into a 1.0 mL polyethylene vial and then pH of the sample was adjusted by adding 1.0 M of HCl or NaOH.

487dispersed functionalized Ag 2 Se NPs (2.0 mg/mL) was added and then vortexed at 86 ×  g  for 30 min. The sample vials were allowed to stand for 3 min to separate dispersed Ag 2 Se NPs in toluene (organic) and aqueous layers. After that 2 μL of dispersed func-tionalized Ag 2 Se NPs conjugated hydrophobic peptides (valino-mycin and gramicidin D) was taken by using micropipette and mixed with equal volume of 0.2 M 2,5-DHB. The above sample was allowed to air dry prior to MALDI MS analysis [ 18 ].   For hydrophobic proteins in E. coli  : 200 μL of cultured  E. coli   (1.5 × 10 8  cfu/mL) was taken into a 1.0 mL vial and then 200 μL of HOA-modiﬁ  ed BaTiO 3  NPs dispersed in toluene was added. The vials were vortexed for 30 min at room temperature. The sam-ple vials were kept on stands for 3 min to separate NPs contained in organic layer and in aqueous layers. Then, 1.0 μL of HOA- modiﬁ  ed BaTiO 3  NPs-conjugated hydrophobic proteins (upper
layer) was mixed with 1.0 μL of 0.5 M SA. Finally, 1.0 μL of above solution was placed on the MALDI target plate, dried at room temperature and then analyzed by MALDI-MS ([ 19 ],     Note 7  ).    Among different possible bioanalytical approaches, nanomaterials- based MALDI mass spectrometry-based proteomics is increasingly used to acquire the data important for understanding these pro-cesses. For example, Mn 2+ -doped ZnS-cysteine NPs-based MALDI-MS was successfully used for the analysis of peptide mix-ture of Leu-enk (3.0 μM), Met-enk (3.0 μM), and HW6 (2.1 μM) (Fig.  1 ). It can be observed that Mn 2+ -doped ZnS-cysteine NPs- based MALDI-MS provided remarkable mass spectra for peptide mixture, corresponding to the mass peaks of peptides at  m/z  578.2, 595.3, 615.6, 906.6, and 929.5 for [Leu-enk + Na] + , [Met- enk + Na] + , [Leu-enk + K] + , [HW6 + H] + , and [HW6 + Na] + , respec-tively. All ion signals were generated with sodium and potassium
adducts while only HW6 peptide was generated as protonated ions. This reason is due to the alkali metals have greater afﬁ  nity toward the small molecules in MALDI-MS and also due to the nanomaterials as the matrix lacking of the proton sources. Moreover, large proteins were successfully detected in E. coli by using HgTe nanostructures as matrices in MALDI-MS (Fig.  2 ). The peaks at  m/z  10,770, 21,539, 10,728, and 21,454 that cor-respond to the adducts [zSSAT1 + 2H] 2+ , [zSSAT1 + H] 2+ , [zSSAT1 R101A + 2H] 2+ , and [zSSAT1R101A + H] + , respectively, resulting from the recombinant proteins of zSSAT1 or zSSAT1 R101A under individual plasmids transformed into  E. coli   strain BL21. Although zSSAT1 and zSSAT1 R101A share 99.5 % amino acid sequence homology and only one amino acid variation, our approach allowed differentiation of them, showing its potential for the rapid detection of proteins.

The sig-nals at  m/z  26,023 and 13,019 represent the [protein G + H] +  and [protein G + 2H] 2+  adducts. The mass peaks at  m/z  74,885, 49,984, 26,023, 13,019, 86,585, and 58,297 correspond to the [IgG + 2H] 2+ , [IgG + 3H] 3+ , [protein G + H] + , [protein G + 2H] 2+ , [IgG+ protein G + 2H] 2+ , and [IgG + protein G + 3H] 3+  adducts (Fig.  3 ). Using this approach, singly and multiply charged (1 + , 2 + , 3 + , and 6 + ) adducts of IgG were observed and this approach suc-cessfully allowed to detect protein G ( m/z  26,023) and IgG ( m/z  149,931) at concentrations as low as 2 μM (1 pmol) and 5 μM (2.5 pmol).

489 The identiﬁ  cation and characterization of post-translational modiﬁ  cations (PTMs) of proteins can be easily studied by  top- down fragmentation of intact protein ions. However, traditional proteoly-sis requires 6–12 h and tedious separation procedures are needed for their identiﬁ  cation. These are limitations for rapid identiﬁ  cation of digested proteins with high selectivity and sensitivity. To over-come this problem, functionalized QDs are used as afﬁ  nity probes for the enrichment of microwave-tryptic digested BSA in MALDI-MS (Fig.  4 ). Using this approach, the protein digestion time was drastically reduced from 12 h to 50 s with good sequence coverage. From the obtained MALDI mass spectrum, 11 proteo-lytic peptides (B 1 , B 3 , B 6 , B 8 , B 9 , B 16 , B 21 , B 22 , B 24 , B 25 , and B 26 ) were identiﬁ  ed from microwave tryptic digest of BSA with low sequence coverage of 26 %. In order to obtain more efﬁ  cient micro-
wave tryptic digestion of proteins, QDs-DDTC were used as con-centrating probes for the enrichment of microwave-tryptic digest of BSA without any pretreatment procedure. As a result, many digest fragments of BSA (35 peptides from B 1  to B 35 ) were observed with high signal-to-noise ratios by using QDs-DDTC as afﬁ  nity probes.

491These results indicate that the identiﬁ  ed proteolytic peptides were matched with the amino acid sequence coverage of 56 % for BSA.   Furthermore, 24 phosphopeptides (from α 1  to α 24 ) are effec-tively identiﬁ  ed with improved signal intensities using BaTiO 3  NPs as enrichment probes from the microwave tryptic digest of α-casein (Fig.  5b ). Figure  5  provides remarkable evidence that some of the low abundance phosphopeptides ( α 12 , α 16 , α 18 , α 19 , and α 20 ) are effectively identiﬁ  ed using BaTiO 3  NPs. The BaTiO 3  NPs were used as enrichment probes to concentrate phosphopeptides from non-fat milk. Notably, 21 phosphopeptides (from M α 1  to M α 21 ) were effectively detected in MALDI-MS using BaTiO 3  NPs as the concentrating probes (Table  1 ). The phosphopeptide peaks of β-casein in non-fat milk are appeared at  m/z  1,980.6, 2,350.5 and 2,475.1, which are due to dephosphorylated fragment ions (loss of
phosphorylated groups) from the ions at  m/z  2,061.2, 2,431.3 and 2,556.2, respectively (data were not shown). The identiﬁ  ed phosphopeptides in non- fat milk are listed in Table  1 .

493BaTiO 3  NPs as hydrophobic afﬁ  nity probes. Importantly, the signal intensities of hydrophobic proteins (at  m/z  5,090, 5,368, 7,009, 7,173, 7,861, and 8,405) were greatly enhanced (2–13 times) by using HOA-modiﬁ  ed BaTiO 3  NPs as extracting and preconcentrat-ing probes. The mass peaks at  m/z  3,418, 7,185, 10,855, 5,878, and 7,020 Da corresponded to the membrane proteins  ecnB  ( P56549  ),  lpp  ( P69776  ), and  osmE   ( P23933  ) and to hypothetical membrane proteins  yifL  ( P39166  ) and  ygdI  ( P65292  ), respectively. Similarly, the mass peak at  m/z  8,888 corresponded to acetyl-acyl carrier protein ( ydhI ; acetyl- ACP, P0A6A8; acetylation of the phos-phopantetheine sulfur). Evidently, ﬁ  ve lipoproteins ( ecnB, lpp, osmE, yifL, ygdI  ) and water- insoluble ATPase proteolipid (at  m/z  8,282;  atpL , P68699) were effectively extracted, preconcentrated and then identiﬁ  ed by using HOA-modiﬁ  ed BaTiO 3  NPs-LLME coupled
with MALDI-MS. Unfortunately, only one peak (at  m/z  8,405) is generated with good signal intensity, the remaining peaks [ 2 – 7 ,  11 ,  12 ] were not well resolved and some of the peaks [ 1 ,  8 ,  10 ,  23 ] were not generated by using SA as the matrix. These results indi-cated that HOA-modiﬁ  ed BaTiO 3  NPs have showed high afﬁ  nity toward hydrophobic proteins of  E. coli     , since HOA molecules on the surfaces of BaTiO 3  NPs have played a fundamental key role for the efﬁ  cient LLME of hydrophobic proteins in  E. coli   [ 19 ].      Fig. 6    MALDI mass spectra of identiﬁ  ed hydrophobic proteins in  E. coli   by using ( a ) HOA-modiﬁ  ed BaTiO 3  NPs- assisted LLME along with SA (0.5 M) as the matrix and ( b ) SA (0.5 M) as the matrix without HOA-modiﬁ  ed BaTiO 3  NPs.

4944    Notes      1.    Nanomaterials exhibited high surface area, good photostabil-ity, which results to improve the solubility in aqueous media and their conjugation with biomolecules.      2.    The mass limit when SALDI-MS was used with HgTe nano-structures as matrixes reaches up to 150,000 Da (IgG), much higher than those obtained using other kinds of nanomaterials. The HgTe nanostructures-based MALDI-MS allowed to detect weak drug–protein complexes (BSA/Y and hCAI-ACZ complexes). Importantly, HgTe nanostructures allow the anal-yses of proteins and their complexes under mild conditions and with greater tolerance toward salts.      3.    BaTiO 3  NPs are good candidatures for effective enrichment of phosphopeptides from microwave tryptic digest of α-casein. Moreover, after centrifuging of BaTiO 3  NPs–phosphopeptides conjugates from microwave tryptic digests, the trapped phos-phopeptides are directly identiﬁ  ed by MALDI-MS without
further washing procedure step. The entire procedure was completed within 60 min.      4.    The high degree of protein digestion was observed by using following microwave conditions (microwave power: 210 W and microwave irradiation time: 50 s) and trypsin-to-protein ratio (1:30, w/w) was used for the digestion of cytochrome c, lysozyme, and BSA proteins in the present study.      5.    The BaTiO 3  NPs acted as concentrating probes for phospho-peptides from microwave tryptic digest of α-casein, since trace levels of phosphopeptides ( α 12 , α 16 , α 18 , α 19 , and α 20 ) are effec-tively enriched and identiﬁ  ed without non-phosphorylated peaks. It conﬁ  rms that surfaces of BaTiO 2  NPs have high capa-bility to adsorb phosphopeptides from microwave tryptic digest of α-casein. It can be proved that BaTiO 3  NPs have well- dispersed in solution which can improve signal    intensities,  S / N  ratio and allowed unambiguous trapping of low abundance
phosphopeptides (Fig.  2 ).      6.    The    binary matrix approach applying Au NP-SDME micro-droplets which can be homogeneously mixed with the organic matrix (CHCA or SA) to form homogeneous crystals and thus favorable for sensitive detection of peptides and proteins at low concentration in MALDI-MS. In addition, the Au NP-SDME can also serve as multifunctional nanoprobes for ionization, enrichment, preconcentration, and desalting purposes for a variety of peptides and proteins. Moreover, the sample can be directly deposited onto the MALDI target plates and directly sent for MALDI-MS analysis without the need for any further washing steps or elution processes.

495   7.    HOA-functionalized BaTiO 3  NPs have attained hydrophobic nature by the functionalization of BaTiO 3  NPs surfaces with HOA (17-alkyl chains), which facilitates to enhance the ana-lytes extraction and preconcentration through hydrophobic interactions. The use of HOA in MALDI-MS highly improves its performance by acting as afﬁ  nity probes and possibly as a “buffer” in laser energy transfer to enhance the desorption/ionization of hydrophobic proteins.
