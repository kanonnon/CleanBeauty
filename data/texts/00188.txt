UV-induced immune suppression and photocarcinogenesis:Chemoprevention by dietary botanical agentsSantosh K. KatiyarDepartment of Dermatology, Environmental Health Sciences, Clinical Nutrition Research Centerand Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294,USA, and Birmingham VA Medical Center, Birmingham, AL, 35294, USAAbstractStudies of immune-suppressed transplant recipients and patients with biopsy-proven skin cancer haveconfirmed that ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced immune suppression is a risk factor for thedevelopment of skin cancer in humans. UV radiation suppresses the immune system in several ways.The UVB spectrum inhibits antigen presentation, induces the release of immunosuppressivecytokines, and elicits DNA damage that is a molecular trigger of UV-mediated immunosuppression.It is therefore important to elucidate the mechanisms underlying UV-induced immunosuppression
as a basis for developing strategies to protect individuals from this effect and subsequent developmentof skin cancer. Dietary botanicals are of particular interest as they have been shown to inhibit UV-induced immune suppression and photocarcinogenesis. In this review, we summarize the most recentinvestigations and mechanistic studies regarding the photoprotective efficacy of selected dietaryagents, including, green tea polyphenols, grape seed proanthocyanidins and silymarin. We presentevidence that these chemopreventive agents prevent UVB-induced immunosuppression andphotocarcinogenesis through: (i) The induction of immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-12;(ii) IL-12-dependent DNA repair; and (iii) Stimulation of cytotoxic T cells in the tumormicroenvironment. The new information regarding the mechanisms of action of these agents supportstheir potential use as adjuncts in the prevention of photocarcinogenesis.Keywords

It has been estimated thatmore than one million new cases of skin cancers are diagnosed each year in the United Statesalone, which is equivalent to the incidence of malignancies in all other organs combined [1].The constant increase in life expectancy, as well as changes in environmental conditions,dietary habits and lifestyle, appears to be fueling the increase in the risk of skin cancer and,according to current projections, one in five Americans will develop at least one nonmelanomaskin cancer during their life-time. The cost of treating non-melanoma skin cancer is estimatedAddress for Correspondence:  Santosh K. Katiyar, Ph.D., Department of Dermatology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 1670,

to be in excess of US$ 650 million a year, and when melanoma is included, the estimated costof treating skin cancer in the United States is US$ 2.9 billion annually (www.cancer.org/statistics). Thus, it is important to gain an improved understanding of the mechanisms thatunderlie the development of cutaneous malignancies. It is well established that the primarycause of skin cancer is the ultraviolet (UV) radiation found in sunlight. In addition to itscarcinogenic potential, UV radiation also exerts immune suppressive effects. Data from studiesof experimental animals and patients with biopsy-proven skin cancer suggest that there is anassociation between these immunosuppressive effects of UV radiation and its carcinogenicpotential.Solar UV radiation and the skinAlthough many environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of variousskin diseases, the most important factor is the chronic exposure of the skin to solar UV light.
For experimental purposes, the UV radiation present in sun light typically is considered interms of the effects the short-wave (UVC; 200-290 nm), mid-wave (UVB; 290-320 nm), andlong-wave (UVA; 320-400 nm) components of the radiation. UVB radiation is a mutagen, andextensive epidemiological evidence has indicated that it is UVB radiation that is responsiblefor the induction of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers [2]. UVB radiation also hasbeen shown to be responsible for sunburn, oxidative stress, and immune suppression. Notably,decreases in the stratospheric ozone layer are permitting more UVB radiation to reach theEarth's surface [3]. In contrast, although UVC radiation is a potent mutagen and can induceimmune suppression, it is absorbed by the stratospheric ozone layer and its role as a causativeagent in human disease is minimal. UVA, the major component of the UV spectrum (>90%),does cause premature aging of the skin, induce oxidative stress, and can suppress immune
system although its effect are less pronounced than UVB radiation.Skin represents the first barrier that protects the body from external environmental pollutants,including solar UV radiation and environmental chemicals. The skin is the largest organ inhumans, having a surface area of approximately 1.5-2.0 m2. Morphologically, it is made up ofa variety of cell types and organellar bodies, each of which has a particular function. The majorcell types are organized in layers, which include the epidermis, the dermis, and the hypodermis.For the most part, it is the epidermal layer that is associated with development of skin cancer.The major cell type in the epidermis is the keratinocyte, which comprises >90% of the cells ofthe epidermal layer. It should be noted that in laboratory animals, such as the mouse, theepidermis is about 2-3 cell layers thick, whereas in humans, it is about 8-15 cell layers thick.
Thus, human skin is more protective than mouse skin against environmental factors, includingthe effects of UV radiation.UV radiation and immune suppressionBoth UVA and UVB radiation suppress the immune systems of humans and mice. In additionto suppressing tumor immunity, UV exposure has been shown to suppress a wide variety ofother immune reactions, including contact hypersensitivity (CHS) to chemical haptens [ 4], anddelayed-type hypersensitivity to viral [ 5], bacterial [ 6] and fungal [ 7] antigens. CHS representsa special form of the delayed-type hypersensitivity response. It is induced by epicutaneousapplication of contact allergens, and is a prototypic T-cell-mediated immune response [ 8]. CHSmodels are used to evaluate UVB-induced suppression of immune responses. Typically, twoCHS models are utilized to differentiate between local and systemic effects. In the CHS modelof local immune suppression, the hapten is applied directly to the UV-irradiated skin. In the
CHS model of systemic immune suppression, the UV radiation is applied to one site, and the
of local immune suppression, the hapten is applied directly to the UV-irradiated skin. In theCHS model of systemic immune suppression, the UV radiation is applied to one site, and thehapten or antigen is applied to a distant non-irradiated site. Using these models, it has beenclearly established that UVB radiation induces both local and systemic immune suppression,Katiyar Page 2Cancer Lett .

although the systemic immunosuppression clearly is mediated by mechanisms than those thatlead to local immunosuppression.It is well established that UV radiation stimulates keratinocytes to release immunosuppressivesoluble mediators, including interleukin (IL)-10. These soluble mediators can then enter thecirculation and can thus suppress the immune system in a systemic manner. Moreover, it hasbeen shown that intravenous injection of supernatants obtained from UV-exposedkeratinocytes into naïve mice renders the recipients unresponsive to hapten sensitization [9].Thus, UV-induced immunosuppressive mediators derived from keratinocytes may enter thecirculation and inhibit immune reactions at skin sites that are not exposed directly to UVradiation.UV radiation-induced immune suppression is a risk factor for skin cancerUV radiation has been shown to have multiple effects on the immune system [ 10,11 ]; however,
if prevention of immune suppression is to be considered an effective strategy, it is necessaryto determine whether the altered immune responses contribute to the pathogenesis of UV-induced skin cancer. There now are several lines of clinical and experimental evidence thatindicate that immune factors contribute to the pathogenesis of UV-induced skin cancer in miceand, most likely, in humans [ 10,12 ]. The rate of skin cancer is exceptionally high in chronicallyimmunosuppressed patients living in regions of intense sun exposure [ 13]. This observation isconsistent with the hypothesis that immune surveillance plays an important role in theprevention of the generation and maintenance of neoplastic cells [14]. The incidence of skincancers, especially squamous cell carcinomas, is also elevated among organ transplantrecipients [15-18]. Studies of 2,561 kidney and heart transplant recipients indicated a 66-fold
higher risk of squamous cell carcinoma than the risk in the general population [19,20]. Acomprehensive study of 5,356 transplant recipients in Sweden showed that they have a 100-fold higher relative risk of developing nonmelanoma skin cancer, almost exclusively in sun-exposed areas of the skin [21]. This increased frequency of squamous cell carcinomas ispresumably attributable to long-term immunosuppressive therapy [ 22]. Although the absoluterisk of squamous-cell carcinoma after renal transplantation is highest in sunny climates, therisk of these tumors is also greatly elevated in less sunny geographic areas as suggested by theSwedish study [ 21] and a study of more than 700 renal-transplant recipients in the Netherlandswhich indicated that the overall incidence of squamous-cell carcinoma was 250 times greaterthan that in the general Dutch population [23]. In immunosuppressed patients, cutaneous
cancers are common in areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun; moreover, they are moreaggressive than in patients who are not immunosuppressed, are sometimes fatal, and oftenrequire multiple surgical procedures. The reasons for the dramatic greater incidence of thesetumors among immunosuppressed patients is not understood completely, although it is oftenattributed to a reduction in cancer surveillance owing to pan-immunosuppression resultingfrom drug therapy and exposure to UVB radiation.It has been suggested that the induction of DNA photoproducts [24] and reactive oxygenintermediates [25] by UVB radiation compromises cutaneous immunity. It also has beensuggested that the release of cytokines following UVB radiation plays a significant role inUVB-induced immunosuppression and, thus, may be an important factor in the growth anddevelopment of immunogenic UV-induced skin tumors [10-12]. Of potential significance is
the fact that a number of tumors, including some melanomas and non-melanoma skin cancer,appear to produce IL-10 [11,26,27]. The immunosuppressive effects of IL-10 may be one ofthe mechanisms by which these tumors escape immunologic control [27]. The focus of this

potential and mechanisms of action of some dietary botanicals that protect the skin from UV-induced immune suppression and afford protection from UV-induced carcinogenesis (Fig. 2).UV radiation alters the function of Langerhans cells thereby affecting theimmune systemLangerhans cells are the major antigen presenting cells in the skin [11] and represent a majorcomponent of the dendritic cell network that plays a key role in the development of immuneresponses including CHS. UV irradiation has been shown to have multiple deleterious effectson Langerhans cells and mice sensitized through UV-irradiated skin fail to generate CHSresponse to contact allergens [8]. UV irradiation results in a depletion of Langerhans cells inthe skin [ 8]. This may be due to the emigration of Langerhans cells from the skin to the draininglymph nodes since Langerhans cells harboring UV-induced DNA damage can be detected in
the draining lymph nodes [28]. In addition, UV exposure impairs the ability of Langerhanscells to present antigens, thus further compromising the dendritic cell network [ 8]. UV radiationsuppresses the expression of major histocompatibility (MHC) class II surface molecules onLangerhans cells and their adenosine triphosphatase activity [29]. Both of these markers areused to identify Langerhans cells in the epidermis. Inhibition of the expression of the adhesionmolecule ICAM-1 by UV radiation may be responsible for impaired clustering of Langerhanscells and T cells. Other antigen presenting cells, including human peripheral blood-deriveddendritic cells and splenic dendritic cells, also exhibit a significant impairment in their abilityto stimulate allogeneic T cells when exposed to UV both in vitro  and in vivo . It has been reportedthat UVB-induced reactive oxygen species may contribute to the impairment of the function
of antigen presenting cells [ 30]. Antigen presentation may also be impaired by the photoproductcis-urocanic acid and by immunosuppressive cytokines, such as IL-10. Taken together, theseobservations suggest that the deleterious effects of UV irradiation on Langerhans cells play akey role in the induction of UV-induced immune suppression [11].UV-induced DNA damage triggers immunosuppressionUV-induced DNA damage, predominantly in the form of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers(CPDs), has been recognized as an important molecular trigger for the suppression of immuneresponses and initiation of UV-induced carcinogenesis [ 24,31,32 ]. UV-induced DNA damageis an important event in the migration of antigen presenting cells ( i.e., Langerhans cells in theepidermis) from the skin to the draining lymph nodes. DNA damage in antigen presenting cellsimpairs their capacity to present antigen, which in turn results in a lack of sensitization [33].
CPD-containing antigen presenting cells have been found in the draining lymph nodes of UV-exposed mice [ 28,34 ]. These antigen presenting cells were determined to be of epidermal originand to exhibit an impaired ability to present antigen. Thus, UV-induced DNA damage is oneof the earliest molecular events in the development of immune suppression. To directly testthis concept, pyrimidine dimer formation has been repaired in mice by application of liposomescontaining the bacteriophage excision repair enzyme, T4N5, to the skin of the UV-irradiatedanimals. This resulted in a reduction in the number of CPDs in epidermal DNA, and,subsequently, a reduction in the induction of immune suppression. The abrogation of UVB-induced immune suppression by T4N5-containing liposomes was associated with a reductionin the induction of suppressor T cells in the UV-irradiated mice [24].The immunoregulatory cytokine, IL-12, also has been shown to remove, or repair, UV-induced
DNA damage in the skin [35]. Depending on the severity of the DNA damage following UVexposure of the skin, keratinocytes in the skin can progress to either apoptosis or DNA repair
DNA damage in the skin [35]. Depending on the severity of the DNA damage following UVexposure of the skin, keratinocytes in the skin can progress to either apoptosis or DNA repairpathways [28,36]. If the DNA damage is irreparable, the cell cycle is arrested and thekeratinocyte is transformed into a sunburn cell, which is an early morphologic indicator ofepidermal cell apoptosis. To examine the role of IL-12 in removal of UVB-induced DNAKatiyar Page 4Cancer Lett .

damage, we compared the effects of acute low-dose UVB exposure on the numbers of CPDcells in the skin of IL-12-deficient or knock out (IL-12 KO) and in the skin of their wild-typecounterparts, C3H/HeN mice. We observed that in wild-type mice, there were considerablylower numbers of UV-induced CPD-positive cells in the skin at 24 hours or 48 hours after UVexposure than immediately after exposure. In contrast, the numbers of CPD-positive cells inthe skin of the IL-12 KO mice did not exhibit a significant reduction at 24 hours or 48 hoursafter UV exposure. This suggested that the endogenous DNA repair mechanism requires thepresence of IL-12 in mice, which was further indicated by the finding that subcutaneousinjection of recombinant IL-12 into the UV-irradiated skin of the IL-12 KO mice enhanced therepair of UVB-induced CPDs. These findings support the concept that IL-12 has the ability torepair UVB-induced DNA damage in vivo , at least in animal models [35,37].
Induction of T regulatory cellsThe induction of hapten-specific tolerance by UV radiation appears to be mediated, at least inpart, through the generation of T cells with suppressive or inhibitory immune activity. The UV-induced suppressor T cells mediate their suppressive effects by releasing immune regulatoryfactors, particularly IL-10 [ 11,38 ]. Several different regulatory T cells with unique phenotypeshave been identified as being involved in the various different models of UV-mediatedtolerance (local, systemic, high and low dose) [38]. These cells may represent a separatesubtype of regulatory T (T-reg) cells since they exhibit characteristics of naturally occurringregulatory T cells, e.g., expression of CD4 and CD25, but also of type 1 regulatory R (Tr1)cells, e.g., release of IL-10 [ 11,38 ]. Cells transferring suppression in the low-dose CHS modelappear to belong to the CD4+CD25+ subtype, they express CTLA-4 [11,38], bind the lectin
dectin-2 [39] and, in contrast to the classical CD4+CD25+ T cells, release high amounts ofIL-10 upon antigen-specific activation [11,38].IL-12 has been shown to prevent the suppression of CHS by UV, to prevent the developmentof regulatory T cells and even to break UV-induced tolerance by yet un-identified mechanisms[38,40,41 ]. Since a reduction in UV-induced DNA damage is associated with the inhibition ofUV-induced immunosuppression, DNA damage is regarded as the major molecular trigger ofUV-induced immunosuppression [ 24,42 ]. The prevention of UV-induced immunosuppressionby IL-12 may be due to its capacity to reduce DNA damage via induction of DNA repair [ 35,37] since the preventive effect of IL-12 is not observed in mice that are deficient in DNA repair[28]. UV-induced DNA damage appears to be an important event in the UV-mediated inductionof regulatory T cells. This assumption is based on the observation that a reduction in
Langerhans cells containing DNA damage in the regional lymph nodes by IL-12 prevents thedevelopment of regulatory T cells [28]. Notably, UV-induced regulatory T cells also appearto play an important role in photocarcinogenesis.UV-induced immune suppression in humansThe majority of information regarding UV-induced immune suppression is derived fromstudies of experimental animal models, mostly mice. There is, however, evidence that UVradiation also suppresses the induction of CHS in humans. In humans, the induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity [11,43] and CHS [11,44] is suppressed after a single, or short-term,exposure to UV radiation. In addition, immune suppressive cytokines, such as IL-10, areproduced in human skin in response to UV exposure, although the identity of the cell thatreleases IL-10 may be different in humans and mice [45]. UV exposure suppresses humanantigen-presenting cell function with the doses of UV irradiation that induce immune
suppression in humans and mice being comparable [ 11]. Many of the mechanisms involved in
antigen-presenting cell function with the doses of UV irradiation that induce immunesuppression in humans and mice being comparable [ 11]. Many of the mechanisms involved inUV-induced immune suppression in humans are similar to those described in experimentalanimals. UV-induced DNA damage triggers immune regulatory cytokine production andKatiyar Page 5Cancer Lett .

triggers immune suppression. Wolf et al. [46] observed that exposure of human skin to solarsimulated light resulted in the up-regulation of IL-10 and TNF- α in the epidermis. Applicationof T4N5-containing liposomes to the skin of UV-irradiated individuals immediately after UVexposure inhibits cytokine production and Stege et al. [ 47] found that repair of CPDs in humanskin using photolyase prevented UV-induced suppression of the CHS response. Moreover,sensitivity to sunburn appears to be associated with susceptibility to UV radiation-inducedsuppression of cutaneous cell-mediated immunity in humans [44].Role of dietary agents in the prevention of UV-induced immune suppressionThere has been great interest in the use of dietary agents that are derived from plants for thephotoprotection of the skin, including their use to reduce the risk of melanoma andnonmelanoma skin cancers. Dietary botanicals, possessing anti-inflammatory,
immunomodulatory and anti-oxidant properties are among the most promising group ofcompounds that can be exploited as ideal chemopreventive agents for skin diseases. Amongthe botanical agents that have been identified as having potential chemopreventive activitiesare retinoids, green tea polyphenols, grape seed proanthocyanidins, resveratrol, curcumin andsilymarin [48 ]. Importantly we should recognize that nutrition now includes food componentsthat do not provide nutrition in the traditional sense, in that they do not contribute calories, norare metabolized to building blocks for proteins, carbohydrates or fats. Yet their inclusion inthe diet appears to have important health benefits particularly with regard to age-related chronicdiseases including cancers. Polyphenols, particularly the catechins and proanthocyanidins thatare contained in certain leaves and in some seeds, appear to have important health benefits
particularly with regard to age-related diseases. Dietary supplements containing theseingredients are widely available over-the-counter remedies for age-related diseases. Moreover,as far as skin is concerned, most skin care lotions or sunscreens are applied topically on theskin for health benefits. This indicates that skin has the ability to consume its nutrition throughtopical application of nutrients. Therefore, it is important to mention that nutrition for the skincan be provided through both oral and topical administration. Here, we will particularly discussand summarize the effects of green tea polyphenols, grape seed proanthocyanidins andsilymarin on the UV radiation-induced immune suppression, which is considered as a potentialrisk factor for the development of skin cancers.Dietary agents prevent UV-induced immune suppressionAs discussed above, the immunosuppressive effects of solar UV radiation (both UVA and
UVB) are well established. Many of the adverse effects of solar UV radiation on human health,including exacerbation of infectious diseases and induction of skin cancer, are mediated at leastin part by the ability of UV radiation to induce immune suppression (10,12,49). As UV-inducedimmunosuppression is considered as a risk factor for the induction of skin cancer, preventionof UV-induced immunosuppression represents a potential strategy for the management of skincancers in humans. We have shown that topical administration of green tea polyphenols(GTPs), a mixture of polyphenols or epicatechin derivatives, to C3H/HeN mice resulted in asignificant protection against local and systemic models of CHS in which 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene was used as a contact sensitizer [50]. Similar effects were also notedwhen a water extract of green tea was given to mice as the sole source of drinking water. ( −)-
Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was found to be the most effective constituent of the GTPsand has been shown to prevent UVB-induced suppression of CHS when applied topically[51,Table 1]. The prevention of UVB-induced immunosuppression by EGCG treatment was
and has been shown to prevent UVB-induced suppression of CHS when applied topically[51,Table 1]. The prevention of UVB-induced immunosuppression by EGCG treatment wasfound to be associated with a reduction in the number of infiltrating CD11b+ cells (a cell surfacemarker of macrophages and neutrophils) in UVB-irradiated skin [51]. The blocking of UV-induced infiltration of leukocytes using anti-CD11b antibody inhibited UV-induced immunesuppression and tolerance induction in C3H/HeN mice [52]. Therefore, it appears thatKatiyar Page 6Cancer Lett . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2008 September 18.NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript
inhibition of UV-induced immunosuppression by EGCG is mediated, at least in part, throughthe inhibition of infiltrating activated macrophages and neutrophils in the UVB-irradiated skin.In UVB-irradiated skin, IL-10 is secreted, primarily by activated macrophages, and acts todown-regulate CHS responses. Intraperitoneal administration of IL-10 to mice inhibiteddelayed type hypersensitivity responses, and intraperitoneal injection of anti-IL-10 antibodyprevented UV-induced tolerance induction [53]. In accordance with these observations, bytopical application of EGCG to the mouse skin resulted in a lower level of IL-10 in the UV-irradiated skin, as well as in the draining lymph nodes, than in mice which were not treatedwith EGCG. Treatment of mice with EGCG significantly reduced the number of IL-10producing cells and this was accompanied with a reduction in infiltrating leukocytes [ 51]. Thissuggests a possible mechanism by which EGCG prevents UVB-induced immune suppression
in mice.Topical treatment with EGCG prior to UVB exposure also resulted in an enhancement in thelevels of IL-12 in the skin and draining lymph nodes as compared to the levels of IL-12 in theskin and lymph nodes of non-EGCG treated but UVB-exposed mice [51]. Higher levels ofIL-12 may contribute to stimulation of the anti-tumor immune response. Recently, Meeran etal. [34] have shown that topical treatment of EGCG prevented UV-induced suppression ofCHS in wild-type mice as shown by a significant enhancement of the CHS response (earswelling). In contrast, UV-exposed IL-12-deficient or knockout (KO) mice remainedunresponsive to dinitrofluorobenzene, a sensitizer, despite the application of EGCG on themouse skin. This suggests that the immunopreventive effect of EGCG against UV-inducedsuppression of the CHS response requires IL-12. Further, intraperitoneal injection of C3H/HeNmice with anti-IL-12 antibody significantly reduced the preventive effect of EGCG on UV-
induced suppression of CHS. These studies provide convincing evidence that prevention ofUV-induced immunosuppression by EGCG is mediated, at least in part, through IL-12induction.Similar chemopreventive effects on UV-induced immunosuppression have been observed instudies of other botanicals. We have observed that supplementation of a control AIN76A dietwith grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs) markedly inhibited photocarcinogenesis in mice[54]. It also was found that dietary GSPs prevent UVB-induced suppression of the CHSresponse in a local model of immunosuppression and had moderate inhibitory effects in asystemic model of CHS [55]. Dietary GSPs reduced UVB-induced increases in the levels ofIL-10 in the skin and enhanced the production of IL-12 in C3H/HeN mice. Intraperitonealinjection of GSP-fed mice with a neutralizing anti-IL-12 antibody abrogated the protectiveeffects of the GSPs against UVB-induced suppression of the CHS [55]. Silymarin, a product
of milk thistle, is another botanical agent that has been tested for its ability to prevent UVB-induced immunosuppression. Topical treatment with silymarin significantly inhibitedphotocarcinogenesis in SKH-1 hairless mice [ 56]. More recently, we have tested the effect ofsilymarin on UVB-induced immunosuppression using local and systemic models of CHS inC3H/HeN mice [57]. We found that topical treatment of mice with silymarin inhibited UVB-induced immunosuppression in mice, and that the mechanism of action appeared to be similarto that described above for GTPs and GSPs. Taken together, these observations indicate thatcertain botanicals with anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties can protect the skin fromthe adverse biological effects of UV radiation and that they share very similar mechanisms ofaction.Katiyar Page 7Cancer Lett .

Inhibition of UV-induced immunosuppression is mediated through IL-12-dependent DNA repairUV-induced DNA damage in the form of CPDs is an important molecular trigger for UV-induced immunosuppression and photocarcinogenesis [ 28,35 ] and that a reduction in the levelsof UV-induced CPDs can prevent UV-induced immunosuppression [ 24,34 ]. It has been shownthat IL-12 has the ability to remove or repair UV-induced CPDs [35]. We and others [28,34]have shown that the prevention of UV radiation-induced immunosuppression by IL-12 isdependent on DNA repair and that it acts through the induction of a nucleotide excision repairmechanism. The effect of topically administered EGCG on UV-induced CPDs in IL-12 KOmice, as compared with their wild-type counterparts, has been determined. Twenty-four hoursafter UV-irradiation, the numbers of CPD-positive cells were significantly lower in the EGCG-treated wild-type mice than in the wild-type mice that were not treated with EGCG but were
exposed to UVB. In contrast, the UVB-induced DNA damage in the IL-12 KO mice that hadbeen treated with EGCG did not differ from that in the IL-12 KO mice that had not been treatedwith EGCG [34]. These observations suggest that EGCG-induced IL-12 contributes to therepair of UV-damaged DNA and that this leads to the prevention of UV-induced immunesuppression and photocarcinogenesis [34,58].UV-induced DNA damage has been identified as an important molecular trigger for themigration of antigen presenting cells (Langerhans cells) from the skin to the draining lymphnodes. DNA damage in antigen presenting cells impairs their capacity to present antigen, whichin turn results in a lack of sensitization [33]. CPD-containing antigen presenting cells havebeen found in the draining lymph nodes of UV-exposed mice. The cells were identified asbeing of epidermal origin and found to exhibit an impaired antigen presentation capacity.
Immunohistochemical analysis of CPD-positive cells in draining lymph nodes obtained 36hours after UV irradiation revealed significantly higher numbers of CPD-positive cells in UV-exposed wild-type mice and IL-12 KO mice as compared to unexposed wild-type mice;however, the numbers of CPD-positive cells in the draining lymph nodes of the UV-exposedIL-12 KO mice were approximately 4-fold higher than in the draining lymph nodes of theirUV-exposed wild-type counterparts. The lower percentage of CPD-positive cells in the lymphnodes of UV-exposed wild-type mice than UV-exposed IL-12 KO mice may be attributable tothe presence of endogenous IL-12 in the wild-type mice at levels that are capable of partialremoval of the damaged DNA in the migrating cells. Treatment of mice with EGCG resultedin a significant reduction in the numbers of CPD-positive cells in the draining lymph nodes ofUV-exposed wild-type mice as compared to the numbers in the lymph nodes of UV-exposed
wild-type mice that did not receive EGCG. In contrast, there was no significant difference inthe number of CPD-positive cells in the draining lymph nodes of EGCG-treated and non-EGCG-treated UV-exposed IL-12 KO mice [34]. This observation provides further evidencethat the reduction in the numbers of CPD-positive cells in the draining lymph nodes of wild-type mice after EGCG treatment may be due to EGCG-induced IL-12-mediated repair of CPDsin the cells.Green tea polyphenols stimulate cytotoxic T cells in skin tumorsIL-12 has been shown to stimulate the production of IFN γ and stimulate the development ofcytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells), which are tumoricidal. These effects of IL-12 may result ininhibition of tumor growth or regression of the tumors. Administration of GTPs in the drinkingwater inhibits UV-induced skin tumor development in SKH-1 hairless mice [59]. It was alsoobserved that the numbers of CD8+ T cells in the tumors of the UVB-exposed mice that were
treated with GTPs were higher than in the tumors of the UVB-exposed mice that were not
observed that the numbers of CD8+ T cells in the tumors of the UVB-exposed mice that weretreated with GTPs were higher than in the tumors of the UVB-exposed mice that were nottreated with GTPs. This study suggests that GTPs can inhibit tumor growth by more than onemechanism. CD8+ T cells are the effector cells in the cytotoxic response of the host to UV-Katiyar Page 8Cancer Lett .

induced skin tumor cells. They play an important role in protection against tumor immunity,at least in photocarcinogenesis. It is possible that EGCG-induced IL-12 plays a role instimulation of CD8-positive cells. Similar observations were noted when the mice were treatedtopically with EGCG and subjected to a photocarcinogenesis protocol [60].Conclusion and future prospects of dietary agents in the prevention of photo-immunosuppressionThe mechanistic studies which have been summarized in this review article indicate thepotential beneficial effects of dietary agents in the prevention of UV-induced immunesuppression and subsequent prevention of photocarcinogenesis in experimental animals. Thebotanical agents discussed proved to be effective in the animal models whether administeredin the drinking water, as dietary supplements, or topically, depending on the nature of the agent.The supplementation of the use of sunscreens with these dietary agents may provide an effective
strategy for the prevention of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers in humans. The dietarybotanical agents discussed are considered to be non-toxic and pharmacologically safe forhuman consumption. Clinical trials are needed to validate the preventive and therapeuticmedicinal value of these dietary agents, either alone or in combination with existing therapiesfor melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers, in high-risk human populations.AcknowledgmentsThe work reported from the author's laboratory was supported by the funds from National Institutes of Health(CA104428, CA105368, CA089738, ES11421, AT002536), Cancer Research and Prevention Foundation and VAMerit Review Award.
