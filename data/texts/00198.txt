Hairs can be defined as -"improved epithelial structure formed as a result of keratinization of germinative cells," hairs are the  outgrowths from the follicles present on the skin. Hair is composed of keratin with chemical constituents such as Carbon(C), Nitrogen (N), Sulfur(S), & Oxygen (O).  Hair growth varies from person to person but on average hair grows about 15 -30 mm/ month. Hair is the one of the vital parts of the body derived from ectoderm of the skin, and is protective appendages on the body.  Hairs are two types :  1. Vellushair.  2. Terminal hair  Vellus hairs are fine, light colored and straight.                      Terminal hair are thicker dark and may be curly and on the region of eyelashes and eyebrows. 70 -100 hairs loss a day is very common however, dropping over 100 hairs a day lasting longer than a couple of week indicates a serious problem.,.    Alopecia, a dermatological disorder that has been
recognized for more than 2000 years is a common problem in cosmetic as well as primary health care practices. It is a common throughout the world and has been estimated to affect between 0.2% and 2% of the world population. Various synthetic medicines are available for hair loss which does not treat permanently and also shows severe side effects. These problems could be solved by. The use of herbal medicines.

TYPES OF HAIR LOSS :  a) Alopecia Areata (prime stage) -  Alopecia  areata is a common autoimmune disease that  results in the loss of hair on the scalp and else where. It usually starts with one or more small,  round, non -scarring smooth patches. Mild Brief  Alopecia Areata - Patient with repeated transient  alopecia areata but never converts into alopecia  totalis or universalis  b) Temporary Alopecia Areata - Patient with  Alopecia areata in advanced phase and some of  them converts into Alopecia totalis/Alopecia  universalis.  c) Ophiasis Alopecia Areata - Ophiasis type of  alopecia areata shows a band like hair loss. It  occurs generally in the progressive or the occip ital areas of the scalp, and therefore it is more
difficult to treat, as most medicines have a de layed action on these areas.  d) Alopecia Totalis - Loss of hair from whole  Scalp.  e) Alopecia Universalis - Loss of hair from entire  body including eyebrows and eyelashes Scar ring Alopecia Any inflammatory process  (burns, bacterial infections, ringworm, injury)  necessary to cause permanent loss of follicles,  affected area known as Scarring alopecia.   Trichotillomania -This type of hair loss is  known as compulsive pulling or dull self - pulling by a patient Himself or herself.  f) Traction Alopecia - Hair elegance that tie hairs  so tight can causes much traction at the root of  hairs, and can develop adhesion alopecia        g) Chemotherapy and hair loss  - Chemotherapy  is exclusive behavior for cancer patients but it  marks normal cells and hair follicles too. This  causes hair loss and known as  anagen  effluvium type of alopecia.  h) Diffuse Alopecia - Unnecessary Loss of hair all
over the scalp without creating a reinforcement.  Hair loss due to side effect of the beauty  treatments - Any beauty treatments like hair  colors, dye, straightening, softening,  rebounding, perming etc., which contains harsh  chemicals can trigger hair loss for some  individuals. Telogen effluvium (TE) and  chronic telogen effluvium - (CTE) Dietary  lacks, Crash dieting High grade fever, Anemia,  Blood loss, Hormonal imbalance and  pregnancy etc. can cause telogen effluvium  type of hair loss telogen word is known for  latent phase of the hair and fluvium means.  2. Hair Growth Cycle and Its Mechanism  The hair growth undergoes a tiresome cycle where the anagen phase followed by the catagen and the telogen phase [7]. In the anagen phase, the hair is actively growing while in the catagen phase it is characterized by the degeneration and resorption of the lower region of the hair follicle. The resting phase, where the hair is inactive, is called telogen
phase after this phase the growth of the hair follicle resumes in the scalp, a hair growth cycle has three main phases: Anagen, catagen, and telogen. The anagen phase is the growth cycle typically lasts 3 -5 years. On a healthy scalp, there are approximately 1,000,000 hair and 90% of the follicles are continually in the anagen phase of hair growth. The catagen stage follows the end of the growth period when a follicle begins to become dormant. The telogen stage is a dormant or resting period that lasts 3-4 months. When the dormant phase ends, an old hair falls out. A hair follicle then returns to the anagen stage, and a new hair begins to grow. An average rate of hair growth is about half an inch per month depending on hair follicles and age of an individual. On average, 50 -60 scalp hairs are lost daily in a normal hair growth cycle and new hairs begin to grow from these follicles. Hair loss begins when less new hair begins the re -growth stage.
when less new hair begins the re -growth stage.  3. Symptoms of Hair Loss
daily in a normal hair growth cycle and new hairs begin to grow from these follicles. Hair loss begins when less new hair begins the re -growth stage.  3. Symptoms of Hair Loss  There are several factors for the hair loss; some of the main factors are given below  -  Acute illness   Autoimmune disorders    Chemicals (hair dyes)   Chemotherapeutic agents/ drugs.    Diabetes   Hair loss following childbirth   Hair styling products   Hair styling techniques   High iron deficiency   Nutritional deficiencies   Other fungal infections   Physical trauma to the scalp   Poisons   Poor blood circulation   Poor diet or malnutrition   Prescription drugs   Psychological   Radiation exposure   Ringworm   Skin disease   Stress   Sudden weight loss   Surgery   Thyroid disease.

The Herbs Used in The Treatment of Alopecia Provide One of the Following  1.  Nutritional support.  2.  DHT blockers and 5 -α-Reductase blockers.  3. Aromatherapy and improved scalp blood Circulation.  1. Nutritional Support:  Minerals such as calcium, copper, chromium, iodine,                                   zinc, and magnesium are necessary to maintain healthy hair growth. Mineral deficiency will reduce the chance to regulate the blood circulation that promotes healthy hair growth and thyroid hormones that prevent dry hair and hair loss as well as defects in hair color. Too much iron is toxic to your body. Be sure to talk to your doctor before taking any mineral supplement. B vitamins (especially B6, B3, B5 and
folic acid), biotin (anti -oxidant, sources of biotin is: whole grains, egg yolks, liver, rice and milk. Vitamin A is important for over -all good health. It ’s also beneficial to hair follicles, as it keeps the hair root lubricated. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant that aids real circulation in the scalp due to increased oxygen uptake in blood, therefore it plays an important role in promoting hair growth and preventing hair loss. Coenzyme Q10 (CQ -10) is an essential vitamin that provides our body with the nutrient needed to grow healthy hair. They also promote overall vitality, and contribute to beautiful skin and strong nails. Yogurt and soy, dark green vegetable, whole grain products, essential fatty acid, nuts and seedier fatty foods which are typically the best sources of vitamin E, an immune enhancing antioxidant and nerve protector. Carrots contain high amounts of vitamin A. It is an antioxidant that helps produce healthy sebum in the
scalp. Having too much vitamin A can lead to hair loss. There are many other foods that help promote hair growth and prevent hair loss, such as fruits, egg, spinach, and broccoli. The various herbs providing nutritional support are summarized below in :  2.  DHT Blockers and 5 -α-Reductase blockers 7,  8, 9, 10  After knowing the well -established role of DHT in hair loss, it is recommended that the use of herbs that have pronounced DHT or 5 -α-Reductase blocking activity can be used for the treatment of Alopecia (especiallyAndrogenetic). There are some herbs that have proved DHT blocking activity like Pygeum africanum, Seneroa repens, Urtica dioica and others with potential 5 - α-Reductase inhibiting ability like Camellia sinensis, Panax ginseng etc (table 1.). The proposed mechanism of action of DHT blockers and 5-α-Reductase blockers  3. Aromatherapy:  Aromatherapy can be used as a supplement to treat alopecia. It uses highly concentrated extracts which
are derived from the flowers, leaves, bark and the roots of various plants like Arnica montana, Cedrus atlantica, Lavandula agustifolia, Oscimum sanctum, Pilocarpus jabarondi, Rosmarinus officinalis, Thyme vulgaris etc., (table 2). In aromatherapy, the essential oils enter the body through the olfactory system (inhalation) and/or through your skin. As with herbs that are taken orally, the essential oils reach the circulatory system (the blood) where they bind to receptors and change the chemical composition. These oils work not only on a cellular level to strengthen/calm the nervous system, but also on a spiritual one, providing with a sense of wellbeing. Topical herbal therapy stimulates hair follicles and it is proved as safest way to cope up with different type of hair loss (alopecia), however perfect pharmacological actions of these herbs and oils are yet not known  3. Here ’s Used in Treatment of Alopecia  a. Ginkgo biloba (Ginkgoaceae)

[4] Green tea contains a high amount of purine  alkaloids, flavonoids, caffic acid derivative,  volatile oil and catechins including  epigallocatechin gallate. Epigallocatechin  gallate isolated from the leaves of Camellia  sinensis and investigated for its effect on  human dermal papilla cells in vivo and in vitro.  The Epigallocatechin gallate showed  significant result by  hair growth in vitro by  up regulatingphosphorylated ERK and Akt and  byincreasing the BCl -2/Bax ratio36.  [5] Ethanolic extract and petroleum ether extract of  Citrullus colocynthis were evaluated for hair,  growth activity on albino rats by Roy et al. 2%  and 5% of ethanolic and petroleum ether  extract ointment were applied on the skin of  rats. The hair growth initiation was found on  4th day with5% and 5th day with 2% petrolium
4th day with5% and 5th day with 2% petrolium  ether extract group while hair growth initiation  was found on the 6th with menoxidil  treated group. The rate of hair growth initiation  was found to be in ethanol extract treated group  but it was less as compare to petroleum ether  extract37.  [6] Rhodes et al has investigated the Primula  obconica leaffor its hair growth activity on  human volunteers. The patient was firstly  sensitized to Primula obconica by wearing a  leaf then in one group given corticosteroids was  used and in another group Primula obconica  was applied after one month of treatment it was  found the Primula obconica was much more  effective than corticosteroids38.
