The commercial production of this pigment hastraditionally been performed by chemical synthesis, but the microalga Haematococcus pluvialis appears
to be the most promising source for its industrial biological production. Due to its collectivediverse functions in skin biology, there is mounting evidence that astaxanthin possesses varioushealth beneﬁts and important nutraceutical applications in the ﬁeld of dermatology. Although stilldebated, a range of potential mechanisms through which astaxanthin might exert its beneﬁts on skinhomeostasis have been proposed, including photoprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inﬂammatoryeffects. This review summarizes the available data on the functional role of astaxanthin in skinphysiology, outlines potential mechanisms involved in the response to astaxanthin, and highlightsthe potential clinical implications associated with its consumption.Keywords: astaxanthin; skin; aging; ultraviolet; antioxidant; anti-inﬂammatory; immune-enhancing;DNA repair; clinical trials1. IntroductionThe ketocarotenoid astaxanthin (ASX), 3,30-dihydroxy-b,b-carotene-4,40-dione, was originally
isolated from a lobster by Kuhn and Sorensen [ 1]. Currently, ASX is a renowned compound for itscommercial application in various industries comprising aquaculture, food, cosmetics, nutraceuticals,and pharmaceuticals. ASX was ﬁrst commercially used for pigmentation only in the aquacultureindustry to increase ASX content in farmed salmonids and obtain the characteristic orange-redcolor of the ﬂesh. ASX is ubiquitous in nature, especially found in the marine environment asa red-orange pigment common to many aquatic animals such as salmonids, shrimp, and crayﬁsh.ASX is primarily biosynthesized by microalgae/phytoplankton, accumulating in zooplankton andcrustaceans and subsequently in ﬁsh, from where it is added to the higher levels in the food chain.Although ASX can be also synthesized by plants, bacteria, and microalgae, the chlorophyte algaHaematococcus pluvialis is considered to have the highest capacity to accumulate ASX [ 2]. It is worth
mentioning that currently, 95% of ASX available in the market is produced synthetically usingpetrochemicals due to cost-efﬁciency for mass production. Safety issues have arisen regarding theuse of synthetic ASX for human consumption, while the ASX derived from H. pluvialis is the mainsource for several human applications, including dietary supplements, cosmetics, and food. There areseveral ASX stereoisomers in nature ((3S, 3′S), (3R, 3′R), and (3R, 3′S)) that differ in the conﬁgurationof the two hydroxyl groups on the molecule. The predominant form found in H. pluvialis and insalmon species is the stereoisomer form 3S, 3′S [3]. In addition, ASX has several essential biologicalfunctions in marine animals, including pigmentation, protection against ultraviolet (UV) light effects,Nutrients 2018 ,10, 522; doi:10.3390/nu10040522 www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients
Nutrients 2018 ,10, 522 2 of 12communication, immune response, reproductive capacity, stress tolerance, and protection againstoxidation of macromolecules [ 4]. ASX is strictly related to other carotenoids, such as zeaxanthin,lutein, and β-carotene; therefore, it shares numerous metabolic and physiological functions attributedto carotenoids. However, ASX is more bioactive than zeaxanthin, lutein, and β-carotene. This is mainlydue to the presence of a keto- and a hydroxyl group on each end of its molecule. Moreover, unlike othercarotenoids, ASX is not converted into vitamin A. Because of its molecular structure, ASX has uniquefeatures that support its potential use in promoting human health. In particular, the polar end groupsquench free radicals, while the double bonds of its middle segment remove high-energy electrons.These unique chemical properties explain some of its features, particularly a higher antioxidant
activity than other carotenoids [ 5]. In addition, ASX preserves the integrity of cell membranes byinserting itself in their bilayers, protects the redox state and functional integrity of mitochondria,and demonstrates beneﬁts mostly at a very modest dietary intake, since its strongly polar natureoptimizes the rate and extent of its absorption [ 6,7]. Recently, ASX has attracted considerable interestbecause of its potential pharmacological effects, including anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inﬂammatory,and antioxidant activities as well as neuro-, cardiovascular, ocular, and skin-protective effects [ 8].In particular, ASX has been reported to exhibit multiple biological activities to preserve skin healthand achieve effective skin cancer chemoprevention [ 9]. Extensive research during the last two decadeshas revealed the mechanism by which continued oxidative stress leads to chronic inﬂammation, which
in turn, mediates most chronic diseases including cancer and skin damage [ 10,11]. In skin, ASX hasbeen shown to improve dermal health by direct and downstream inﬂuences at several differentsteps of the oxidative stress cascade, while inhibiting inﬂammatory mediators at the same time [ 12].Molecular and morphological changes in aged skin not only compromise its protective role, but alsocontribute to the appearance of skin symptoms, including excessive dryness and pruritus, as well asincreased predisposition to the formation or deepening of wrinkles, dyspigmentation, fragility anddifﬁculty in healing injuries, alteration in skin permeability to drugs, impaired ability to sense andrespond to mechanical stimuli, skin irritation, and tumor incidence [ 13,14]. The effects of ASX onhyperpigmentation suppression, melanin synthesis and photoaging inhibition, and wrinkle formationreduction have been reported in several clinical studies [ 15]. In the current review, we will address
some issues that highlight the overall versatility and protection offered by ASX. In particular, we willdiscuss the effects of ASX on cellular and molecular mechanisms, such as the regulation of antioxidantand anti-inﬂammatory activities, modulation of the immune response, prevention of skin damage,and regulation of DNA repair.2. Skin-Protective Mechanisms of Astaxanthin2.1. Antioxidant ActivityOxidative stress plays a crucial role in human skin aging and dermal damage. The mechanismsof intrinsic (chronological) and extrinsic (photo-) aging include the generation of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) via oxidative metabolism and exposure to sun ultraviolet (UV) light, respectively.Thus, the formation of ROS is a pivotal mechanism leading to skin aging. Oxidant events of skinaging involve damage to DNA, the inﬂammatory response, reduced production of antioxidants,and the generation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade collagen and elastin in the
dermal skin layer [ 16–18]. There are many dietary or exogenous sources that act as antioxidants,
and the generation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade collagen and elastin in thedermal skin layer [ 16–18]. There are many dietary or exogenous sources that act as antioxidants,including polyphenols and carotenoids [ 19,20]. ASX has recently caught the interest of researchersbecause of its powerful antioxidant activity and its unique molecular and biochemical messengerproperties with implications in treating and preventing skin disease. Comparative studies examiningthe photoprotective effects of carotenoids have demonstrated that ASX is a superior antioxidant,having greater antioxidant capacity than canthaxanthin and β-carotene in human dermal ﬁbroblasts.In particular, ASX inhibits ROS formation and modulates the expression of oxidative stress-responsiveenzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which is a marker of oxidative stress and a regulatory
Nutrients 2018 ,10, 522 3 of 12mechanism involved in the cell adaptation against oxidative damage [ 21]. HO-1 is regulated viavarious stress-sensitive transcription factors, including nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2),which binds to antioxidant response elements in the promoter regions of enzymes of the detoxifyingmetabolism [ 22]. Several authors demonstrated that ASX activates the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant pathwayby generating small amounts of ROS [ 23,24]. Consistent with these studies, Xue et al. [25] observedthat ASX upregulated Nrf2 expression in irradiated cells. Furthermore, the Nrf2-targeted proteinsHO-1 and antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), catalase (CAT), and glutathioneperoxidase 1 (GPX1) were signiﬁcantly upregulated in irradiated cells in the presence of ASX. Therefore,ASX exerts signiﬁcant antioxidant activities not only via direct radical scavenging, but also by activating
the cellular antioxidant defense system through modulation of the Nrf2 pathway. A recent study alsodemonstrated that ASX protected against early burn-wound progression by attenuating ROS-inducedoxidative stress in a rat deep-burn model. This effect involves the regulation of free radical productionby inﬂuencing xanthine oxidase (XO) and the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotidephosphate (NADPH) oxidase (Nox); both contribute to the generation of ROS [26].2.2. Anti-Inﬂammatory PropertiesExtensive research during the last two decades has revealed the mechanism by which continuedoxidative stress leads to chronic inﬂammation, which in turn, mediates most chronic diseasesincluding neurodegeneration, cancer, and skin damage [ 27–29]. It is well established that variousproinﬂammatory markers in skin are increased as a result of UV exposure. Keratinocytes play a crucialrole in the photodamage response after UV exposure by releasing proinﬂammatory mediators. It has
been shown that ASX treatment prevents the deleterious effects of UV by decreasing UV-inducedreactive nitrogen species production, inﬂammatory cytokine expression, and apoptosis in keratinocytes.ASX caused a signiﬁcant decrease in the levels of inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase(COX)-2, and decreased the release of prostaglandin E2 from keratinocytes after UV irradiation [ 30].The inhibitory effect of ASX on the production of iNOS has important implications for the developmentof anti-inﬂammatory drugs for skin inﬂammatory diseases such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD).AD is a chronic inﬂammatory skin disease associated with various factors, including immunologicalabnormalities that contribute to the pathogenesis and development of skin lesions. A recent reportshowed that ASX inhibited the gene expression of several proinﬂammatory biomarkers such asinterleukin-1 β(IL-1 β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor- α(TNF- α) in an AD animal
model [ 31]. Several investigators examined the inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF- κB) by ASX.In particular, ASX has been reported to have a potent capacity to block the nuclear translocationof the NF- κB p65 subunit and I κBαdegradation through its inhibitory effect on N κB kinase (IKK)activity [ 32]. More importantly, studies showed the ability of ASX to inhibit the production ofinﬂammatory mediators by blocking NF- κB activation in human keratinocytes, indicating that ASXmay offer an attractive new strategy for treating skin inﬂammatory diseases [33].2.3. Immune-Enhancing EffectsConsiderable evidence suggests that suppression of immune system contributes to thedevelopment of solar UV-induced cutaneous malignancies, including melanoma and non-melanoma,in both mouse models and humans [ 34–36]. ASX signiﬁcantly inﬂuences immune function inseveral in vitro and in vivo assays [ 37]. For example, in vitro studies on human lymphocytes have
demonstrated enhancement by ASX of immunoglobulin production in response to T cell-dependent
several in vitro and in vivo assays [ 37]. For example, in vitro studies on human lymphocytes havedemonstrated enhancement by ASX of immunoglobulin production in response to T cell-dependentstimuli [ 38]. The immunomodulatory action of ASX has been also reported in dogs and cats, enhancingboth cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. In these studies, ASX increased natural killer (NK)cell cytotoxic activity, suggesting that ASX may regulate NK cells that serve as an immunosurveillancesystem against tumours and virus-infected cells [ 39,40]. Moreover, other authors have shown thatASX increased cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity in mice. Activated T cells and NK cells produceinterferon- γ(IFN- γ), which is involved in immune regulation and B cell differentiation; therefore,
Nutrients 2018 ,10, 522 4 of 12ASX may enhance immune responses and potentially exert antitumor activity [ 41]. In addition tothe cell-mediated immune response, as already mentioned, ASX also stimulated humoral immunity.ASX increased antibody production in mouse splenocytes, restored humoral immune response inold mice, and induced production of polyclonal antibodies G and M in murine spleen cells [ 42–44].Although further studies are needed to better elucidate the speciﬁc mode of action of ASX in enhancingthe immune response, collectively, these observations suggest that ASX may be a potential tool againstUV-induced immunosuppression.2.4. Effects on Skin DamageThe most important and abundant structures of the dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) arecollagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). In both intrinsic and extrinsic aging, changes inthese structures are observed. These modiﬁcations lead to the loss of tensile strength and recoil capacity,
wrinkle formation, dryness, and impaired wound healing [ 45]. In addition, UV-induced ROS stimulatethe synthesis of MMPs that are responsible for the degradation of ECM, and in particular, MMPs canfully degrade collagen [ 46].In vitro , ASX effectively suppresses cell damage caused by free radicalsand induction of MMP-1 in skin after UV irradiation [ 47]. Some similar studies also reported that ASXinhibited the expression of MMPs in different cells, including macrophages and chondrocytes [ 48,49].Recently, an enriched ASX extract from H. pluvialis increased collagen content through inhibition ofMMP-1 and MMP-3 expression in human dermal ﬁbroblasts [ 50]. Moreover, it should be highlightedthat ECM deregulation may affect various essential cell behaviours. Indeed, the correct regulation ofMMPs is critical in controlling the balanced turnover of collagen and in maintaining ECM integrity and
function [ 51]. During wound healing, the ECM at the wound site undergoes dramatic reorganization.It has been shown that ASX is an effective compound for accelerating wound healing in full-thicknessdermal wounds in mice. ASX-treated wounds showed signiﬁcantly increased expression of woundhealing biological markers such as collagen type I α1 (Col1A1) and basic ﬁbroblast growth factor(bFGF) [52].2.5. Effects on DNA RepairThe exposure of the skin to UV radiation causes DNA damage. The biologically harmful effectsassociated with UV radiation exposure are largely the result of errors in DNA repair, which can lead tooncogenic mutations. The DNA photoproducts generated by UV-induced DNA damage are alteredDNA structures that activate a cascade of responses, beginning with the initiation of cell-cycle arrestand activation of DNA repair mechanisms [ 53]. The nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway is a key
mechanism utilized by mammalian cells for the repair of damaged DNA [ 54]. Although there are nostudies evaluating the effects of ASX on the NER pathway, ASX is reported to improve the DNA repaircapacity of cells exposed to UV radiation. In particular, ASX was capable of minimizing DNA damageand inﬂuencing the kinetics of DNA repair. [ 55]. Human cells possess multiple protection mechanismsagainst UV-induced ROS, either by preventing damage or by damage repair. For example, ASX inhibitsthe UV-induced DNA damage and increases the expression of oxidative stress-responsive enzymes [ 21].Moreover, ASX was shown to exert its protective effects against cyclophosphamide-induced oxidativestress and DNA damage by activating Nrf2 and modulating NQO1 and HO-1 expressions [ 56].Cyclophosphamide (CP), a cytotoxic alkylating agent, is extensively used in the treatment of variouscancers with high efﬁcacy. However, it exhibits severe cytotoxicity to normal cells in humans and
experimental animals, and it is associated with toxic effects and induction of genomic instability andDNA damage. Therefore, it is important to prevent normal cells from DNA damage induced by CP
experimental animals, and it is associated with toxic effects and induction of genomic instability andDNA damage. Therefore, it is important to prevent normal cells from DNA damage induced by CPin clinical applications. Several reports indicated that ASX decreased CP-induced oxidative stressand subsequent oxidative DNA damage [ 57,58]. Furthermore, the AKT pathway plays key roles inmodulating genome stability and DNA damage responses. Studies have shown that inhibition ofAKT kinase activity impairs double-strand break (DSB) repair [ 59]. Recently, it was suggested that
Nutrients 2018 ,10, 522 5 of 12modulation of the AKT signal pathway by ASX may potentially contribute to the maintenance ofgenomic stability and counteract DNA damage [60].3. Evidence from Human Clinical TrialsBoth in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that ASX may play a promising functionalrole to treat and prevent skin aging. Although ASX displayed molecular and protective mechanisms ofaction to promote and/or improve human skin health, it may not be easy to translate these resultsto humans. Methodological pitfalls afﬂicting in vitro experiments and animal models need to beconsidered for the interpretation of these results. In addition, the source of ASX used in cell culture andanimal studies is often of unknown origin. However, the potential skin-protective effects of ASX havealso been investigated in humans. The main source of ASX intake in humans is from seafood, with wild
sockeye salmon, for example, providing 26–38 mg/kg of ﬂesh [ 61]. Human intervention studies thathave been conducted with ASX are summarized in Table 1. Immune cells are extremely vulnerableto uncontrolled free radical production due to a high percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids intheir membranes, and they produce more oxidative products and inﬂammatory mediators [ 62,63].Park et al. [64] conducted the ﬁrst comprehensive study to investigate the action of dietary ASX inmodulating immune response, oxidative status, and inﬂammation in young healthy adult femalehuman subjects. After eight weeks of supplementation, ASX enhanced both cell-mediated and humoralimmune responses, including T cell and B cell mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation, NK cellcytotoxic activity, and IL-6 production. ASX did not inﬂuence the concentration of plasma C-reactiveproteins, but levels of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) (a DNA damage biomarker) were
dramatically lower in the group fed higher doses of ASX. All of the skin aging characteristics areassociated with the oxidative metabolism and subsequent ROS production that deﬁne this unavoidablephenomenon. In a recent study, it was demonstrated that continuous consumption of ASX for fourweeks alleviated aging-related changes of residual skin surface components (RSSC). The authorsalso measured the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a recognized biomarker of systemic oxidativestress. In particular, 31 middle-aged subjects received 4-mg daily doses of ASX, and the plasmalevels of MDA decreased during ASX consumption (by 11.2% on day 15 and by 21.7% on day 29).Moreover, the analysis of RSSC samples revealed decreased levels of corneocyte desquamation andmicrobial presence at the end of the study [ 65].Tominaga et al. [66] conducted an in vitro study and inparallel, a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study with 65 healthy female
subjects for 16 weeks to verify the effects of oral ASX supplementation (6 or 12 mg) on skin integrity.The authors demonstrated that pre- and post-treatment with ASX dose-dependently decreased thesecretion of inﬂammatory cytokines and MMP-1 from UVB-irradiated keratinocytes. Furthermore,the clinical study demonstrated that skin moisture content and deep wrinkles were not signiﬁcantlychanged in the ASX-supplemented groups, whereas these parameters signiﬁcantly worsened in theplacebo group during the study period. Interestingly, IL-1 αlevels in the stratum corneum weremaintained only in the high-dose group. In addition, skin elasticity improvements were observedin the high-dose group compared with that of the placebo group in participants with high skinmoisture content. In 2001, Seki et al. [67] conducted a small pilot study with ASX from H. pluvialisto investigate the wrinkle reduction effect on the skin of 45 healthy subjects. The authors observed
an antiwrinkle effect in female human subjects ( n= 3), using a topical cream containing ASX combined
an antiwrinkle effect in female human subjects ( n= 3), using a topical cream containing ASX combinedwith other active ingredients. A dermatological assessment revealed signiﬁcant reduction of wrinklesand pufﬁness on the lower eye and cheeks after two weeks of use. A second preliminary humanstudy performed by Yamahita in 1995 [ 68] showed in healthy male subjects ( n= 7) that topical naturalASX from krill signiﬁcantly reduces erythema by 60% at 98 h after UV-B exposure. In a second study,the same author administered to 49 healthy female subjects (mean age of 47 years) 2 mg of ASX orplacebo. After six weeks of treatment, signiﬁcant improvements were observed in skin moisture andelasticity [ 69]. In another study by Tominaga et al. [70] , the effect of ASX on wrinkle reduction andskin elasticity was investigated in 28 female subjects (20–55 years). The combined use of a dietary
Nutrients 2018 ,10, 522 6 of 12supplement and a topical product containing ASX for eight weeks showed a reduction in the overallaverage wrinkle depth. The latest trend in antiaging strategies is to use a combination of dietary andoral supplements to produce extra physiologic beneﬁts [71–74] . Several studies demonstrated that thecombined administration of ASX with other compounds, particularly collagen hydrolysate, may showadditive or synergistic effects for preventing or reversing the skin aging process [ 75,76]. Consistent withthis, a recent study with 44 healthy subjects showed that a combination of ASX ( 2 mg/day ) and collagenhydrolysate ( 2 mg/day ) for 12 weeks improves elasticity and barrier integrity in human skin. Theseimprovements were associated with molecular changes such as the induction of procollagen type I anddecreased levels in the expression of the collagen-degrading enzyme MMP-1 and the elastin-degrading
enzyme MMP-12 [ 77]. In an open-label noncontrolled study, 30 healthy female subjects received foreight weeks 6 mg per day of oral supplementation combined with 2 mL (78.9- µM solution) per dayof a topical application of ASX. Signiﬁcant improvements were observed in skin wrinkle, age spotsize, elasticity, and skin texture [ 15]. The same authors also conducted a randomized double-blindplacebo-controlled study involving 36 healthy male subjects supplemented with 6 mg of ASX for sixweeks. At the end of the study period, ASX improved wrinkles, elasticity, transepidermal water loss(TEWL), moisture content, and sebum oil level [ 15]. These results demonstrate that ASX may improveskin condition in both men and women. Further evidence from human intervention studies is required.In addition, we recommend additional research focused on stimulation of the endogenous antioxidantdefense systems of the skin, particularly the expression of antioxidant responsive elements associated
with the activity of detoxifying enzymes.Table 1.

SafetyASX sourced from the microalgae H. pluvialis has been approved as a color additive in salmon feedsand as a dietary supplement for human consumption in Europe, Japan, and the USA. The EuropeanFood Safety Authority (EFSA) on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed(FEEDAP) advised an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.034 mg/kg bw of ASX (2.38 mg per dayina 70-kg human ) [78,79]. This scientiﬁc opinion was reiterated later by an EFSA Panel on DieteticProducts, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA), where it was concluded that the safety of 4 mg of ASXper day (0.06 mg/kg bw) had yet to be fully established [ 78]. However, no adverse effects werereported in studies involving participants supplemented with more than 4 mg per day of ASX [ 80,81].For example, the acute intake of 40 mg of ASX has also been reported as well-tolerated in 32 healthy
participants with only three mild events reported in the 48 h post-intake [ 82]. Also, the chronicintake of 16 and 40 mg per day of ASX has been suggested as safe in patients suffering with functionaldyspepsia [ 83]. It is also worth mentioning that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approvedASX from H. pluvialis for direct human consumption dosages up to 12 mg per day and up to 24 mg perday for no more than 30 days [ 61]. In addition, supercritical CO 2extracts from H. pluvialis have beengranted “novel food” status by the FDA and recognized as “GRAS” status (generally recognized assafe) [3].4.2. BioavailabilityFollowing release from the food matrix, carotenoids accumulate in the lipid droplets within thegastric juices and then are incorporated into micelles. These micelles diffuse into the plasma membraneof enterocytes, and carotenoids are transported in the circulation by high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) [ 84]. The absorption of ASX and other carotenoids is inﬂuencedby their chemical properties and several dietary and non-dietary-related parameters [ 85]. The ASXcontent of salmon ﬂesh ranges from 3 to 37 mg/kg; therefore, a 200-g serving of salmon providesapproximately 1 to 7 mg of ASX. Wild salmon contains the 3S, 3′S form of ASX almost exclusively [ 80].The absorption of ASX is affected by diet and by smoking, and in particular, concomitant foodintake appears to increase the absorption and smoking appears to reduce the half-life of ASX [ 86].The absorption of ASX from different sources has been investigated in several animal species, includingmice, rats, dogs, and humans. In a randomized and double-blind trial, 28 healthy men consumed 250 gof wild or aquacultured salmon daily for four weeks, which provided 5 mg ASX/day from salmonﬂesh. Following six days of intervention with wild salmon (3S, 3′S isomer), plasma ASX concentrations
reached a plateau of 39 nmol/L, and of 52 nmol/L after administration of aquacultured salmon(3R, 3′S). Interestingly, at days 3, 6, 10, and 14, but not at day 28, the ASX concentrations in humanplasma were signiﬁcantly greater after ingestion of aquacultured salmon. First, these results suggestthat the ASX isomer pattern in human plasma resembles that of the ingested salmon. Then, it seemsthat when the intake of ASX is chronic, maximal concentrations can be achieved within the ﬁrstweek of intake, even when ASX is obtained from different sources [ 87]. Although the bioavailabilityand the conﬁgurational isomer distribution of the ASX in human plasma has been investigated inthis clinical trial, a comprehensive study regarding the pharmacokinetics and tissue distributionof ASX in human skin has not been performed. Carotenoids are lipid-soluble molecules, and theabsorption of ASX is inﬂuenced positively by dietary lipids. It appears that a higher proportion of ASX
is absorbed when is delivered in an oil-based formulation. In an open parallel study, eight healthy male
is absorbed when is delivered in an oil-based formulation. In an open parallel study, eight healthy malevolunteers received a single dose of 40 mg of ASX as three different lipid-based formulations ( n= 8 foreach group). All three lipid-based formulations enhanced the bioavailability of ASX, but the highestbioavailability was observed with the formulation containing the highest content of the hydrophilicsynthetic surfactant. Therefore, these results suggest that ASX should be consumed together withdietary fats to optimize bioavailability [ 82]. Considering the small number of subjects included in these
Nutrients 2018 ,10, 522 8 of 12bioavailability studies, future research should try to replicate these ﬁndings in doses equivalent to thoseadvised by the different authorities such as the EFSA and FDA. The limited literature evidence devotedto showing improvements in ASX bioavailability reveals that the enhancement of ASX bioavailabilityhas not gained signiﬁcant attention, especially for skin tissue. Moreover, novel delivery strategiesincluding various type of formulations such as nanoparticles, topical application cream, and deﬁnedphospholipid complexes offer signiﬁcant promise and are worthy of further exploration in attempts toenhance the bioavailability of this interesting molecule.5. ConclusionsThe main components that confer an aged skin appearance are damaged structural andfunctional proteins that form the ECM. Damage to these structures leads to the production of reactive
intermediates, cell death, and inﬂammatory responses. Moreover, UV irradiation signiﬁcantly inducespigmentation, skin wrinkling, and immunosuppression, resulting in the acceleration of photoaging.UV-induced damage of DNA can lead to mutations, apoptosis, or malignant transformations of cells.Although there is no health claim or therapeutic indication approved by the EFSA or FDA, ASX hasa great potential in the global market of nutraceuticals. In this article, we have provided an overviewof the cytoprotective mechanisms of ASX. Due to its involvement in diverse biological activities, ASX isa promising compound in the ﬁeld of dermatology. Additional, more comprehensive experimentswill be necessary in order to fully understand ASX activities in the skin. However, ASX inhibitscollagenases, MMP activity, inﬂammatory mediators, and ROS induction, resulting in potentantiwrinkle and antioxidant effects. Moreover, ASX may prevent UV-induced immunosuppression.
Toxicological aspects have been characterized and ASX appears to be a safe and bioavailable compound.Some clinical studies have shown a relationship between the intake of ASX and positive effects oncutaneous physiology; however, a lot of unknown topics need to be further investigated.Acknowledgments: We thank group members of Solgar Italia Multrinutrient S.p.A. for their thorough review andhelpful discussions during the preparation of this manuscript and for their help in elaborating the search strategy.Author Contributions: All authors wrote the paper.Conﬂicts of Interest: The authors declare no conﬂict of interest.References1.
