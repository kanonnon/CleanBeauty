PolyphenolsabstractUltraviolet radiation absorbed by the epidermis is the major cause of various cutaneous disorders, includ-ing photoaging and skin cancers. Although topical sunscreens may offer proper skin protection, dietaryplant compounds may signiﬁcantly contribute to lifelong protection of skin health, especially whenunconsciously sun UV exposed. A combination of rosemary and citrus bioﬂavonoids extracts was usedto inhibit UV harmful effects on human HaCaT keratinocytes and in human volunteers after oral intake.Survival of HaCaT cells after UVB radiation was higher in treatments using the combination of extractsthan in those performed with individual extracts, indicating potential synergic effects. The combinationof extracts also decreased UVB-induced intracellular radical oxygen species (ROS) and prevented DNAdamage in HaCaT cells by comet assay and decreased chromosomal aberrations in X-irradiated human
lymphocytes. The oral daily consumption of 250 mg of the combination by human volunteers revealeda signiﬁcant minimal erythema dose (MED) increase after eight weeks (34%, p< 0.05). Stronger protectionwas achieved after 12 weeks (56%, p< 0.01). The combination of citrus ﬂavonoids and rosemary polyphe-nols and diterpenes may be considered as an ingredient for oral photoprotection. Their mechanism ofaction may deserve further attention./C2112014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionUV radiation from the sun induces several harmful responses,including erythema, immunosuppression, edema, sunburn, hyper-plasia, hyperpigmentation, premature aging and skin cancer. OnlyUVA (320–400 nm) and UVB (280–320 nm) are harmful to ourskin. UVA accounts for more than 90% of the total UV radiationreaching us and is constant throughout the year, but UVB photonsare one thousand times more capable of causing sunburn than UVA
and increase considerably in the summer [1]. UVA is thought toplay a crucial role in photoaging and causes epidermal hyperplasia,stratum corneum thickening and the synthesis of inﬂammatorycytokines and metalloproteinases (MMPs) [2,3] . Meanwhile, UVBcauses sunburn, sun tanning, pigmented spots and wrinkles andaccelerates skin aging.Both UVA and UVB contribute signiﬁcantly to photoaging. Photo-aging is the superposition of chronic UV-induced damage on intrin-sic skin aging and accounts for most age-related changes in skinappearance [4]. The molecular mechanism of photoaging is mostlytriggered by ROS-mediated activation of cell surface receptors lead-ing to stimulation of stress-associated kinase pathways, which aremediated by protein 1 (AP-1) nuclear transcription factor [5]. Thisfactor prompts prostaglandin release, keratinocyte proliferationand a loss of collagen synthesis [6]. ROS also lead to the activationof NF-
of NF-jB transcription factor, which induces the expression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and metaloproteinases (MMPs). Finally,ROS-induced mitochondrial DNA deletions compromise mitochon-
of NF-jB transcription factor, which induces the expression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and metaloproteinases (MMPs). Finally,ROS-induced mitochondrial DNA deletions compromise mitochon-drial function [4]. All these factors together with direct protein oxi-dation contribute to accelerate extracellular matrix degradation.Although UVA is suspected to play a major role in photoaging,UVB activates AP-1 and causes direct DNA damage, inﬂammation,immunosuppression, angiogenesis and elastin degradation.Major protective systems in human skin cells are the naturalpigment melanin, which absorbs and scatters UV radiation, andhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2014.04.0071011-1344/ /C2112014 Elsevier B.V.

skin cells’ antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutaseand glutathione peroxidase) [4]. Moreover, p53 protein plays a cru-cial role in UVB protection, acting as a transcription factor that con-trols genes involved in the cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair [7].Human skin is inadvertently exposed to approximately 2/3 of thecumulative erythemal ultraviolet (UV) dose/year when no topicalprotection is used [8]. Therefore, beyond topical sunscreen protec-tion when consciously exposed [9], photoprotection by dietarycompounds via endogenous delivery to the skin may signiﬁcantlycontribute to lifelong protection of skin health. Several plant phyto-chemicals have been found to be effective in preventing UV-inducedDNA oxidative damage through a ROS scavenging mechanismin vitro and in animal models [1]. Rosmarinic acid [10–12] , a pheno-lic acid derivative, the isoﬂavone genistein [13] and silibin frommilk thistle [14] have exhibited skin protective effects against
UVB-induced ROS on mice and cell models through p53 activationand decreased DNA damage. Chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyﬂavone) atten-uates apoptosis, ROS generation and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)expression and diminishes aquaporin-3 downregulation inducedby UVB and UVA [15]. Rosemary diterpenes display strong in vitroantioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory effects, together with in vivoskin protective effects [16–18] , and forskolin protects keratinocytesfrom UVB-induced apoptosis independently of melanin content[19].In the present study, a speciﬁc combination of a rosemaryextract, enriched in polyphenols and diterpenes, and a citrus bioﬂ-avonoid extract, containing ﬂavonoids, was used for the ﬁrst time toinhibit UVB’s harmful effects on human keratinocytes. The capacityof this combination to decrease UVB-mediated cell death, ROS for-mation and DNA damage in human keratinocytes, and genotoxicityinduced by X-rays in human lymphocytes, was assessed. A human
intervention study using 250 mg of this combination by oral admin-istration for three months was also established to determine thecapacity of the ingredient to increase the minimal erythema dose(MED) of the volunteers upon UV exposure.2. Materials and methods2.1. MaterialsThe human keratinocytes HaCaT (a spontaneously immortal-ized cell line) were obtained from CLS Cell Lines Service GmbH(Eppelheim, Germany). Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium(DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin–streptomycinwere obtained from Gibco/C210(Life Technologies Co., Europe). Phyto-hemagglutinin, cytochalasin B (Cyt B) and the rest of the reagentswere purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Europe).2.2. ExtractsHerbal extracts were kindly provided by Monteloeder, Inc. Cit-rus extract, obtained from immature grapefruit, was enriched incitrus bioﬂavonoids as declared by the manufacturer and showeda phenolic content of 22.57 ± 2.65 expressed as GAE (gallic acid
equivalents)/100 g dry weight (dw). The rosemary extract con-tained phenolic compounds and diterpenes, as declared, and a phe-nolic content of 57.16 ± 1.25 GAE/100 g dw was determined. Thecombination of extracts (NutroxSun/C210) used in the cellular assaysand the human intervention study contained the two extracts ata 1:1 ratio and had a phenolic content of 36.32 ± 3.91 GAE/100 gdw. Powered extracts were stored at RT under controlled humidityconditions in a desiccator. Rosemary extract was dissolved intosterile distilled water and citrus extract and the combination weredissolved into DMSO at desired concentrations. Solutions weresterile ﬁltered and freshly prepared for every cellular assay.2.3.

penicillin–streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml penicillin and 100 U/mlstreptomycin) in a humidiﬁed atmosphere with CO 2(5% v/v) at37/C176C. The HaCaT cells were trypsinized every third day, followingthe manufacturer’s instructions, and seeded in 96- or six-well plates,depending on the assay.2.4. Treatment of cells, UVB irradiation and MTT survival assayCells were cultured in 96-well plates and maintained in med-ium for 24 h. For treatments, cells at 50–70% conﬂuence werewashed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treated withPBS containing the selected extract (12.5–100 lg/ml, no toxicitywas observed at these concentrations), followed by treatment withUVB light emitted from a Bio-Link Crosslinker BLX-E312 (VilberLourmat, France) at 800 or 1200 J/m2[20]. Afterward, the PBSwas replaced with fresh medium, and the cells were incubatedfor 72 h for viability assays or for 2 h for comet or ROS assays.The MTT assay was used for determining cellular viability [21].
The cell protection level was calculated as the percentage of cellviability recovered under a certain condition, where 100% wasthe difference between non-irradiated cells and irradiated cells inthe absence of the extract.2.5. Total phenolic content determinationTotal polyphenolic content was determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu method, using gallic acid as the standard [22,23] .2.6. ROS generation evaluation20,70-Dichlorodihydroﬂuorescein diacetate (H 2DCFDA) (Molecu-lar probes/C210, Life Technologies Co., Europe) was used to monitorthe intracellular ROS generation induced by UVB radiation [21].Promptly, cells were cultured in a 96-well black plate until 90–100% conﬂuence was reached. The cells were then treated with athin layer of PBS containing the combined extract (75–100 lg/ml),followed by treatment with UVB light (800 or 1200 J/m2) andlabeled with H 2DCFDA.2.7. Single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay)
Comet assay was essentially performed as previously reported[11]. A total of 50 nuclei by duplicate were utilized for determina-tion of Comet score. The gels were analyzed by ﬂuorescencemicroscopy (Nikon Eclipse TE2000U). DNA damage was quantiﬁedas described in Supplementary information section.2.8. Cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (CBMN) assay and genotoxicityHuman whole blood samples were obtained and treated in thepresence and in the absence of the extracts and exposed to 2 Gydoses of X-rays (see Supplementary information for details). AfterX-irradiation, the micronucleus assay was performed on the irradi-ated lymphocytes using a reported CBMN method [24,25] , adaptedby the International Atomic Energy Agency (2011).2.9. Human intervention studyThe human intervention assay was developed on 10 healthyhuman volunteers by EVIC HISPANIA, Centro Experimental deEvaluación Cutánea, S.L. (Spain) to study the protective activity of
the combination (NutroxSun/C210) after oral ingestion by the calcula-tion of MED at different times (reference code 10-0266/0).A. Pérez-Sánchez et al. / Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology 136 (2014) 12–18 13
The compliance of the product with the European regulations inforce was guaranteed after reviewing the procedure, undertakingletter, informed consent and previous documentation on the testedproduct (see Supplementary information for details).2.10. Statistical analysisThe data were expressed as the mean ± SD of 4–8 determina-tions, depending on the assay. One-way analysis of variance(ANOVA) and statistical comparisons of the different treatmentswere performed using Tukey’s test in GraphPad Prism version 5.0(GraphPad Software). In the CBMN study, the degree of depen-dence and correlation between variables was assessed usingANOVA complemented by a contrast of means ( p< 0.05). Forhuman intervention study, a Student’s ttest for paired series wasused.3. Results and discussion3.1. Effects of the combined extract and its individual components onthe viability of HaCaT cells exposed to UVBTo study the protective effects of citrus and rosemary extracts
and that of their combination, HaCaT cell viability after UVB irradi-ation (800 or 1200 J/m2dose) in the presence of the extracts, wasdetermined using the MTT assay ( Fig. 1 ). At 800 J/m2, the presenceof citrus extract steadily increased cell protection until saturationobserved approximately at 50 lg/ml ( Fig. 1 A). A level of maximumprotection of approximately 40% was reached compared with acontrol irradiated in the absence of the extract. When the UVB dosewas increased to 1200 J/m2, protection gradually increased withextract concentration until reaching a similar level of protection,i.e., 50%, but at higher concentrations (100 lg/ml). Rosemaryextract exerted a lower level of protection than citrus extract, espe-cially at high radiation dose ( Fig. 1 B). Levels of protection of 30%and 13% were observed at 800 and 1200 J/m2, respectively, at themaximum extract concentration assayed (100 lg/ml).The dissimilar polyphenolic compositions of citrus and rose-
mary extracts might provide with complementary protectivemechanisms by reaching different cellular targets. To test thishypothesis, a mixture at a 1:1 ratio was evaluated in UV protectionassays, as previously described, in a concentration range of 12.5–100lg/ml ( Fig. 1 C). The combination showed a higher level of pro-tection at all concentrations compared with individual citrus orrosemary extracts. When cells were exposed to 800 J/m2, the com-bined extracts promoted a signiﬁcant level of protection upon anincrease in extract concentration, reaching a protection level of70% at the highest concentration used. At 1200 J/m2, the combina-tion was also extremely potent and reached a nearly 60%protection level at 100 lg/ml compared with cells irradiated inthe absence of it. When protection levels were compared at800 J/m2(Supplementary Table 1 ), citrus and rosemary extractsat 50 lg/ml accomplished 40% and 13% protection, respectively
(a theoretical additive effect of 53%). However, the combinedextract achieved 70% protection at 100 lg/ml (which contained50lg/ml of each extract). These results indicate that the combina-tion of citrus and rosemary extracts provided stronger protectiveeffects in the cell model than the sum of the formulation’s separatecomponents. An even more striking result was observed when cellswere irradiated with a 1200 J/m2dose. The combination achieved60% protection at 100 lg/ml, whereas individual citrus and rose-mary extracts at 50 lg/ml accomplished 13% and 5%, respectively.Detailed protection percentages for every concentration andextract are shown in Supplementary Table 1 . These results stronglysupport the hypothesis that both extracts act synergistically inphotoprotection since the combination exhibited better protectionresults than the sum of the effects of the individual components.Synergic effects have been previously described for plant polyphe-
nols in order to explain abnormally enhanced antimicrobial, anti-
results than the sum of the effects of the individual components.Synergic effects have been previously described for plant polyphe-nols in order to explain abnormally enhanced antimicrobial, anti-oxidant and hypotriglyceridemic activities [21,26] .The rosemary polyphenols rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid andcarnosol have been postulated to be effective agents for attenuat-ing cell-damaging effects against UV radiation and also ionizingradiation [10–12,27,28] . Moreover, naringenin, a citrus bioﬂavo-noid, was able to increase the survival of UVB-irradiated keratino-cytes [29]. Nevertheless, the current study is the ﬁrst one to reportthe synergic effect between these plant compounds. Rosemary andcitrus polyphenols show a signiﬁcant absorption within UVB range,so it seems reasonable to assume that part of their protective effectis based on a direct absorption and scattering of UVB radiation.Nevertheless, since some of these compounds may rapidly reach
intracellular targets, we propose that they may be able to scavengesuperoxide radical anions (O 2/C5-), hydroxyl radicals (/C5OH) and lipop-eroxy radicals (R–OO.), which subsequently generate DNA damageand protein oxidation. Due to these preliminary results in a cellmodel, the combined extract was selected for further assays inwhich the formulation’s capability to attenuate speciﬁc harmfuleffects related to photoaging, such as ROS generation and DNAdamage, were analyzed.3.2. Antioxidant activity and attenuation of ROS generation in UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells by rosemary and citrus combined extractIntracellular ROS are one of the most damaging effects of bothUVB and UVA radiations on skin, with subsequent damage to lipids,proteins and mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Both citrus bioﬂavo-noids and rosemary compounds have well-documented ROS-scav-enging capacity in several models, including human skin cells.

Naringenin inhibits apoptosis and pyrimidine dimers upon UVBradiation [29]. Several rosemary compounds have shown a potentradical-scavenging capacity, primarily against lipid peroxidation[16], and the prevention of UV-induced ROS generation and MMPexpression by carnosic acid has been reported [30].To study the potential protective effect of the combination ofextracts on the intracellular ROS generation induced by UVB radi-ation, cells were exposed to UVB at an 800 or 1200 J/m2dose in thepresence of two different concentrations of the combined extract.ROS generation was then measured with H 2DCFDA, a ﬂuorescentprobe that becomes ﬂuorescent when oxidized by free radicalsand that is especially sensitive to H 2O2,/C5OH and peroxynitrite atthe intracellular level [31].Fig. 2 shows the ROS generation inHaCaT cells after UVB radiation in the absence and in the presence
of various concentrations of the combined extract. As observed, acertain ﬂuorescence signal was observed due to basal metabolismof HaCaT cells in the absence of irradiation and extract supplemen-tation (black bar). When cells were irradiated either with 800 J/m2or 1200 J/m2in the absence of the extract, ﬂuorescence signalshowed a signiﬁcant increase of 36% and 62%, respectively, com-pared with basal condition (0%) due to UVB-induced ROS genera-tion ( p< 0.001). Although UVA is more effective in inducingoxidative damage [4], these results strongly demonstrate thatUVB is able to produce ROS species at intracellular level in cellmodel. In contrast, when cells were irradiated with 800 J/m2inthe presence the combined extract, ﬂuorescence intensitydecreased signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.001) as concentration increased com-pared to irradiated and non-treated cells, i.e., 42% ROS decrease at75lg/ml and 50% ROS decrease at 100 lg/ml of the combined
extract. The capacity of the combination to inhibit ROS generationwas even stronger at 1200 J/m2UVB dose, showing 64% ROSdecrease at 75 lg/ml and 71% ROS decrease at 100 lg/ml of thecombination compared to irradiated and non-treated cells. Besidesthe evident UVB absorption capacity of the polyphenols present inthe combination, these results clearly indicate that an additionalmechanism of the combined extract photoprotective propertiesmay be related to its capacity to decrease the generation of intra-cellular radical species such as H 2O2,/C5OH or peroxynitrite, whichhave been directly linked to DNA oxidative damage [32].3.3. Effects of the combined extract on UVB-induced DNA damageTo conﬁrm the hypothesis that inhibition of UV-inducedintracellular ROS was concomitant with a certain level of DNAprotection, we studied the level of nuclear DNA damage in individ-ual cells exposed to UVB using the comet assay. Fig. 3 shows rep-
resentative pictures of the effect of combined extract on cometelectrophoresis gels for HaCaT cells that were either irradiated at1200 J/m2or non-irradiated and the corresponding gels’ quantiﬁ-cation. The incubation of human keratinocytes with 100 lg/ml ofcombined extract did not signiﬁcantly affect the comet score whencells were not irradiated ( Fig. 3 C) compared with the control(Fig. 3 B), indicating the absence of genotoxicity for the extract.When control cells were irradiated, the comet score increased con-siderably ( Fig. 3 D) indicating an increased DNA damage. In con-trast, the presence of 100 lg/ml of the combined extract ( Fig. 3 E)signiﬁcantly reduced the DNA damage ( p< 0.05), i.e., by 26% com-pared with irradiated and untreated cells. Therefore, our resultsreveal that the combination of rosemary and citrus extracts candecrease the number of UV-induced DNA breaks and hence eitherattenuates the genotoxic effects of UV radiation or protects the
DNA repair machinery.UVB acts on the epidermal basal cell layer of the skin; isabsorbed by chromophores (such as DNA, RNA, proteins and mel-anin); and has been experimentally demonstrated to cause DNA
UVB acts on the epidermal basal cell layer of the skin; isabsorbed by chromophores (such as DNA, RNA, proteins and mel-anin); and has been experimentally demonstrated to cause DNAdamage, pyrimidine dimers, 8-OHdG formation, p53 induction,protein oxidation and the generation of ROS [33,34] . Incorrectrepair of these lesions leads to mutations, which may cause thedevelopment of cancer cells [35]. The excited oxygen electrons ofthe ROS induced by UVB alter the red/ox state of the cell and alsodamage mitochondria, inducing apoptosis and tissue injury andcontributing to altered cell growth and differentiation or to thedevelopment of skin cancer [33,36] . Considering all of the abovementioned in vitro evidence, i.e., the cell survival increase andthe decrease in intracellular ROS generation and DNA damage bythe combined extract, we suggest that the combination of rose-mary and citrus extracts may be able to attenuate further majorevents leading to photoaging and skin cancer.
events leading to photoaging and skin cancer.3.4. The genoprotective effects of combined extract against X-ray-induced ROS and DNA damageIonizing radiation generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen spe-cies within minutes of exposing cells to radiation, leading to com-promised mitochondria viability, MAPK pathways activation andDNA damage [37]. Therefore, we have used X-ray as a model to testwhether the combination of the extracts would be able to protectagainst a massive generation of radical species induced by X-rayexposure through micronuclei (MN) measurement.Human whole-blood samples were X-ray-irradiated in the pres-ence or absence of combined extract, and the number of lympho-cytes bearing MN was determined after cell culture. When wholeblood was exposed to 2 Gy in the absence of the combined extract,the number of lymphocytes bearing MN increased considerablycompared with non-irradiated cells ( Fig. 4 ). In contrast, combined
extract caused a signiﬁcant reduction of MN/500 CB frequency(p< 0.001) when administered either before or after irradiation(Fig. 4 ) compared with irradiated and non-treated cells. The pro-tection factor exhibited a value of 39% protection when the com-bined extract was utilized before irradiation and 32% protectionwhen the combined extract was used immediately after irradia-tion. These results agree with those obtained in the comet assayand corroborate the genoprotective and antimutagenic capacityof rosemary and citrus extracts combination against both UV-induced DNA damage and X-ray-induced ROS/RNS formation andsubsequent chromosomal damage. The mechanism of this protec-tion is most likely based on the capacity of the compounds presentin the combination to scavenge the massive number of free radicalsgenerated by X-ray, which leads to chromosomal aberrations.It has been postulated that both hydrophilic and lipophilic

The black bar indicates the ﬂuorescence signal under basalconditions in the absence of irradiation (0%)./C3/C3/C3(p< 0.001) indicates signiﬁcantdifferences compared with irradiated cells at the same UVB dose in the absence ofthe extract combination.A.

antioxidants from rosemary protect human lymphocytes fromgamma-radiation when added before irradiation due to theircapacity to eliminate the massive generation of superoxide anionand hydroxyl radicals upon irradiation. Interestingly, only oil-solu-ble antioxidants such as rosemary diterpenes seem to protect afterirradiation probably due to their capacity to inhibit lipid peroxida-tive processes leading to chromosomal oxidative damage [27,28] .Therefore, we propose that the lipophilic antioxidants are themajor contributors to DNA protective effect after irradiation, andthat both, hydrophilic polyphenols and lipophilic antioxidants,contribute to the increased protection when added beforeirradiation.3.5. Human intervention study resultsTo test the photoprotective efﬁcacy of the combined extract,a human intervention study was performed by the oraladministration to volunteers for whom the MED was determined
after exposure to UV radiation. Details of the study protocol andMED variation results are described in the materials and Supple-mentary sections. None of the volunteers discontinued oraladministration, so no exclusions were considered. The averageresults for MED variation during the trial are shown in Fig. 5 .No signiﬁcant differences in the MED value were by day 29thof consumption of combined extract compared with the initialvalues ( p= 0.429). In contrast, at the day 57th of treatment, a sig-niﬁcant increase in the MED was observed (34%, p< 0.05), indicat-ing that after approx. eight weeks of oral ingestion of thecombined extract, higher doses of UV radiation were needed tocause an erythematous skin reaction. The MED also increased after85 days of treatment (56%, p< 0.01), indicating that longer oraltreatments can improve UV protection effects. Long treatmentswith the supplement can most likely maintain steady-state
systemic concentrations of active metabolites that protect skincells from the inﬂammatory reaction appearing after UV radiation.Fig. 3. Rosemary and citrus combination decreases UVB-induced DNA strand break formation in HaCaT cells (A). Keratinocytes were treated with the combinati on (100 lg/ml)and exposed to UVB (1200 J/m2). To evaluate DNA damage, 50 cells (nuclei) per slide were analyzed. Total damage was expressed in arbitrary units and determined as describedin the materials and methods section.

Several studies have reported the capacity of dietary supple-ments to prevent UV-induced skin damage in human volunteers.The oral consumption of b-carotene (90 mg/d) for 24 weeksresulted in a modest increase in the MED [38,39] , as for high dailydoses of a-tocopherol (1000–3000 IU) and ascorbate (2–3 g)[40,41] . An increase in the MED by 15% after the consumption ofa combination of lycopene and a probiotic for six weeks has alsobeen reported [42]. A high dose of squalene (13.5–27 g/day) for90 days showed signiﬁcant effects on photoprotection after mea-surements of skin biopsies [43]. In contrast, a combination ofcarotenoids, vitamins C and E and proanthocyanidins did not showsigniﬁcant differences in the MED compared with a placebo, but asigniﬁcant decrease in MMP-1 and MMP-9 was observed in thegroup receiving the supplement [44]. Considering the reported
Folin values, daily dose of total polyphenols in the combinationused in the present human trial was approximately 100 mg, whichsupposes a very reasonable and safe antioxidants dose, and muchlower compared to most of the abovementioned studies. In moststudies on photoprotection based on nutritional ingredients, thereis a time frame of approximately 6–10 weeks until protectionagainst erythema becomes signiﬁcant [8]. This data that revealsrelatively long consumption periods is in agreement with ourresults, which show that the oral ingestion of a combination ofrosemary and citrus extracts for eight weeks provides improvedprotection against UV-induced erythema. The most likely reasonfor this behavior seems to be that skin biological turnover requiresseveral weeks to incorporate photoprotective nutrients.In conclusion, although rosemary and citrus extracts have indi-vidually demonstrated cellular protective properties against the
damaging radical species induced by UVB radiation, the extractcombination used in this study showed a synergistic behavior inincreasing the survival of human keratinocytes. The combinationdrastically decreased the generation of UVB-induced intracellularROS and was also capable of preventing UV-induced DNA damagein the comet assay, which may contribute to decrease the risk forfurther skin disorders. Combination also showed genoprotectiveand antimutagenic properties in a model for massive generationof radical species using ionizing radiation. Finally, the photoprotec-tive properties of this combination were corroborated in humanvolunteers through a 37% increase in the MED ( p< 0.05) after eightweeks of oral ingestion, and even stronger MED increase aftertwelve weeks (56%, p< 0.01). This study is the ﬁrst to show thatthe oral ingestion of a combination of rosemary and citrus extractscan reduce some molecular events related to skin photodamage,
such as intracellular ROS generation and DNA damage. The resultsmay contribute to understand how dietary polyphenols may pro-vide a skin protective effect against UV, further than the dailyuse of topical sunscreens.4.
