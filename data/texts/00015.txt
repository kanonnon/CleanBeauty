THE LANCET • Vol 354 • August 28, 1999 723S u m m a r yB a c k g r o u n dThe use of sunscreens on the skin can preventsunburn but whether long-term use can prevent skin cancer isnot known. Also, there is evidence that oral betacarotenesupplementation lowers skin-cancer rates in animals, butthere is limited evidence of its effect in human beings.M e t h o d sIn a community-based randomised trial with a 2 b y2 factorial design, individuals were assigned to fourtreatment groups: daily application of a sun protection factor15-plus sunscreen to the head, neck, arms, and hands, andbetacarotene supplementation (30 mg per day); sunscreenplus placebo tablets; betacarotene only; or placebo only.Participants were 1621 residents of Nambour in southeastQueensland, Australia. The endpoints after 4·5 years offollow-up were the incidence of basal-cell and squamous-cellcarcinomas both in terms of people treated for newlydiagnosed disease and in terms of the numbers of tumours
that occurred. Analysis of the effect of sunscreen was basedonly on skin cancers that developed on sites of dailyapplication. All analyses were by intention to treat.F i n d i n g s1383 participants underwent full skin examination bya dermatologist in the follow-up period. 250 of them developed758 new skin cancers during the follow-up period. There wereno significant differences in the incidence of first new skincancers between groups randomly assigned daily sunscreenand no daily sunscreen (basal-cell carcinoma 2588 v s2 5 0 9per 100 000; rate ratio 1·03 [95% CI 0·73–1·46]; squamous-cell carcinoma 876 v s996 per 100 000; rate ratio 0·88[0·50–1·56]). Similarly, there was no significant differencebetween the betacarotene and placebo groups in incidence ofeither cancer (basal-cell carcinoma 3954 v s3806 per1 00 000; 1·04 [0·73–1·27]; squamous-cell carcinoma 1508v s1146 per 100 000; 1·35 [0·84–2·19]). In terms of the
number of tumours, there was no effect on incidence of basal-cell carcinoma by sunscreen use or by betacarotene but theincidence of squamous-cell carcinoma was significantly lowerin the sunscreen group than in the no daily sunscreen group(1115 v s1832 per 100 000; 0·61 [0·46–0·81]).I n t e r p r e t a t i o nThere was no harmful effect of daily use ofsunscreen in this medium-term study. Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, but not basal-cell carcinoma seems to beamenable to prevention through the routine use of sunscreenby adults for 4·5 years. There was no beneficial or harmfuleffect on the rates of either type of skin cancer, as a result ofbetacarotene supplementation.L a n c e t1999; 3 5 4 :7 2 3 – 2 9See Commentary page 699I n t r o d u c t i o nThe incidence of skin cancer in white populations issimilar to the overall incidence of all other cancers, andcontinues to increase.1Although avoidance of long orintense sun exposure through shelter or protective clothing
is the mainstay of skin-cancer prevention,2amounts of sunexposure remain high in western populations.3Supplementary measures to lessen the harmful effects ofsun exposure have, therefore, been sought, and for manyyears the application of sunscreen to sun-exposed skin hasbeen advocated as one such measure. Although the short-term efficacy of sunscreen in the prevention of sunburn isundisputed, there is no evidence that long-term use ofsunscreen prevents skin cancer. Some evidence comesfrom two trials of sunscreen in relation to benign solarkeratoses. A trial of daily sunscreen application for 7months among 588 people with solar keratoses inAustralia suggested that the incidence of further keratoseswas decreased by the regular use of sunscreen,4as did thefollow-up of 50 volunteer patients of a US d e r m a t o l o g yclinic who were randomly assigned daily application ofsunscreen or sunscreen base.5Antioxidant micronutrients such as betacarotene may
also provide protection against skin cancer by lessening

The Nambour Skin Cancer Prevention Trial aimed toinvestigate the effectiveness of daily sunscreen applicationand of dietary betacarotene supplements in reducing theincidence of basal-cell carcinoma and of squamous-cellcarcinoma in 1621 members of a typical Queenslandcommunity over a period of 4·5 years.

724 THE LANCET • Vol 354 • August 28, 1999reduced their daily solar ultraviolet exposure by applicationof sunscreen to commonly sun-exposed sites on the head,neck, arms, and hands, or if the carcinogenic process wereopposed by betacarotene supplementation. Our hypothesiswas that each intervention would decrease the incidence ofnew basal-cell carcinomas or squamous-cell carcinomasand would lower the overall number of skin cancers ofeach type treated in the intervention period.M e t h o d sP a r t i c i p a n t sStudy participants were originally randomly chosen residents ofNambour, a township in southeast Queensland (latitude 26°S),who were aged between 20 and 69 years when they took part in askin-cancer survey in 1986.1 3To be eligible for the current study,the original survey participants had to attend a second survey in1992, undergo a complete skin examination by a dermatologistwith removal of all diagnosed skin cancers, and give written
consent to take part in this randomised trial until 1996. Thedesign and methods of the Nambour Trial have been reportedp r e v i o u s l y .1 4The ethics committee of the Queensland Institute ofMedical Research approved the study.D e s i g nIn a 2 by 2 factorial design, individuals were assigned, before the1992 survey, to one of four treatment groups by generation of arandom assignment sequence. At the 1992 baseline survey, thoseeligible were allocated to one of the four groups: daily use of sunprotection factor 15 plus broad-spectrum sunscreen and takingone 30 mg betacarotene tablet each day; daily sunscreen andplacebo tablets; betacarotene only; and placebo only. Participantsnot assigned to daily application of sunscreen were asked tocontinue application of sunscreen at their usual discretionary rate,which for most was recreational use. The treatment code wasknown only to the investigator who generated it and the two
people who packaged the tablets for distribution. None of thesepeople had contact with participants. The study sunscreen(Auscreen Ultrablock Lotion SPF 15-plus, Ross Cosmetics,Melbourne, Australia) was a standard cream containing 8% (by weight) 2-ethylhexyl- p-methoxycinnamate and 2% (byweight) 4- t e r t- b u t y l - 4/H11032-methoxy-4-dibenzoylmethane, rated aswater resistant with sun protection factor 16 according toAustralian Standard 2604.1 5The treatment protocol involved self-application of a layer to all exposed sites on the head, neck, arms,and hands every morning (reapplication was advised after heavysweating, bathing, or long sun exposure). All tablets wereidentical in external appearance and taste, although the placebotablets were internally paler than the betacarotene tablets.Participants were advised that the study tablets should be takenwith meals. Participants attended a study clinic every 3 months; those who
were randomised to daily sunscreen application received one ormore 250 mL bottles of sunscreen, and all participants receivedcalendar packs of assigned tablets as they returned previoussupplies. To estimate compliance with the sunscreen protocol,participants completed a questionnaire in the third and fifth yearsof the trial that asked about average frequency of sunscreen use ina normal week, and about outdoor behaviour. In addition, themeasured weights of all returned sunscreen bottles used by thosein the daily sunscreen group were recorded every 3 months. Arandom subgroup of trial participants completed 7-day diaries onthree separate occasions covering the summer and winter periods,in which they recorded frequency of sunscreen application andsun-exposure habits. Adherence to the tablet regimen wasmonitored by counts of remaining tablets every 3 months, and bymeasuring the concentration of betacarotene in the skin with aphotometric device every 2 years.1 6

photometric device every 2 years.1 6At follow-up clinics in 1994 and 1996, collaboratingdermatologists, unaware of treatment allocation, re-examinedactive participants. In 1996, 124 people who had withdrawnduring the trial responded to an invitation to attend the finalsurvey and were examined. All skin cancers clinically diagnosedduring these follow-up surveys were examined histologically by asingle dermatopathologist. At other times, participants carriedwallet-sized treatment cards that they presented to their localdoctors who recorded details, including the anatomical site, ofany clinically diagnosed skin cancer or solar keratosis theytreated. Participants were also asked every 3 months whether theyhad had any new skin cancers or other skin lesions treated sincelast contact (participants who had withdrawn were asked every 6months). When notification of a newly treated skin lesion wasreceived, that person’s medical records were examined (with his
or her written consent) and copies of histopathology reports wereobtained whenever available. A reported skin lesion was notcounted as a study endpoint unless it was confirmed by review ofTrial profile
THE LANCET • Vol 354 • August 28, 1999 725medical records. Skin cancers diagnosed within 1 year of the startof intervention were not included in analyses (an a-prioridecision) since they were thought to constitute latent diseasepresent at baseline.Statistical methodsThe primary endpoint for the intention-to-treat analysis wasincidence of skin cancer (person-time based) calculated as thenumber of people treated for new basal-cell carcinoma or newsquamous-cell carcinoma between Jan 1, 1993, and Aug 31,1996, divided by the person-years accumulated between thesedates and expressed per 100 000 person-years. Tumour rateswere calculated similarly, with the total number of tumoursoccurring for all participants as numerator. With 1600participants and a loss to follow-up of 5% per year, the study hada power of 80% to detect a 36% reduction in the incidence ofbasal-cell carcinoma overall, and a 43% reduction in incidence of
basal-cell carcinoma on sunscreen application sites at the 5%level of significance. With 80% power, the correspondingreductions for squamous-cell carcinoma were 59% overall and69% on sunscreen sites. Treatment effects on incidence (peopleaffected) were assessed with Poisson’s regression applied to thenumber of people treated for skin cancer. Treatment effects ontumour rates were assessed with extra-Poisson regression appliedto the total numer of tumours. Models used log (person-years) asoffset and were fitted by means of SAS 6.12 GENMOD programwhich also gives rate ratios and 95% CIs. Proportional-hazardsmodels were fitted to time to first skin cancer after Jan 1, 1993.Owing to the low event rate, hazard ratios obtained from thesemodels gave virtually identical results to those from Poisson’sregression and results have not been presented. Age adjustmentwas done within regressions, but since results changed only
slightly (because of the effective randomisation), unadjustedmodels have been presented.R e s u l t sOf 1647 eligible residents of Nambour who attended thebaseline skin-cancer survey in 1992, 1621 gave signedconsent to participate in the trial and were allocatedtreatments (figure). 436 (27%) of these people hadpreviously had skin cancer, and at baseline skin cancer wasdiagnosed for the first time in a further four people.Treatment allocation was unrelated to baselinecharacteristics of participants including age, sex, skin type,sun exposure, presence of skin damage caused by the sun,and history of skin cancer (table 1). In addition, theconcentrations of betacarotene in the skin, as estimated byskin reflectance measurements, were almost identical inthe randomised groups at baseline.After 12 months, 128 (8%) participants had withdrawnwith no subsequent follow-up. By 36 months there wereanother 88 withdrawals and at the end of the study in year
5, 238 (15%) participants had withdrawn without acomplete skin examination by a dermatologist in thefollow-up period. Those who withdrew without follow-upexamination were younger on average than the remainingparticipants (mean 47·0 [SD 14·1] v s49·1 [13·7] years,p=0·03) but were alike in all other respects. At the end ofthe trial, 75% of participants who were assigned dailysunscreen use were applying sunscreen to their head,neck, arms, and hands at least 3 or 4 days per week. Ofthose people not assigned to the sunscreen group, 74%were applying sunscreen to head, neck, and arms eithernot at all or no more than 1 or 2 days per week. Self-reported frequency of sunscreen application was wellcorrelated with estimated daily weight of sunscreen used(averaged across the entire intervention period) in thesunscreen group (rs=0·55, p<0·0001).On the basis of counts of returned tablets, 72% of thebetacarotene group and 70% of the placebo group took at
least 80% of the prescribed tablet intake over the entireintervention period. The betacarotene group hadsignificantly greater mean skin reflectance on the palm at
least 80% of the prescribed tablet intake over the entireintervention period. The betacarotene group hadsignificantly greater mean skin reflectance on the palm atfollow-up than at baseline (7·1 v s6·2, p<0·0001, paired ttest), and their follow-up values were greater than thoseof the placebo group (6·1, p<0·0001).789 new skin cancers were diagnosed in 256participants during follow-up until 1996. Histologicallyconfirmed skin cancer was diagnosed in 76 people at the1994 survey and in 80 at the final 1996 survey. Betweensurveys, general practitioners and dermatologistsdiagnosed 554 new skin cancers in 185 people; these caseswere confirmed on review of medical records. 67% of allinterim skin cancers were diagnosed histologically, and33% were clinically diagnosed. Analyses have been basedon the 1383 trial participants (85%) who had outcomedata based on at least one complete skin examination by adermatologist in 1994 or 1996, of whom 91% were active
participants when the trial ended in 1996. Skin cancersdiagnosed in 1992 were not included in the analysis. FromJanuary, 1993, there were 250 people with 758 new skincancers: 195 with at least one new basal-cell carcinoma,68 with a new squamous-cell carcinoma, 39 withintraepidermal carcinoma, and 12 with melanoma.Further analyses were restricted to basal-cell carcinomasand squamous-cell carcinomas, the two main types.Analyses of the effect of daily sunscreen use were basedon skin cancers occurring on the sites where sunscreenwas applied (the head, neck, arms, and hands; table 2). Interms of people treated, the incidence of basal-cellcarcinoma was similar in the sunscreen and no sunscreengroups, and the findings did not change materially whenanalyses were restricted to basal-cell carcinomas that hadbeen diagnosed histologically. For squamous-cellcarcinoma, the incidence (in terms of people treated) wasslightly but not significantly lower in the sunscreen group
than in the no sunscreen group (table 2).

726 THE LANCET • Vol 354 • August 28, 1999to the 40 people with histologically diagnosed squamous-cell carcinoma (rate ratio 0·74 [95% CI 0·39–1·38]).To assess further the effect purely of the sunscreenintervention on both types of skin cancer, analysis of theeffect of daily sunscreen use was repeated after exclusionof participants assigned betacarotene tablets. Theincidence of basal-cell carcinoma was similar in thesunscreen plus placebo subgroup and in the placebo-onlysubgroup (0·96 [0·59–1·57]) and that of squamous-cellcarcinoma about 25% lower in the subgroup allocatedsunscreen plus placebo (n=408) than in the placebo-onlygroup (n=393) (0·74 [0·31–1·77]); this difference was notsignificant. We also assessed the effect of daily sunscreenuse on total tumour incidence rate (based on total numberof skin cancers that occurred on sites where sunscreen wasapplied). The incidence of squamous-cell carcinoma atthese sites was significantly lower in the sunscreen group
than in the no sunscreen group (28 incident cancers in 22people v s46 incident cancers in 25 people; 0·61[0·46–0·81]). The distribution of squamous-cellcarcinomas in the control group was smooth and tailed offgradually. When analyses were restricted to the 36histologically diagnosed squamous-cell carcinomas, theincidence rate ratio (sunscreen group/no sunscreen group)was even lower (0·48 [0·35–0·64]). There was nodifference between the sunscreen and no sunscreen groupsin the rates of incident basal-cell carcinoma, in terms ofthe number of tumours (1·05 [0·82–1·34], table 2).Analysis of the effect of betacarotene supplementationwas based on skin cancer occurring on any part of thebody. In terms of people treated, the incidence of basal-cell carcinoma was similar in the betacarotene and placebogroups (table 3). For squamous-cell carcinomas theincidence was slightly but not significantly higher in thebetacarotene group than in the placebo group. When the
participants assigned sunscreen were excluded from theanalysis, the incidences of basal-cell carcinoma and ofsquamous-cell carcinoma were similar in the subgroupsallocated betacarotene alone and placebo alone (data notshown). In terms of incident tumours, the incidence forbasal-cell carcinoma was slightly but not significantlylower with betacarotene supplementation and that forsquamous-cell carcinoma was slightly but not significantlyhigher with betacarotene supplementation (table 3).Effects of sunscreen and of betacarotene treatments onthe incidence of basal-cell carcinoma or squamous-cellcarcinoma did not differ significantly between participantswith a history of skin cancer and those with no suchhistory, but estimates were unstable with wide confidencelimits in the various subgroups. There was a suggestion ofa greater treatment effect of daily sunscreen in terms ofpeople treated for squamous-cell carcinoma among those
with a history of skin cancer (0·78 [0·39–1·55]) thanamong those without a history (1·31 [0·45–3·77]), thoughthe difference was not significant (p=0·42). No consistentdifferences were seen in effects of daily sunscreen orbetacarotene between current smokers, ex-smokers, andnever-smokers (data not shown).The main reported complaints relating to daily use ofthe standard sunscreen were contact allergy or skinirritation (25 people), skin greasiness (ten), andinterference with perspiration or stinging eyes after facialperspiration (six). One participant withdrew from thestudy as a result of skin irritation, and symptoms werealleviated in a further 28 people when they switched to asubstitute sunscreen of similar SPF value provided by thesame manufacturer. By contrast, 65 people takingbetacarotene and 64 taking placebo tablets withdrew fromthe study because of symptoms attributed to the studytablets, or an unwillingness to take them (including three
who withdrew after adverse publicity of the results of
the study because of symptoms attributed to the studytablets, or an unwillingness to take them (including threewho withdrew after adverse publicity of the results ofanother randomised trial of betacarotene supplements1 0) .During the course of the trial there were 11 deaths among801 people assigned betacarotene supplementation, and21 deaths among the 820 assigned placebo, giving amortality ratio of 0·50 (95% CI 0·24–1·03). Main causesof death were cardiovascular disease (six betacarotenegroup; 12 placebo group) and cancer (three betacarotenegroup; seven placebo group). By the end of 1996, threemore deaths from cancer and one from another cause hadoccurred among people assigned betacarotenesupplements, and one more death from another cause hadoccurred among the placebo group.D i s c u s s i o nThe rates of new skin cancers in this study are higher thanthe rates of basal-cell carcinoma (788 per 100 000) andsquamous-cell carcinoma (321 per 100 000) reported for
Australians overall,1 7despite the use of potentiallypreventive agents. This finding reflects not only the higherbaseline level of skin cancers in residents of subtropicalQueensland, but also more intensive monitoring of newdiagnoses of skin cancer than has been possible inprevious surveys. Outcomes for basal-cell carcinomas andsquamous-cell carcinomas were analysed separatelydespite the small numbers of squamous-cell carcinomas,because they are distinct histological types of skin cancerthat show differing dependence on solar ultravioletradiation and on immune function. Squamous-cellcarcinomas are more directly dependent on high-dosecumulative ultraviolet exposure than are basal-cellc a r c i n o m a s1 8 , 1 9and squamous-cell carcinomaspredominate in transplant recipients.2 0Further evidence ofSkin cancer Participants TumoursBetacarotene Placebo Betacarotene PlaceboBasal-cell carcinomaNumber 102 93 268 285Incidence per 100 000 3954 3806 10 390 11 665

THE LANCET • Vol 354 • August 28, 1999 727biological differences between these two types of skincancer comes from a randomised prevention trial ofretinol on the incidence of skin cancer; the treatmentprevented squamous-cell carcinoma but not basal-cellc a r c i n o m a .2 1Although the numbers of people with basal-cell carcinomas that occurred during the 4·5-year trialwere sufficient to test the study hypotheses, the numbersof people affected with squamous-cell carcinomas wereinsufficient to allow conclusive statements on the effect ofthe interventions on person-based incidence.The daily application of a factor 15-plus sunscreen tothe head, neck, arms, and hands over a 4·5-year periodhad no effect on the risk of basal-cell carcinoma on thesesites. Similarly, betacarotene supplementation had noeffect on overall risk of basal-cell carcinoma. The lack ofresponse to the sunscreen intervention may be partlyexplained by the tendency for basal-cell carcinomas to
occur on sites other than the sites where sunscreen wasapplied in the trial. In the group receiving neither of theinterventions, 16 (32%) of the 50 first new basal-cellcarcinomas occurred on the trunk and lower limbscompared with one (7%) of 14 first new squamous-cellcarcinomas. This finding is consistent with other evidencethat the association between basal-cell carcinoma andsunlight is complex.1 8 , 1 9 , 2 2 , 2 3Sun exposure seems to inducebasal-cell carcinoma at low levels, consistent with thetheory that a lower threshold dose of solar radiation isrequired for malignant transformation of the highlymitotic target cells in the basal layer than is required totransform the epithelial keratinocytes in the moresuperficial layers of the epidermis from which squamous-cell carcinomas arise.1 9The occurrence of basal-cellcarcinomas at earlier ages than squamous-cell carcinomas,and on less sun-exposed sites like the trunk, also reflects
the lower dose of solar ultraviolet radiation required forbasal-cell than for squamous-cell carcinogenesis. A lack ofeffect of supplementary betacarotene on the incidence ofbasal-cell carcinoma is in line with the results of a previoustrial of betacarotene on the secondary prevention of skinc a n c e r .1 2However, treatment in the previous trial and theNambour trial was for no more than 5 years inparticipating adults, which might not have been for longenough or done early enough to show any effect on theoccurrence of basal-cell carcinoma, irrespective of ahistory of skin cancer. The results of the randomised trialof primary prevention of skin cancer after 12 years ofbetacarotene supplementation in the US Physicians’Health Study2 4should help clarify this issue.As expected, an effect of daily sunscreeen treatment wasseen for squamous-cell tumorigenesis, but the estimated12% reduction in the number of people affected bysquamous-cell carcinoma in the sunscreen treatment
group lacked precision owing to the small numbersinvolved. Exclusion of participants allocated betacarotenesupplementation seemed to increase the protective effectof daily sunscreen on squamous-cell carcinoma though theeffect did not achieve significance. In terms of totalnumbers of treated squamous-cell carcinomas, sunscreenhad a significant treatment effect. In analysis restricted tohistologically diagnosed squamous-cell carcinomas, therewas an even greater reduction in tumour-based incidence.Lower rates of squamous-cell carcinoma support ourhypothesis that skin cancer can be prevented by routineapplication of sunscreen by adults who thereby reduce thelate-stage carcinogenic effect of accumulated everyday sunexposure. Reduction of early-stage carcinogenesis by thismeans may involve intervention before adulthood andwould require very long follow-up to observe a significanteffect on rates of cancer.2 5On the basis of the observed difference in the dose-
response curves for sun exposure between squamous-cell
would require very long follow-up to observe a significanteffect on rates of cancer.2 5On the basis of the observed difference in the dose-response curves for sun exposure between squamous-cellcarcinoma and basal-cell carcinoma,1 9we suggest that thepromotion period needed to induce squamous-cellcarcinoma is longer. This longer period would increase thelikelihood that interventions influencing the promotionstage will be more effective for squamous-cell carcinomathan for basal-cell carcinoma because the longer thepromotion period of a cancer, the greater the chance ofsuch an intervention being effective.2 5Although chancecannot be ruled out as an explanation of the preventiveeffect of regular sunscreen use on squamous-cellcarcinoma, this effect was consistently seen in the analysesand its existence is supported by evidence from animals t u d i e s2 6and trials with solar keratoses as surrogatee n d p o i n t s .4 , 5Since squamous-cell carcinomas are more
closely linked with immune suppression than are basal-cellcarcinomas, sunscreens may also provide an avenue ofprotection against squamous-cell carcinoma by shieldingthe skin’s immune system. There is evidence that high-factor sunscreens prevent ultraviolet-radiation-inducedimmune suppression of contact hypersensitivity in mice,2 7and we have shown that daily sunscreen application canprotect against depletion of Langerhans cells.2 8There was a small non-significant increase in incidence of squamous-cell carcinoma with betacarotenesupplementation. Because we have no evidence thatbetacarotene supplementation enhances development ofsquamous-cell carcinoma from experimental studies orfrom our auxiliary analysis of a betacarotene effect afterexclusion of sunscreen users, we believe this a chancef i n d i n g .Observation bias is unlikely to have substantiallyinfluenced our findings, because all reported skin cancerswere validated against medical records before their
inclusion. Furthermore, results were similar whetherbased on basal-cell carcinomas that were clinically orhistologically confirmed, or histologically confirmed only.However, results for squamous-cell carcinomas showedsystematically greater differences between treatmentgroups, and p values were smaller when analyses werelimited to only those skin cancers diagnosed histologically,suggesting some misclassification of squamous-cellcarcinomas with only clinical diagnoses. People for whomfollow-up skin examination data were available weredistributed evenly across the treatment groups, and 91%were active participants throughout the follow-up period.Factors that are strongly predictive of skin cancer (such asage, sex, skin type, and history of skin cancer) were alsobalanced across treatment groups.Frequency of sunscreen application to the skin wasgreater in those allocated daily application of sunscreenthan in those not allocated daily use. Hence, lack of
compliance with the sunscreen regimen is unlikely to havematerially influenced the results. The results might havebeen different if a higher-factor sunscreen had beenissued, but we do not believe so. Application of the factor15-plus (specifically SPF 16) sunscreen used in this studytheoretically reduced the amount of ultraviolet-B radiation(wavelength 290–320 nm) to the skin by 94%, comparedwith a 97% reduction that would have resulted fromapplication of a factor 32 sunscreen. However, the less-than-ideal comparison group did reduce the likelihood
728 THE LANCET • Vol 354 • August 28, 1999that the study would detect a distinct effect of dailysunscreen application. The ideal, namely a comparisongroup randomly allocated a placebo sunscreen, would beindefensible in subtropical Queensland, because peoplewho normally apply protective sunscreen would be liableto severe sunburn (and of course masking would becompromised by the development of sunburn). Our onlyalternative was to compare the sunscreen interventionwith discretionary use of sunscreen. As a check on howrobust and practical this design was, we estimated theattenuation in treatment effect that occurred when theempirical compliance rates in the sunscreen intervention(75%) and control (74%) groups were taken into account.We back-calculated the effectiveness that would have beenobserved in this study over a range of values of trueefficacy and showed that our ability to detect an observedeffectiveness of 30%, which was the minimum significant
treatment effect at the 5% level given the study size andobserved incidence of basal-cell carcinoma, correspondedto an ability to detect a true efficacy of daily sunscreen useof 50%. However, these calculations also showed thatwhen the observed effectiveness was close to zero (as seenhere), the absolute effect of empirical lack of compliancebecame small to negligible. For example, the 3%effectiveness for basal-cell carcinoma observed,corresponded to a 6% true efficacy of the sunscreentreatment. We conclude that the measured lack ofcompliance explained neither the lack of observedeffectiveness for basal-cell carcinoma nor the nullstatistical result, unless the true efficacy was very smalland so the trial was sufficiently robust to detect a materialeffect of daily sunscreen use on the incidence of basal-cellcarcinoma. Moreover, no changes in outdoor behaviour ofparticipants were observed in the follow-up period thatcould have influenced outcomes within randomised
could have influenced outcomes within randomisedgroups; in particular, there was no measurable increase insun exposure among those allocated to daily sunscreenuse. With regard to betacarotene supplementation, thephotometric measurements of skin colour confirmed thatthe supplemented group maintained significantly higheramounts of betacarotene in the skin during the study thanthose receiving placebo.Apart from the primary prevention trial in thePhysicians’ Health Study,2 4the only other publishedrandomised trials of betacarotene or sunscreen that arerelevant to skin-cancer prevention have been secondaryprevention trials.4 , 5 , 1 2About 73% of participants in ourstudy had no history of skin cancer at baseline, and theinterventions were aimed mainly at primary prevention ofskin cancer. Inevitably, however, the proportion with ahistory of disease at baseline comprised a subgroup atespecially high risk of new skin cancers, and the findings
suggested that the preventive effect on squamous-cellcarcinoma was greater in this subgroup.We conclude that there is no beneficial or harmful effectof betacarotene supplementation with respect to theoccurrence of basal-cell or squamous-cell carcinoma.Also, there is no harmful effect of daily sunscreen use inthe medium term. Our findings suggest that dailyapplication of sunscreen to the head, neck, arms, andhands may reduce the incidence of squamous-cellcarcinomas on these sites, especially in people with ahistory of skin cancer. Morever, we have shown thatprevention of squamous-cell carcinoma can be achieved atthe population level, through recommendation of a changein sun-protective behaviour of the community (routinesunscreen application) that can be successfully maintainedover a period of 4·5 years. There is no evidence that basal-cell carcinoma is amenable to prevention when this sun-protection measure is recommended in adulthood, and for
less than 5 years. Further evidence on possible longer-term effects of treatment on squamous-cell carcinomas

THE LANCET • Vol 354 • August 28, 1999 729S u m m a r yB a c k g r o u n dResistance of HIV-1 to antiretroviral drugs is themain cause of antiretroviral-treatment failure. We assessedthe transmission of drug-resistant variants among individualswith primary HIV-1 infection.M e t h o d sPopulation-based sequencing of the viral reverse-transcriptase and protease genes derived from plasma viralRNA was done in 82 consecutive individuals with documentedprimary HIV-1 infection f rom January, 1996, to July, 1998.Phenotypic resistance to protease inhibitors was assessed byrecombinant virus assay in individuals with two or moremutations associated with resistance to protease inhibitors.F i n d i n g sZidovudine-resistance mutations were detected inseven (9%) of 82 individuals. Mutations associated withresistance to other reverse-transcript ase inhibitors (RTIs) weredetected in two individuals. Primary-resistance mutationsassociated with protease inhibitors (V82A, L90M) were
detected in three (4%) of 70 individuals; two of these had alsoRTI-resistance mutations. Decreased sensitivity to three orfour protease inhibitors was seen in three individuals, one ofwhom was infected with HIV-1 variants that harboured 12mutations associated with resistance to multiple RTI andprotease inhibitors.I n t e r p r e t a t i o nTo introduce the best antiretroviral treatment,resistance testing should be done in recently HIV-1-infectedi n d i v i d u a l s .L a n c e t1999; 3 5 4 :7 2 9 – 3 3See Commentary page 697I n t r o d u c t i o nResistance of HIV-1 to antiretroviral drugs is a widespreadproblem that limits the efficacy of antiretroviral treatment.The main causes for the emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants include suboptimum treatment orincomplete adherence to therapy.1Other causes are relatedto the pre-existence of drug-resistant variants within HIV-1q u a s i s p e c i e s2 , 3and the transmission of HIV-1-resistant
variants at the time of the infection.4 – 7In more-developed countries, most HIV-1-infectedpatients are treated with combined antiretroviral therapythat includes reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) andprotease inhibitors. Patients with successive virologicalfailure to initial and rescue therapy harbour HIV-1 variantsthat have mutations associated with resistance to severalantiretroviral drugs, which limits the success of subsequentt h e r a p y .8 , 9This fact has led to the concept that an initialtreatment able to fully suppress viral replication providesthe best chance for the patient in the long term. Tripletherapy has been associated with a better virological andclinical outcome than double therapy.1 0 , 1 1Consequently, thetransmission of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants will decreasethe efficacy of initial therapy by impairing the activity of oneor more drugs included in the treatment regimen.Over the past 5 years, in countries with wide access to
antiretroviral drugs, the transmission of HIV-1 variantsresistant to zidovudine has been detected in 5–15% ofi n d i v i d u a l s ,4 , 5and transmission of variants resistant tolamivudine and nevirapine has been also reported.6 , 1 2T h etransmission of HIV-1 variants resistant to RTI andprotease inhibitors has been reported in one patient withprimary HIV-1 infection.7However, there have been nosystematic studies of the transmission of HIV-1 variantsresistant to protease inhibitors.We assessed the prevalence of drug-resistant HIV-1variants in individuals with documented primary HIV-1i n f e c t i o n .M e t h o d sStudy participantsAll consecutive individuals with primary HIV-1 infection referredto the Geneva AIDS Centre between January, 1996, and July,Transmission of antiretrov i r a l - d rug-resistant HIV-1 variantsS Yerly, L Kaiser, E Race, J-P Bru, F Clavel, L PerrinLaboratory of Virology, Division of Infectious Diseases, Geneva
