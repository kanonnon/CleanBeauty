M. Evans, July 18, 2001Despite its long history, the central effects of progressive depletion
of vitamin A in adult mice has not been previously described. Anexamination of vitamin-deprived animals revealed a progressiveand ultimately profound impairment of hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation and a virtual abolishment of long-term depres-sion. Importantly, these losses are fully reversible by dietaryvitamin A replenishment in vivo or direct application of all trans -
retinoic acid to acute hippocampal slices. We ﬁnd retinoid respon-sive transgenes to be highly active in the hippocampus, and byusing dissected explants, we show the hippocampus to be a site ofrobust synthesis of bioactive retinoids. In aggregate, these resultsdemonstrate that vitamin A and its active derivatives function asessential competence factors for long-term synaptic plasticitywithin the adult brain, and suggest that key genes required forlong-term potentiation and long-term depression are retinoiddependent. These data suggest a major mental consequence forthe hundreds of millions of adults and children who are vitamin Adeﬁcient.Vitamin A and its derivatives (the retinoids) activate signalingpathways necessary for development, differentiation, and
homeostasis of several tissues, including the nervous system (1,2). Known impairments caused by the lack of dietary vitamin Ainclude blindness, infertility, embryonic malformations, andcompromised immunity. Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is cur-rently a risk for over 100 million children in over 75 countries,and results in nearly 3.2 million associated childhood deathsannually (refs. 3 and 4, and http: yywww.unicef.org ysowc98).The biological effects of retinoids are mediated by retinoidreceptors, a subgroup of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Theretinoid receptor family includes the retinoic acid receptors(RARs;a,b, and g), which bind all trans -retinoic acid and 9- cisretinoic acid, and the retinoid X receptors (RXRs; a,b, and g),which bind 9- cisretinoic acid only. RAR yRXR heterodimers,
and to some extent RXR homodimers, act as transcriptionfactors by binding to retinoid response elements in the promotersof target genes and activating gene expression in the presence ofligand (1, 4, 5). Multiple combinations of RAR yRXR het-erodimers are possible, depending on the overlapping expressionof receptor subtypes within tissues (1).Each RAR and RXR exhibits a specific expression pattern inthe adult central nervous system (CNS), distinct from that foundin the developing nervous system (2, 6–10), indicating that, inaddition to the modulation of neuronal development duringembryogenesis, retinoids are likely to regulate activities in themature brain. Supporting this notion, evidence suggests thatRARb, RXR b, and RXR gmodulate locomotor behavior by
b, RXR b, and RXR gmodulate locomotor behavior byregulating the expression of dopamine receptors in the adultstriatum (11). Additionally, retinoic acid production is requiredin distinct regions of the adult songbird brain for song matura-tion, a learned behavior (12). Moreover, we recently found thatRARb22and RXR g22knockout mice display impaired hip-pocampal synaptic plasticity as well as compromised learningduring behavioral tests (13). Despite this array of data, a role forretinoids in the adult nervous system has never been directly
pocampal synaptic plasticity as well as compromised learningduring behavioral tests (13). Despite this array of data, a role forretinoids in the adult nervous system has never been directlydemonstrated.Two forms of synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation(LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), are generally viewed ascellular mechanisms for learning and memory, and result inactivity-dependent long-lasting modification of synaptic efficacy(14–17). Hippocampal CA1 LTP and LTD require depolariza-tion of the postsynaptic membrane to relieve a magnesiumblockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and allowthe entry of Ca21(14, 18, 19). The consequent influx initiatesCa21-dependent signaling that involves the activation of several
kinases during LTP and several phosphatases during LTD(20–22). The signaling cascade beyond calcium influx involvingan activation of calcium-dependent processes remains unknown,although many proteins have been implicated through eitherpharmacological or genetic studies.Recognizing that retinoid receptor knockout experimentssuggest retinoid influence on LTP and LTD, this work does notestablish a direct correlation between retinoid function andmature hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Mice lacking the RARbgene are severely deficient in both, whereas RXR gnull micespecifically lack LTD but retain normal LTP (13). These im-pairments could reflect a critical role for the retinoid receptorsduring neuronal patterning and development during embryo-genesis. However, they may be due to a lack of retinoid-inducedtranscription in the adult that might be necessary for theexpression of proteins critical for the induction of LTP and LTD.To determine whether retinoids modulate synaptic plasticity
in the adult hippocampus, we used experimentally inducedpostnatal VAD in mice. Postnatal VAD is initiated via gradualdepletion of prenatal vitamin A stores in the liver (23–25). Thisapproach enables normal embryogenesis and postnatal devel-opment while permitting controlled vitamin A depletion in theadult mouse. In this study, we demonstrate that progressivelyVAD mice develop a complete loss of CA1 hippocampal LTD,along with a severe impairment of LTP, whereas postsynapticresponses remain normal. Dietary vitamin A replenishment, aswell as direct application of retinoic acid to hippocampal slicescollected from VAD mice, fully rescues these phenotypes,indicating that retinoids function dynamically to modulate LTPand LTD. Additionally, by using explants, we demonstratelocalized production of bio-active retinoids within the hippocam-pus. These results establish a role for vitamin A and its naturaland pharmacological congeners in phenomena related to higher

These data also raisethe larger social question as to the mental health of the hundredsof millions of adults and children that are clinically VAD.MethodsRetinoid Detection. Mice transgenic for the GAL4-RAR con-struct, previously described (26), contain the ligand-bindingdomain (LBD) of human RARafused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD). Brains of these mice were sectioned into1-mm-thick slices and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylb-D-galactoside (X-Gal).JEG-3 cells were cotransfected with the GAL4-RAR expres-sion vector and a GAL4-responsive luciferase reporter. Adulthippocampal explants were cocultured with these transfectedcells as previously described (27).Mice Preparation. Vitamin A-deficient and -sufficient mice wereproduced as described previously (25). Briefly, pregnant inbredSENCAR dams at 2 weeks post coitum were obtained from the
National Cancer Institute facility at Frederick, MD (FrederickResearch Development Center and Animal Production). Theywere placed on rodent diet (TD 8604, Harlan Teklad, Madison,WI). At parturition, mice were separated into two groups. Onegroup (dam and offspring) were fed a VAD rodent diet (TD69523, Harlan Teklad) containing no sources or precursors ofvitamin A. The other group was fed a vitamin A-sufficient rodentdiet containing 3mg retinoic acid per gram of diet (TD 87373,Harlan Teklad). At 3 weeks of age, pups were weaned onto eitherdiet for the specified time. Daily side observations wereperformed.Immunohistochemistry. At time points of 12, 13, 15, 17, and 19weeks of age, mice were killed, and the reproductive tractincluding vagina, cervix, uterine horns, and ovaries were excisedand fixed in 70% ethanol at 4°C. Tissues were sent to AmericanHistoLab (Gaithersburg, MD) for paraffin embedding and hor-izontal sectioning (5mm). Sections were stained immunohisto-
mm). Sections were stained immunohisto-chemically as previously described (25).Slice Preparation. Experiments were performed blindly on micebetween 5 and 19 weeks of age. Control animals were age-matched littermates of VAD mice. Mice were anesthetized byisofluorane and decapitated. The brain was removed and placedin ice cold solution (120 mM NaCl y3.5 mM KCl y0.7 mMCaCl2y4 mM MgCl 2y1.25 mM NaH 2PO 4y26 mM NaHCO 3y10mM glucose) bubbled with 95% O 2y5% CO 2. The same cold highMg21, low Ca21solution was used throughout the dissectionprocedure to prevent transmitter release and minimize injury tothe cells. The hindbrain was cut away, and the flat surface of theforebrain was glued to the pan of a DSK 1500E Microslicervibratome (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) with cyanoacrylate glue.The hippocampus of each slice (350mm) was dissected out andplaced in a chamber containing the same dissecting bufferperfused with 95% O2y5% CO 2. Slices were allowed to incubate
2y5% CO 2. Slices were allowed to incubateat room temperature in the holding chamber for at least 1 hbefore recording.Electrophysiology. All experiments were performed at roomtemperature. Individual slices were placed in a submergedrecording chamber, held by a net made with flattened platinumwire and nylon threads. Slices were perfused with solution (120mM NaCl y3.5 mM KCl y2.6 mM CaCl2y1.3 mM MgCl 2y1.25 mMNaH 2PO 4y26 mM NaHCO 3y10 mM glucose) saturated with95% O 2y5% CO 2, at a rate of 2 ml ymin. A cut was made betweenthe CA1 and CA3 region to prevent recurrent excitation. Schaef-fer collateral-commissural fibers were stimulated by ultrasmallconcentric bipolar electrodes (FHC, Bowdoinham, ME) deliv-ering 0.1-ms pulses. CA1 field potentials were recorded withglass electrodes (3–4 M Vresistance) filled with perfusing buffer.
Stimulus intensity was adjusted to evoke similarly sized baselineresponses. LTP was induced by a tetanus consisting of five trainsof 100 Hz stimulation lasting 200 ms at an intertrain interval of10 s. LTD was evoked by 900 stimuli at a frequency of 1 Hz.Recordings were performed by using an Axopatch 200 amplifier,filtered at 2 kHz, and analyzed with programs written inVISUALBASIC . The initial slopes of field excitatory postsynaptic poten-tials (fEPSPs) were measured for field potentials. Data areexpressed as mean 6SEM.VAD slices at 17–18 weeks of age were incubated with 0.1mMalltrans -retinoic acid in DMSO (Sigma), for eithe r2ho rovernight before the induction of LTP and LTD. VAD micewere replenished with dietary vitamin A at 17–18 weeks, andused 48 h after vitamin A replenishing.Histology. VAD and control mice were killed by carbon dioxide
asphyxiation, and brains were immediately collected and placedin 10% buffered formalin phosphate at room temperature. Theywere then embedded in paraffin, sectioned into 8-mm slices, andstained with Nissl stain and cresyl violet. Photographs weretaken at 340 magnification.ResultsRetinoid Activity Is Present in the Adult Hippocampus. To demon-strate that retinoic acid is present and active in the adulthippocampus, we used an in vivo retinoid detection assay by usingtransgenic mice expressing the LBD of human RARafused tothe DBD of GAL4 (26). These mice were crossed to reportermice carrying the lacZ gene controlled by an upstream activatingsequence (UAS) (26). The result is a transgenic mouse express-ingb-galactosidase only when the hRAR a-LBD is activated byligand. Therefore, we could use these progeny mice to detectFig. 1. Retinoid detection in the adult hippocampus. ( AandB) Two examples
show X-Gal staining in the adult hippocampus of GAL4-RAR transgenic mice,giving rise to scattered, strongly positive cells in CA1, -2, and -3 of thehippocampus. More intense staining is seen in the dentate gyrus. Scatteredpositive cells are also present in the cortex and in undeﬁned nuclei of thethalamus. ( C) Adult hippocampal explants have been cocultured with JEG-3cells transfected with GAL4-RAR expression vector and a GAL4 responsiveluciferase reporter. The data demonstrate that hippocampus contains (lowlevels of) RAR-inducing activity, presumably retinoic acid.Misner et al. PNAS uSeptember 25, 2001 uvol. 98 uno. 20 u11715NEUROBIOLOGY
retinoid activity in the hippocampus of adult mouse brain. X-Galstaining revealed a distinct spatial pattern of retinoid activity inthe adult brain (Fig. 1 Aand B). The dark and specific stainingwithin the CA1, -2, and -3 regions of the hippocampus, as wellas the dentate gyrus, demonstrate endogenous retinoids in theadult hippocampus that are sufficiently able to induce signalingthrough their cognate retinoid receptors.We also performed a cell-based reporter assay to detectretinoid signaling in the adult hippocampus. In this experiment,adult hippocampus is dissected, and explants are cocultured withcells cotransfected with both GAL4-RAR and UAS-luciferaseconstructs. The hippocampal explants produced an approximate5-fold increase in RAR signaling as compared with a non-hippocampal neuronal control (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, the hip-
pocampus is an active site of retinoid biosynthesis. In combina-tion, these results plainly demonstrate endogenous retinoidactivity in the adult hippocampus.Vitamin A Deficiency Is Observable by Age 12 Weeks. The onset ofpostnatal vitamin A deficiency is due to a gradual depletion ofretinyl esters from the liver, the primary storage compartmentthat releases these hormones via the blood to target organs, suchas the hippocampus, on demand. As these stores deplete,retinoid levels in the peripheral tissues are exhausted. VitaminA deficiency is typically monitored by the formation of keratinK5-positive squamous metaplastic lesions in the endocervicaland uterine epithelium because of a loss of epithelial differen-tiation. In our protocol, we found squamous metaplastic K5-postive cells to appear around 12 weeks and older (data notshown), indicating the onset of depletion of endogenous vitaminA at this time point.Mice developed observable symptoms of VAD such as cloudy
eyes, loss of near total body fat, matted fur, a hunchback posture,and premature death, at variable rates. In general, these symp-toms began at ’11–12 weeks of age and continued to progressthroughout the time course of the experiment, resulting in deathby 19 weeks of age.Vitamin A Deficiency Impairs Hippocampal LTP and LTD. Previousstudies have shown that lack of RAR band RXR gimpairs
long-term synaptic plasticity despite what otherwise appeared tobe healthy and fertile mice (13). Because the retinoids are knownto modulate neuronal development, the possibility that devel-opmental defects in the knockout mice underlie the defect insynaptic plasticity could not be excluded. To specifically deter-mine the ongoing requirement for vitamin A in CA1 LTP andLTD, electrophysiological experiments were performed on hip-pocampal slices from VAD mice. Because these animals aregenetically and developmentally normal, this approach elimi-nates the potential for confounding developmental defects. TheLTP and LTD field potentials were measured at various timepoints during the vitamin A depletion phase. Age-matchedcontrols on a vitamin A-sufficient diet were monitored inparallel.A summary of normalized fEPSPs from age-matched control
and VAD mice is shown (Fig. 2). In general, as VAD developsand symptoms of the disease begin to appear, LTP and LTDbecome progressively impaired, beginning at the age of 12 weeksand reaching maximal impairment at the age of 15 weeks (Figs.3 and 4). The magnitude of LTP and LTD from VAD slices atboth 12–13 weeks and 15 weeks was significantly different fromLTP and LTD of control slices ( P,0.05; Kolmogorov-Smirnovtwo-sample statistic).Mice developed outward symptoms of disease at varying timepoints throughout the course of deficiency. Nonetheless, whenLTP and LTD were compared between VAD mice displaying noapparent external symptoms vs. those with classic VAD symp-toms at the ages of 12 and 15 weeks, LTP and LTD were similarlydepressed (data not shown). Because the nonsymptomatic miceexhibited the same impairments in LTP and LTD, the centraleffects appear to be a highly reliable measure of VAD and are
exhibited the same impairments in LTP and LTD, the centraleffects appear to be a highly reliable measure of VAD and aresubject to less variability than the external phenotypes.LTP and LTD Loss Is Reversible. Vitamin A replenishment was usedto determine whether the impairment in LTP and LTD waspermanent. Mice on a VAD diet were returned to a vitaminA-sufficient diet after maximal LTP and LTD loss was reached(at 17 weeks), and synaptic plasticity was measured 48 h later(Fig. 2 AandB). Remarkably, both LTP and LTD rebounded tonormal values, indicating that the forfeited response can be fullyreversed in vivo .Because dietary vitamin A supplementation rescued LTP andLTD, we sought to determine whether direct application of theRAR ligand all trans -retinoic acid was sufficient to rescue thedeficiency. Initially, hippocampal slices from VAD mice at age17 weeks were incubated with physiological concentrations of alltrans -retinoic acid for 2–6 h, a time at which target genes should
be activated but with protein levels only beginning to change. Asexpected, no significant improvement of LTP and LTD wasobserved with slices treated in this short period (Figs. 5 and 6).However, when the incubation period was increased to allowmRNA and protein accumulation (at least 12 h), LTP and LTDwere completely restored (Figs. 5 and 6). Together, these studieslocalize the defect within the hippocampus and demonstrate thata rate of rescue occurs in a time frame consistent with RARFig. 2. Hippocampal CA1 LTP and LTD is impaired in VAD mice, but can berescued by dietary vitamin A replenishment.

transcriptional activation. Accordingly, ligand replacement, ei-ther by dietary replenishment, or direct application, reverses theeffects of vitamin A deficiency on LTP and LTD, supporting itsrole as a unique competence factor in synaptic plasticity.Synaptic Response Is Not Affected by VAD. We analyzed postsyn-aptic responses from slices of control and VAD mice to deter-mine that the synaptic deficit in VAD mice is not secondary toa defect in basal synaptic transmission. Basal synaptic strengthwas calculated by averaging the mean peak amplitudes of fEPSPselicited by half-maximal stimulation for control, VAD, andFig. 3.

VAD-replenished mice at 17–19 weeks of age. The mean peakamplitude was 20.716 60.079 mV for control slices ( n512),20.734 60.044 mV for VAD slices ( n533), and 20.695 60.069mV for VAD dietary-replenished slices ( n510), and was notsignificantly different between groups (two-sample ttest; P.0.05). The kinetics of the responses were also similar between allgroups, with a mean rise time of 2.48 60.16 ms for control slices(n512), 2.38 60.10 ms for VAD slices ( n533), and 2.29 60.11 ms for VAD dietary-replenished slices ( n510). The risetimes were measured at 10–90% of the peak response, and werenot significantly different between groups (two-sample ttest;P.0.05). Therefore, the postsynaptic responses in VAD miceare essentially unchanged from the controls.During induction of LTP and LTD, VAD responses were also
similar to control responses. Although long-term synaptic plas-ticity was impaired in VAD mice, short-term synaptic plasticitywas unaffected by the lack of dietary vitamin A, suggesting thatsynapses could be potentiated or depressed immediately afterinduction protocols, but were not able to maintain long-lastingchanges in synaptic strength.Hippocampus Appears Normal in VAD Mice. Because vitamin A
deficiency has been shown to cause degeneration of peripheralnervous tissue, we investigated its effects on hippocampal struc-ture in these mice (28). No distinguishable difference betweenthe acute hippocampal slices from control and VAD animals wasobserved. The ventricles of VAD mice appeared enlarged by theage of 15 weeks, but hippocampal structure remained intact andthe synaptic responses recorded from these slices were notnoticeably different, indicating that hippocampal neurons werenot measurably degenerated. Serial lateral sections of the brainsof VAD and control mice were stained by using Nissl stain andcresyl violet and compared for altered histology. This series ofsections showed indistinguishable hippocampal morphology be-tween VAD and control mice (Fig. 7 and unpublished results).These results are consistent with the previous demonstrationthat RARband RXR gknockout mice, while lacking LTP orLTD, have structurally normal synapses in the CA1 region of thehippocampus (13).
DiscussionWe present data establishing the presence of retinoids in theadult hippocampus and a regional role for retinoid signaling inlong-term hippocampal synaptic plasticity. We demonstratethat endogenous retinoid activity in the adult mouse hip-pocampus is both present and sufficient to activate retinoidsignaling pathways, and that the hippocampus is a syntheticsource of bio-active retinoids. Furthermore, impairment ofLTP and LTD directly correlates to the degree of retinoiddeprivation, whereas dietary retinoid replacement or directapplication of retinoic acid to hippocampal slices rescues the
impairment of both LTP and LTD completely. Induction of aVAD state after animal maturation as well as the full resto-ration of hippocampal synaptic plasticity on retinoid replen-ishment indicate that vitamin A signaling is specifically nec-essary in the mature hippocampus. Previously, wedemonstrated the requirement for two retinoid receptor sub-types in hippocampal CA1 synaptic plasticity. In combination,these results suggest that retinoid-directed gene expression canmodulate LTP and LTD in the adult hippocampus.Whereas several lines of evidence have indicated retinoic acid
Whereas several lines of evidence have indicated retinoic acidsynthesis in the adult brain (13, 29), none have specificallyestablished regional retinoid presence in the adult hippocampus.Transcription induced by Gal4-DBD fused to a retinoid receptorLBD in transgenic mice directly demonstrates that retinoids arenaturally present and signal through their cognate receptors inthe adult hippocampus. Transcription by this fused retinoid-sensitive transcription factor in cells cultured with hippocampalexplants indicates that retinoids are in fact synthesized in theadult hippocampus, consistent with the local expression ofretinoid metabolic and transfer proteins such as CRBPI,CRABPI, and RALDH2 (12, 30–32). These discoveries dem-onstrate that retinoic acid both is produced and is physiologicallyactive in the adult CNS.Through analysis of postsynaptic responses in VAD and
control mice, we show that the impairments to LTP and LTD areunlikely to be due to defects in basal synaptic transmission.Furthermore, the RARb22and RXR g22knockout mice retainstructurally and functionally normal synapses, as examined byelectromicroscopy, as well as electrophysiological analysis (13).Hence, at least in the adults, retinoids do not appear to modulatebasal transmission at a synapse, but instead influence the abilityto change synaptic effectiveness.The rescue of LTP and LTD through direct application ofretinoic acid to hippocampal slices shows that the negativeeffects of vitamin A depletion on the hippocampus are notpermanent. The reversibility of these effects is in accord with thereversibility of most postnatal symptoms of VAD, and is con-sistent with a role of retinoid receptors as transcriptional regu-lators of genes that induce LTP yLTD. Furthermore, the revers-
ibility of these effects makes it unlikely that they are due toanatomical changes. Finally, the rescue of LTP and LTD byagonist application in acute hippocampal slices suggests thatretinoids act within the CA1 yCA3 region as opposed to a distalsite outside of the hippocampus. One consequence of actingwithin the hippocampus is that it uncouples the central effects ofvitamin A from those in the periphery, such as epithelialkeratinization. Therefore, despite variable rates of appearanceof external phenotypes, VAD mice display highly predictablerates of LTP and LTD reduction.Whereas LTD is virtually abolished in VAD mice, LTPreduces by ’50% and then remains steady until the time ofdeath. In contrast, RARb22and RAR b22yRXR g22knockoutmice exhibited a nearly complete impairment of LTP at all agestested. One possible explanation may be that, in the presence ofwild-type receptors, endogenous compounds are able to partiallysubstitute for retinoids to promote partial RAR yRXR function.
For example, it has recently been shown that docosahexaenoicacid (DHA) is a low affinity ligand for retinoid receptors, ishighly enriched in the adult brain, and is a low affinity ligand forretinoid receptors (33). Interestingly, DHA has been implicatedas playing a role in long-term memory and spatial learning (34).Whereas the mechanisms of induction of LTP and LTD areunknown, present models suggest that the concentration and yorlocation of calcium after neuronal stimulation dictate whetherpotentiation or depression will follow (35, 36). If indeed calciumis a determining factor in distinguishing LTP and LTD pathways,proteins involved in calcium buffering or signaling may beFig. 7. Overall hippocampal structure is maintained in VAD mice. Coronalslices of hippocampus in control ( A) and VAD ( B) mice show indistinguishablemorphology, indicating that vitamin A deﬁciency does not result in obviousneurodegeneracy of hippocampus.

candidate targets. In fact, VAD has been observed to causeaccumulation of calcium in the brains of rats (37) and in culturedCNS cells (38). Furthermore, neurogranin (RC3), a Ca21-sensitive calmodulin-binding protein, is a retinoid target gene(39). Interestingly, neurogranin knockout mice are impaired inspatial learning as well as hippocampal synaptic plasticity (40).Retinoic acid has also been shown to induce expression ofcalbindin D28K (CaBD28K), a calcium-buffering protein foundin hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (41, 42). CaBD28K-deficient mice suffer loss of LTP (43). Retinoic acid inducesprotein kinase C (PKC) activity (44), membrane Ca21ATPaseactivity (45), and the phosphatase calcineurin (38). Together,these examples indicate potential mechanisms by which retinoidsignaling could modulate synaptic plasticity.The data presented here provide direct evidence that bioactive
retinoids are generated within the hippocampus and are requiredfor higher CNS function. In this model, vitamin A acts as acompetence factor, presumably promoting the activation oftarget genes encoding key proteins for both LTP and LTD.Interestingly, the different behavior in these two phenomenasuggests that different retinoic acid-induced proteins may mod-ulate LTP and LTD. These data suggest a major health conse-quence for vitamin A deficiency. Understanding how vitamin Aaffects cognition and other higher functions is therefore clini-cally and pharmacologically important, particularly because theimpairments of LTP and LTD appear to be reversible.We thank members of the Evans lab for critical reading of the manuscript
