ReviewOccurrences, toxicities, and ecological risks of benzophenone-3, acommon component of organic sunscreen products: A mini-reviewSujin Kim, Kyungho Choi ⁎School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Republic of Koreaabstract article infoArticle history:Received 13 December 2013Accepted 21 May 2014Available online 14 June 2014Keywords:UVﬁlterBenzophenone-1Endocrine disruptionSurface waterBenzophenone-3 (BP-3) has been widely used in sunscreens and many other consumer products, including cos-metics. The widespread use of BP-3 has resulted in its release into the water environment, and hence its potentialimpact on aquatic ecosystem is of concern. To better understand the risk associated with BP-3 in aquatic ecosys-
tems, we conducted a thorough review of available articles regarding the physicochemical properties,toxicokinetics, environmental occurrence, and toxic effects of BP-3 and its suspected metabolites. BP-3 is lipophil-ic, photostable, and bioaccumulative, and can be rapidly absorbed via oral and dermal routes. BP-3 is reported tobe transformed into three major metabolites in vivo, i.e., benzophenone-1 (BP-1), benzophenone-8 (BP-8), and2,3,4-trihydroxybenzophenone (THB). BP-1 has a longer biological half-life than its parent compound and ex-hibits greater estrogenic potency in vitro. BP-3 has been detected in water, soil, sediments, sludge, and biota.The maximum detected level in ambient freshwater and seawater is 125 ng/L and 577.5 ng/L, respectively, andin wastewater in ﬂuent is 10,400 ng/L. The major sources of BP-3 are reported to be human recreational activitiesand wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) ef ﬂuents. BP-3 and its derivatives have been also detected in ﬁsh lipid.
In humans, BP-3 has been detected in urine, serum, and breast milk samples worldwide. BP-1 has also been de-tected in placental tissues of delivering women. While sunscreens and cosmetics are known to be major sourcesof exposure, the fact that BP-3 has been detected frequently among young children and men suggests othersources. An increasing number of in vitro studies have indicated the endocrine disrupting capacity of BP-3.Based on a receptor binding assay, BP-3 has shown strong anti-androgenic and weak estrogenic activities butat the same time BP-3 displays anti-estrogenic activity as well. Predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) forBP-3 was derived at 1.32 μg/L. The levels observed in ambient water are generally an order of magnitudelower than the PNEC, but in wastewater in ﬂuents, hazard quotients (HQs) greater than 1 were noted. Consideringlimited ecotoxicological information and signi ﬁcant seasonal and spatial variations of BP-3 in water, further stud-
ies on environmental monitoring and potential consequences of long-term exposure in aquatic ecosystem arewarranted.© 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Contents1 .

IntroductionExposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation may pose a public health threat,including the risk of various skin di seases such as sunburn, photo-agingand skin cancers ( Pathak, 1987 ). While solar UVC (wavelength range200–280 nm) is absorbed by ozone in the stratosphere, UVA(320– 400 nm) and UVB (290 –320 nm) can reach the earth surface andtherefore may in ﬂuence humans and ecosystems ( Clydesdale et al.,2001; de Gruijl, 2002 ). Long-wave UVA comprises more than 90% ofsolar light, and can penetrate deep into both the epidermis and dermisof the skin eventually causing premature photo-aging. UVB is a minorcomponent in proportion, but is more active and more capable of causingsunburn than UVA. UVB is considered to be responsible for inducing DNA
damage and ultimately skin cancer ( Svobodová et al., 2003 ). The concernover the deleterious effects of solar UV light has increased the demand forsunscreen products. Consequently, sunscreen products, commonly re-ferred to as UV ﬁlters, have been widely used to reduce sunlight exposureand to protect human skin.Based on composition, UV ﬁlters can be classi ﬁed roughly into twogroups, i.e., organic (or chemical) and inorganic (or physical). Inorganicﬁlters include mineral particles such as TiO2and ZnO, and function byreﬂecting and scattering UV light from the skin. On the other hand, or-ganic ﬁlters usually possess aromatic structures that can absorb and sta-bilize the solar UV radiation ( Gasparro et al., 1998 ). Benzophenones(BPs), camphors, and cinnamates are among well-known organic UV ﬁl-ters. These chemical ﬁlters are generally used in combination becauseno single active agent, used at levels currently permitted by legislation,
would provide suf ﬁcient protection against UV ( Díaz-Cruz et al., 2008;U.S. FDA Department of Health and Human Services, 2013a ). UV ﬁltersare also used in other cosmetic products such as lipsticks, skin lotions,facial creams, and fragrances ( Environmental Working Group, 2013;Liao and Kannan, 2014 ), and in various personal care products, includ-ing shampoos, body washes, toilet soaps, hair sprays, and insectrepellents ( Liao and Kannan, 2014; National Library of Medicine,2011 ), because they can prevent polymer degradation or pigmentation.Benzophenone-3 (BP-3, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone,oxybenzone) is one of the most widely used BP type UV ﬁlters and hasbeen available as a sunscreen agent for over 40 years. BP-3 can beused at levels of up to 5 –6% as an active ingredient in sunscreen inJapan and the U.S.A. ( The Society of Japanese Pharmacopoeia, 1985;U.S. FDA Department of Health and Human Services, 2013b ), while up
to 10% can be used in Europe ( EEC Directive, 1983 ). In Korea, a maxi-mum of 5% BP-3 can be used as a cosmetic ingredient ( Korea Food andDrug Administration, 2012 ). BP-3 is approved by the U.S. Food andDrug Administration also as an indirect food additive ( U.S. FDA Depart-ment of Health and Human Services, 2013a ).Other BP type UV ﬁlters are also commercially used. For example,benzophenone-1 (BP-1, or 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone) which is amajor metabolite of BP-3 in both experimental animals and humans(Kadry et al., 1995; Kunisue et al., 2012; Okereke et al., 1993; Wangand Kannan, 2013 ), is employed as a UV stabilizer in plastic surface coat-ings on food packages ( Suzuki et al., 2005 ).Widespread use of BP-3 has led to the release of this compound andits derivatives into aquatic environment such as lakes and rivers aroundthe world ( Balmer et al., 2005; Cuderman and Heath, 2007; Kamedaet al., 2011; Loraine and Pettigrove, 2006 ). Up to 125 ng/L of BP-3 has
been detected in surface water ( Poiger et al., 2004 ). Wastewater treat-
et al., 2011; Loraine and Pettigrove, 2006 ). Up to 125 ng/L of BP-3 hasbeen detected in surface water ( Poiger et al., 2004 ). Wastewater treat-ment plant (WWTP) ef ﬂuents are reported to contain higher levels ofBP-3 ( Loraine and Pettigrove, 2006 ). Therefore, the potential impacton aquatic ecosystems is of concern.BP-3 has been frequently reported for endocrine disruption ( Fentet al., 2008; Heneweer et al., 2005; Kunz et al., 2006; Schreurs et al.,2002; Sieratowicz et al., 2011 ). Experimental animal and in vitro studieshave shown that BP-3 in ﬂuences reproduction and sex hormone signal-ing ( Blair et al., 2000; Kunz et al., 2006; Schlumpf et al., 2001; Schreurset al., 2005; Schultz et al., 2000; Suzuki et al., 2005 ). BP-1 is reported toTable 1Structure and some physico-chemical properties of benzophenone-3 and its relevant derivatives.Compound CAS.numberAbbreviation Chemical structure Formula MolecularweightBoilingpoint(°C)LogKowapKaaVaporpressurea

possess even greater estrogen receptor binding af ﬁnity compared to BP-3(Kunz et al., 2006; Molina-Molina et al., 2008 ). Furthermore, BP-3 andBP-1 are suspected to in ﬂuence on hormone-dependent diseases, andare associated with the birth outcome of humans ( Kunisue et al.,2012; Wolff et al., 2008 ).This paper reviews the available literature on various aspects of BP-3and its major metabolites, including their chemical properties,toxicokinetics, environmental occurrence, endocrine disrupting poten-tial, and ecological risks. Knowledge gaps, environmental health impli-cations, and the future direction of research are identi ﬁed.2. Characterization of BP-3 and its major derivatives2.1. Physico-chemical properties and fatesBP has two benzene rings joined by a carbonyl group. Twelvesubstituted derivatives of BP, i.e., BP-1 to BP-12, have been used in var-ious commercial products because of their UV absorption properties
(Park et al., 2013 ). Among them, BP-3 is the most well-known com-pound. The physico-chemical properties of BP-3 and its relevant BP de-rivatives are shown in Table 1 .As with other organic UV ﬁlters, BP-3 is a photostable, lipophilic andpotentially bioaccumulative compound. The relatively high log-Kowvalue of BP-3, i.e., 4.0, suggests its slow biodegradation, tendency to ad-sorb to suspended solids and sediments, and low volatilization potentialfrom water surfaces. BP-3 has been shown to degrade by about 4% after28 d in water ( Chemicals Inspection and Testing Institute, 1992 ) indi-cating its persistence in aquatic environment. During summer, thehalf-life of BP-3 in surface water was estimated at a few weeks, andthe persistence appeared to be 7 to 9 times greater in winter undermid-latitude conditions ( Vione et al., 2013 ). In oxic conditions, BP-3 isreported to produce BP-1 as a biodegradation product ( Liu et al.,
2012 ). The biodegradation of BP-3 is favored under anaerobic (4.2 dhalf-life) compared to aerobic conditions (10.7 d half-life). BP-3 is rela-tively stable under UV light and arti ﬁcial sunlight ( Gago-Ferrero et al.,2012; Rodil et al., 2009a ).BP-1 has lower log-Kow value (3.15) and bioconcentration factor(BCF) compared to its parent compound. Unlike BP-3, BP-1 isreadily photodegraded, and disappears after 24 h under UV radiation(Gago-Ferrero et al., 2012 ). Another BP derivative is 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzophenone (THB), but this compound has not been com-mercially used. THB has never been detected in environmental media.BP-8 (2,2 ′-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, dioxybenzone), an-other metabolic product of BP-3, has similar chemical properties toBP-3 and is often detected in soil or sediments due to its highlipophilicity. Analytical methods for BP-3 and its derivatives are beyondthe scope of this review, and related information can be found in Díaz-
Cruz et al. (2008) andGiokas et al. (2007) .2.2. ToxicokineticsBP-3 can be rapidly absorbed after oral, intravenous, or topical skinadministration in rats and piglets ( El Dareer et al., 1986; Kadry et al.,1995; Kasichayanula et al., 2007; Okereke et al., 1993 ). In male rats,BP-3, BP-1, and BP-8 were detected in plasma 5 min after gavage feed-ing ( Okereke et al., 1993 ) and the absorption half-life was 0.71 h(Kadry et al., 1995 ). Maximum plasma concentration of BP-3 wasfound at 2 h after the topical skin application of BP-3 contained sun-screen products in piglets ( Kasichayanula et al., 2007 ). In humans, mil-ligrams of BP-3 were absorbed to systemic circulation following atopical application of sunscreen products containing BP-3 ( Haydenet al., 1997; Janjua et al., 2004 ). While a skin permeability coef ﬁcientof BP-3 is not available, it was shown that about 1 to 2% of the topicallyapplied amount could be absorbed through skin over 10 h period
(Hayden et al., 1997 ).Absorbed BP-3 can be hydroxylated to form metabolic byproductssuch as BP-1, BP-8, or THB ( Jeon et al., 2008; Kasichayanula et al.,
(Hayden et al., 1997 ).Absorbed BP-3 can be hydroxylated to form metabolic byproductssuch as BP-1, BP-8, or THB ( Jeon et al., 2008; Kasichayanula et al.,2005; Nakagawa and Suzuki, 2002; Okereke et al., 1993 ). Of these me-tabolites, BP-1 has been most frequently detected in rats ( El Dareeret al., 1986; Okereke et al., 1993 ). BP-1 is formed via O-demethylationof the methoxy side chain on ring A of BP-3, whereas BP-8 is formedvia the aromatic hydroxylation of ring B at the ortho position. A smallportion of BP-1 can be further converted into THB via the aromatic hy-droxylation of ring A at the meta position ( Fig. 1 ).Even though the study on the toxicokinetics of BP-3 tends to be limit-ed to the experiments using rats after oral administration, BP-1 is also be-lieved to be one of the major metabolites of BP-3 in ﬁsh. During a 14 dexposure of adult male zebra ﬁsh to BP-3, only BP-1 and BP-3 were detect-ed in water and ﬁsh samples while BP-2, 4,4 ′-dihyroxybenzophenone,
and 4-hydroxybenzophenone (4-OH-BP) were not found ( Bluthgenet al., 2012 ). In addition, as the nominal concentration of BP-3 in ﬁsh de-creased, the ratio between the concentrations of BP-1 to BP-3 in ﬁsh nota-bly increased. Increased proportion of BP-1 may explain greaterendocrine disrupting potential at lower BP-3 concentrations in ﬁsh. Incontrast to the adult male ﬁsh, biotransformation of BP-3 to BP-1 hadnot occurred in hatched fry ﬁsh at 5 days post-hatch (dph). Less devel-oped metabolic functions at the eleuthero-embryo stage may accountfor this observation.BP-1 is also the major metabolite in humans. Among women (n =625 from Utah and California, U.S.A.), a positive correlation ( β=0 . 5 9 ,Fig. 1. Metabolic pathways of benzophenone-3 in rats.145 S. Kim, K. Choi / Environment International 70 (2014) 143 –157
r = 0.92) was found between BP-3 and BP-1 concentrations in urinesamples with BP-1 levels notably high ( Kunisue et al., 2012 ). The pro-ﬁles of BP derivatives in human urine suggest that demethylation toBP-1 is the major metabolic pathway ( Wang and Kannan, 2013 ). How-ever, other types of BPs, e.g., BP-2 and 4-OH-BP which were not detectedin animal studies, have been found in human urine. Some of the BPsmight have originated from the direct use of those compounds butalso might be explained by human-speci ﬁc metabolism of BP-3. Inurines collected from the children and adults of the U.S.A., the total con-centrations of four BP derivatives including BP-1, BP-2, BP-8, and 4-OH-BP were positively correlated with the concentration of BP-3 ( Wang andKannan, 2013 ). Interestingly, a recent study ( Zhang et al., 2013 )r e p o r t -ed no signi ﬁcant correlations between urinary BP-3 and 4-OH-BP con-
centrations, suggesting sources other than BP-3. Sex dependentdifferences in metabolism have been reported. After repeated topicalapplication of BP-3, blood and urine concentrations of BP-3 in menwere higher than in women ( Janjua et al., 2008 ).Like other ketonic compounds ( Westphal, 1986 ), BP derivatives bindwith plasma proteins and are transported through blood vessels. Afteroral administration of BP-3 in male Sprague –Dawley rats, tissue analysisat 6 h revealed that BP-1 was present in most tissues including the liver,kidney, testes, intestine, spleen and skin ( Okereke et al., 1993 ). Usingthe same study design, Kadry et al. (1995) demonstrated that livercontained the highest concentrations of total and free BP-3, in theliver, 6.47% and 0.18% of the initial total and free BP-3 doses were de-tected, followed by the kidney with 0.97% and 0.02%, respectively. Asimilar distribution pattern was found also for BP-1 ( Okereke et al.,
1993 ). High levels of both BP-3 and BP-1 in liver samples imply thatthe liver is a major organ of BP-3 biotransformation. In hepatocyte sus-pensions, BP-3 can be converted enzymatically to BP-1 and probably toBP-8 ( Nakagawa and Suzuki, 2002 ). While it is uncertain which en-zymes exactly are responsible for the metabolism of BP-3, cytochromeP450 (CYP) enzymes are thought to play a role ( Porter and Coon,1991 ). In rat liver microsomes, the oxidation to BP-1 was mainly cata-lyzed by CYP2C6 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A1 ( Kamikyoudenet al., 2013 ). However, metabolism of BP-3 in ﬁsh may be different, be-cause ﬁsh lack CYP2C homologs ( Smith et al., 2010 ). In the brain of malezebra ﬁsh, transcripts of cyp1a1 were signi ﬁcantly up-regulated by ex-posure to BP-3 ( Bluthgen et al., 2012 ) suggesting the potential role ofthis CYP isozyme in metabolism of BP-3.Conjugation with glucuronic acid and expulsion in the urine are one
of the major routes of BP-3 excretion ( El Dareer et al., 1986; Kadry et al.,1995; Okereke et al., 1993 ). In rats, the removal of BP-3 from blood wasreported to be faster than that of BP-1, and the biological half-life of BP-3was determined at 4.58 h ( Jeon et al., 2008 ). Following topical applica-tion on skin in piglets, the elimination half-lives of BP-3 ranged between7.14 and 8.04 h ( Fediuk et al., 2012; Kasichayanula et al., 2005, 2007 ).Prolonged absorption phase through skin may explain longer elimina-tion half-life following topical application.3. Occurrences in environment and biota3.1. Occurrence in aquatic environmentThe concentrations of BP-3 and other UV ﬁlters ﬂuctuate signi ﬁcant-ly by location, levels of public access, season, and sampling conditionssuch as water depth or ﬂow ( Díaz-Cruz et al., 2008; Fent et al., 2010b;Poiger et al., 2004 ). These compounds can reach the ambient waterthrough both direct and indirect inputs. The direct inputs involve re-
moval from the skin during recreational activities such as swimmingor bathing in water bodies. Indirect inputs include releases via
moval from the skin during recreational activities such as swimmingor bathing in water bodies. Indirect inputs include releases viaWWTPs, which may originate for example from processes such as laun-dry or showering ( Balmer et al., 2005; Hernández Leal et al., 2010;Langford and Thomas, 2008 ).In lake Hüttnersee, a recreational lake of Switzerland, notably higherlevels of BP-3 were detected compared to other UV ﬁlters, such as (3-(4-methylbenzylidene) camphor (4-MBC), ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate(EHMC), or octocrylene (OC) ( Balmer et al., 2005 ). Similarly, in a lakeand a swimming pool in Slovenia, BP-3 was present at the highestlevel and frequency among the six UV ﬁlters measured which include4-MBC, OC, octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), octyl dimethyl PABA(OD-PABA), and homosalate ( Cuderman and Heath, 2007 ). In ambientfreshwater, BP-3 has been detected up to 125 ng/L. This maximumlevel was reported in lake Hüttnersee, Switzerland during the summer
of 1998 where no indirect input other than public recreational accesswas expected, and the level was consistent with the predicted valuebased on the survey of sunscreen usage ( Poiger et al., 2004 ). BP-3 wasdetected in other popular outdoor bathing areas. In outdoor swimmingpools (n = 5) and recreational ponds (n = 6) of South Bohemia duringthe peak summer season of 2011, BP-3 has been found at concentrationsas high as 620 and 550 ng/L, respectively ( Grabicova et al., 2013 ). Inbeach seawaters, high levels of BP-3 have been reported. Up to577.5 ng/L BP-3 was found in coastal waters of Majorca Island, Spain,during summer 2011 ( Tovar-Sanchez et al., 2013 ). Higher levels of BP-3 were detected in surface nearshore beach waters of semi-enclosedor densely populated resort areas. These levels are several times greaterthan those reported for rivers or lakes. These observations underline theimportance of human recreational activities as a source of BP-3 in water.
Wastewater ef ﬂuents are another major source of BP-3 into ambientwater, although BP-3 is removed ef ﬁciently (68 to 96%) in conventionalWWTPs ( Balmer et al., 2005; Li et al., 2007 ). BP-3 concentrations inWWTP in ﬂuents and ef ﬂuents ranged from b5 to 10,400 ng/L, with thehighest concentrations reported in a wastewater in ﬂuent at San DiegoCounty in the U.S.A. ( Loraine and Pettigrove, 2006 ). Along the RiverGlatt, Switzerland, BP-3 was ﬁrst detected downstream of the DubendorfWWTP, which indicates the contribution of WWTP as an importantsource of BP-3 release ( Fent et al., 2010b; Zenker et al., 2008 ). In contrast,BP-1 was detected in only one sample (47 ng/L) among 25 river and lakewater samples collected during spring of 2003 in South Korea ( Jeon et al.,2006). BP-1 concentrations of b0.3–17 ng/L were found in the Rivers Taffand Ely in South Wales regions, UK ( Kasprzyk-Hordern et al., 2008 ). The
reason for less frequent detection and lower concentrations of BP-1 inw a t e rc a nb ef o u n df r o mi t sl e s s e rp e r sistence in water compared to BP-3.Although contamination in sediment or soil samples has receivedlesser attention compared to that in natural waters, BP-3 and itsbyproducts are likely to exist at higher levels in sediments or soil dueto their lipophilic properties. Schlenk et al. (2005) performed anin vivo vitellogenin assay for sediment samples collected from theSouthern California Bight, U.S.A. using male or juvenile ﬁsh, and identi-ﬁed the samples with estrogenic potential. From those samples with es-trogenic activity, only BP-3 was unequivocally detected among 62 PPCPanalytes. In soil or sediments, the levels of BP-3 ranged between b0.5 and27 ng/g dw. For BP-1, the levels ranged between 0.26 and 0.61 ng/gdw, and for BP-8, the range was 0.13 and 4.17 ng/g dw. Other BPderivatives, such as BP-2 and 4-OH-BP, have also been detected in the
soil and sediment of the U.S.A. ( Zhang et al., 2011 ).3.2. Occurrence in biota
derivatives, such as BP-2 and 4-OH-BP, have also been detected in thesoil and sediment of the U.S.A. ( Zhang et al., 2011 ).3.2. Occurrence in biotaOnly few studies are available on BP derivatives in aquatic biota. BP-3 and BP-4 have been reported in ﬁsh lipid ( Balmer et al., 2005; Fentet al., 2010b; Zenker et al., 2008 ). Inﬁsh from lakes in Switzerland,BP-3 and 4-MBC were most frequently detected among four UV ﬁlters(Balmer et al., 2005 ).Reports on occurrence of BP-3 and related compounds among bio-logical samples are mostly limited to humans. As shown in Table 3andFig. 2 , BP-3 was detected in the majority of urine samples. In the2003 –2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey(NHANES), BP-3 was found at N0.4μg/L in the urine of 96.8% of 2517participants aged 6 years or older ( Calafat et al., 2008 ). BP-3 was alsofound in breast milk samples from Germany and Switzerland ( Hany
and Nagel, 1995; Schlumpf et al., 2010 ). BP-1 and 4-OH-BP have also146 S. Kim, K. Choi / Environment International 70 (2014) 143 –157

been detected in human samples. Kunisue et al. (2012) reported BP-3 in99.0%, BP-1 in 93.3%, and 4-OH-BP in 83.8% of urine samples (n = 625U.S.A. women). In placental tissue samples of pregnant women, BP-1was present in 87.5% (n = 16) ( Vela-Soria et al., 2011 ). Frequent detec-tion of BP-3 and BP-1 in breast milk or placental tissues implies poten-tial transfer to fetus and breastfed infant. Trans-placental transferratios of BP-3, i.e., 0.48 (geometric mean), were also suggested byZhang et al. (2013) employing whole blood samples.Urinary levels of BP-3 appeared to be affected by several factors. Theurinary concentrations of BP-3 are reported to be higher in females thanin males of the U.S.A. ( Calafat et al., 2008; Ye et al., 2012 ) while no gen-der differences were found in urine of Danish children and adolescents(Frederiksen et al., 2013a ). Furthermore, urinary or serum concentra-
tions of BP-3 tend to be higher in urban mothers and in individuals ofhigher socioeconomic status (SES) ( Frederiksen et al., 2013b; Tyrrellet al., 2013 ), probably re ﬂecting their greater frequency of usage. Differ-ences by sampling countries also have been reported. Detection fre-quencies of BP-3 appeared to be much higher in the U.S.A. and Europe(80.5 –99.0%, Table 3 ) than in Asian countries such as Japan (0%, n =32) and China (25%, n = 100) ( Kunisue et al., 2010; Zhang et al.,2013 ). These results might be attributable to different life styles or tothe different pattern of UV ﬁlter use among countries. For example,both concentrations and detection rates of BP-3 in personal care prod-ucts of the U.S.A. (1200 ng/g product weight with 99.1% of detection fre-quency) were reported higher than those of China (20.1 ng/g productweight, 64.1%) ( Liao and Kannan, 2014 ).Recent studies indicate that BP-3 exposure may occur from sources
other than sunscreens or PCPs ( Krause et al., 2012 ).Frederiksen et al.(2013b) reported BP-3 in almost all urine samples (97 –98%) that werecollected during seasons when sunscreens are not generally used. In ad-dition, in the river or lakes near WWTP, levels of BP-3 in water weregenerally higher during spring or fall than in summer ( Fent et al.,2010b; Rodil et al., 2008 ). BP-3 was detected at a similar frequency asadults in the urines of young children aged 6 –16 years ( Frederiksenet al., 2013a, 2013b ). These observations indicate the presence of BP-3sources other than sunscreen or cosmetics.Dust ingestion is thought to be one of major sources of BP-3 expo-sure. Five types of BPs were detected in indoor dust samples from theTable 4Endocrine disrupting activities of benzophenone-3 and its relevant derivatives in vitro.Compounds Hormonal activity Cell line Assay Endpoints Conc.

U.S.A., China, Japan, and Korea, and the detection rates of BP-3 and BP-1were 100% ( Wang et al., 2013 ). Concentrations of BP-3 in dust were64.5 –1190 ng/g in the U.S.A. and 9.72 –1690 ng/g in Korea.4. Adverse effects of BP-3 in vitro and in vivo4.1. Endocrine disruption potentials in vitroA number of in vitro studies indicate that UV ﬁl t e r ss u c ha sB P - 3 ,4 -MBC, OMC, and OD-PABA have endocrine-disrupting capacities ( Gomezet al., 2005; Kunz and Fent, 2006b; Morohoshi et al., 2005; Schlumpfet al., 2001; Schreurs et al., 2005 ).Table 4 summarizes endocrinedisrupting activities of BP-3 and its metabolites reported from in vitrostudies.BP-3 was determined to be slightly estrogenic in an MCF-7 humanbreast cancer cell proliferation assay and pS2 protein assay; the maxi-mal MCF-7 cell count increase was 95.09% of 17 β-estradiol (E2) andthe maximal weight increase was 7.60% of 17 α-ethinylestradiol (EE2)
(Schlumpf et al., 2001 ). Weak estrogenicity of BP-3 was also found ina yeast bioassay transfected with estrogen receptor (ER), estrogen re-sponsive elements (ERE), and a lacZreporter gene ( Miller et al., 2001 ).BP-1, a major metabolite of BP-3, was found to possess strongerestrogenicity than its parent compound. Molina-Molina et al. (2008) ex-amined four types of BP derivatives for the transcription activation to-ward ERs. BP-1 and other BP derivatives such as BP2 and THB hadconsiderably lower EC50 values than those of BP-3 in MELN (MCF-7-ERE-Luciferase-Neo) and HELN (HeLa-ERE-Luciferase-Neo) cell lines.In a similar human breast cell line, MCF-7 cells, BP-1 induced cellproliferation at concentrations of 0.01 –1μM, whereas BP-3 did notinduce the proliferation even at 100 μM(Nakagawa and Suzuki,2002). In a yeast two-hybrid assay, Kawamura et al. (2003) report-
ed that estrogenic activities of BP-3 and its metabolites were in theorder of BP-1 NTHB≫BP-3 NBP-8. Relative to E2, estrogenic activity ofBP-1 was calculated at 1/5000 fold, while that of BP-3 was 1/45,000 foldin an in vitro yeast sex hormone receptor transactivation study (Kunz andFent, 2006b ). For BP-8 and THB, signi ﬁcant MCF-7 cell proliferation wasfound ( Nakagawa and Suzuki, 2002 ) although estrogenic activity ofBP-8 was not evident in a yeast bioassay ( Kawamura et al., 2003;Miller et al., 2001 ). The ER binding af ﬁnity of BPs could be explainedby the hydroxyl group at the para-position of BP (Kawamura et al.,2003; Miller et al., 2001; Schultz et al., 2000 ).BP-3 can also elicit both antiestrogenic ( Molina-Molina et al., 2008;Schreurs et al., 2002 ) and antiandrogenic activities ( Ma et al., 2003;Nashev et al., 2010; Schreurs et al., 2005; Suzuki et al., 2005 ) in vitro.Antiestrogenic activity of BP-3 was calculated at 1/45 fold relative to
that of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and antiandrogenic activity relative toﬂutamide was calculated at 1/1.3 fold in an in vitro yeast sex hormonereceptor transactivation assay ( Kunz and Fent, 2006b ). However, con-ﬂicting results have often been published regarding the antiestrogenicpotential of BP-3: BP-3 showed no antagonistic effects at both humanERα(hERα)a n dh E R βtransfected in human embryonal kidney(HEK293) cell line ( Schreurs et al., 2002 ). Different binding af ﬁnitiesto ERs by species may explain such inconsistency ( Krause et al., 2012 ).For BP-1, strong estrogenic and antiandrogenic activities were detected.The binding af ﬁnity of BP-3 appears to also vary depending on the ERsubtype, e.g., ER αand ER β(Molina-Molina et al., 2008; Schreurs et al.,2002, 2005 ). In HEK293 cells, the EC50 value of transactivation forhERαwas one order of magnitude lower than for hER β(Schreurset al., 2005 ). Estrogenic activity of BP-1 is likely to be ER αmediated
rather than ER β(Park et al., 2013 ). ERαactivation is related to the cellproliferation while ER βis reported to play an important role in cell dif-ferentiation ( Förster et al., 2002; Helguero et al., 2005 ).
proliferation while ER βis reported to play an important role in cell dif-ferentiation ( Förster et al., 2002; Helguero et al., 2005 ).A few in vitro studies have been performed to understand theestrogenicity of BP-3 in ﬁsh. Based on a recombinant yeast assay ex-pressing rainbow trout ER α(rtER α)a sw e l la sh E R α(Kunz et al.,2006 b;Molina-Molina et al., 2008 ), BP-1 displayed the highest bindingafﬁnity to both ﬁsh and human receptors among 23 UV ﬁlters. The bind-ing activity of BP-3 was relatively higher in rtER αthan in hER α(Kunzet al., 2006 ).Toxicity interactions of UV ﬁlter mixtures are of concern because UVﬁlters are generally used in combination and are present as such in theaquatic environment ( Heneweer et al., 2005; Kunz and Fent, 2006a ). Es-trogenic compounds are expected to interact additively if they possesssimilar modes of action ( Kortenkamp, 2007 ). Binary mixtures of BP-3
and BP-1, and a multi-component mixture of BP-1, BP-3, OMC, and 4-MBC showed additivity in ER binding in MCF-7 cells ( Heneweer et al.,200 5). While these observations suggest similar modes of endocrinedisruption among BP based UV ﬁlters, other types of mixture interac-tions have also been reported. A tertiary mixture of BP-1, BP-2 and 3-benzylidene camphor (3BC) displayed additivity at high concentrationsbut antagonism at lower concentrations, in terms of ﬁsh vitellogenesis(Kunz and Fent, 2009 ). Contrary to these reports, synergistic estrogenicactivities were detected for mixtures of four or eight UV ﬁlters in a re-combinant yeast assay with hER α, indicating signi ﬁcant interactionsamong UV ﬁlters ( Kunz and Fent, 2006a ). Further investigation on themodes of action of BP-3 in mixture is warranted.Table 5Endocrine disrupting activities of benzophenone-3 and its relevant derivatives in vivo.Compounds Hormonal activity Assay Experimental animals Exposure

4.2. Endocrine disruption and other adverse effects in vivoRelatively limited information is available on endocrine disruptionof BPs in experimental animals ( Table 5 ). Some hydroxylated BPs haveproduced both estrogen agonistic and antagonistic activities in an im-mature rat uterotrophic assay, but no antiandrogenic activity was ob-served in a Hershberger assay ( Yamasaki et al., 2003 ). Compared to 4-MBC and OMC, uterotrophic effects of BP-3 in an ovariectomized ratare negligible ( Schlecht et al., 2004; Schlumpf et al., 2001; Suzukiet al., 2005 ). BP-3 was also reported for signi ﬁcant down-regulation oferαmRNA in pituitary, and reduced erβexpression in uterus of femaleSprague –Dawley rats ( Schlecht et al., 2004 ). However, BP-1 appearedto have signi ﬁcant uterotrophic effects ( Koda et al., 2005 ). BP-1 expo-sure stimulated the growth of BG-1 human ovarian cancer cells in theabsence of endogenous ovarian estrogen in xenograft mouse models
(Park et al., 2013 ). Based on an ER competitive-binding assay inSprague –Dawley rats, estrogenic potential of BP-1 is also evidentwhile those for BP-3 and BP-8 were not observed ( Blair et al., 2000 ).These reports are generally consistent with the results of the in vitrostudies.For aquatic organisms, several studies have reported the adverse ef-fects of BP-3 on reproduction and development ( Table 6 ). Adverse acuteand chronic effects on algae ( Scenedesmus vacuolatus andDesmodesmussubspicatus ), the freshwater ﬂea ( Daphnia magna ) and planarian(Dugesia japonica ) have been reported for BP-3 ( Fent et al., 2010a; Li,2012; Rodil et al., 2009a; Sieratowicz et al., 2011 ). BP-3 can alter the ex-pression of an endocrine signaling gene, ultraspiracle (USP)i nt h ea q u a t -ic invertebrate, Chironomus riparius (Ozaez et al., 2013 ).A 21 d exposure to 620 μg/L BP-3 led to a decrease of reproduction
and hatching success in Japanese medaka ( Oryzias latipes ). Theexposure to a positive chemical, i.e., 0.05 μg/L E2, also led to the similarreproduction damages ( Coronado et al., 2008 ). VTG induction by BP-3varies by ﬁsh species. VTG concentrations in plasma samples frommale Japanese medaka and rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss )i n -creased by 21 d exposure to 620 μg/L and 14 d exposure to 749 μg/L, re-spectively ( Coronado et al., 2008 ). In contrast, no signi ﬁca nt alterationsof plasma or whole body VTG were observed in male zebra ﬁsh (Daniorerio) and juvenile fathead minnow ( Pimephales promelas ) at concentra-tions of BP-3 as high as 312 and 3900 μg/L, respectively ( Bluthgen et al.,2012; Kunz et al., 2006 ), while exposure to 0.1 μg/L E2 induced VTG inthe same ﬁsh (Kunz et al., 2006 ). The interspecies differences in VTGsynthesis by chemical exposure have already been reported by Vanden Belt et al. (2003) . The variation among species might be also ex-
plained in part by differences in the metabolic rate of BP-3 into BP-1.BP-1 induced VTG synthesis in juvenile fathead minnows at concentra-tions of 4919 μg/L ( Kunz et al., 2006 ). The estrogenic activity of BP-3such as VTG induction reported in certain aquatic species, could there-fore be at least in part attributed to its metabolic product, i.e., BP-1, rath-er than by BP-3 alone which has shown only weak estrogenic activitiesin many in vitro studies. Among other BP derivatives, BP-2 has been re-ported to cause VTG induction and adverse reproduction effects in adultfathead minnows at high level of exposure ranging between 1200 and9700 μg/L (Weisbrod et al., 2007 ).Low level BP-3 can also inhibit steroidogenesis and affect hormonalpathways in male zebra ﬁsh (Bluthgen et al., 2012 ). Upon exposure to84μg/L BP-3, steroidogenic enzymes including 17β-hsd were down-regulated, implying both antiestrogenic and antiandrogenic activities
of BP-3 in the zebra ﬁsh. BP-1 is also believed to inhibit human 17β-HSD3 , and therefore could possibly reduce testosterone production
of BP-3 in the zebra ﬁsh. BP-1 is also believed to inhibit human 17β-HSD3 , and therefore could possibly reduce testosterone production(Nashev et al., 2010 ).

could also alter the expression of the genes involved in steroidogenesisin zebra ﬁsh (Zucchi et al., 2011 ).5. Ecological risk assessmentTo estimate the potential risk of BP-3 in aquatic environment, weperformed an ecological risk assessment based on the available infor-mation, following European Commission (2003) . In order to derive thepredicted no-effect concentration (PNEC), only ecotoxicological datathat are related to ecologically meaningful endpoints, e.g., survival,growth, or reproduction, were selected from the available toxicologicalinformation ( Table 6 ), and were listed in Table 7 . Considering theamount of available toxicological information, a factor applicationmethod which employs an assessment factor, was used to derivePNEC. As relevant toxicological information currently available includesonly two chronic toxicity values from algae and water ﬂea (Table 7 ), anassessment factor of 100 was chosen based on European Commission
(2003) . While results of 21 d ﬁsh exposure studies are often consideredas chronic toxicity value (e.g., Fent et al., 2010a ), we did not consider theresults of the 21 d adult ﬁsh exposure test ( Coronado et al., 2008 )a s“chronic ”. This was because a chronic toxicity test should include atleast 10% of the organism's life span as an exposure duration ( Suterand Barnthouse, 1993 ), or should include early life stage of the organism(Stephen et al., 1985 ).Based on a hatchability no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) of132μg/L in O. latipes following 21 d exposure of F0 ( Coronado et al.,2008 ) and an assessment factor of 100, the PNEC was determined at1.32μg/L. This PNEC, however, should be used with caution, becausethis value reﬂ ects only the current knowledge of ecotoxicological infor-mation of BP-3, and is likely to be re ﬁned in the future with forthcomingtoxicological data.Hazard quotient (HQ) derived based on the measured environmen-
tal concentrations (MECs, Table 2 ) implies that direct impact of BP-3would be negligible at the current levels in ambient waters ( Table 8 ).However, in hotspots, e.g., wastewater in ﬂuents of the U.S.A. andSwitzerland, the HQ values for BP-3 often exceeded unity. For example,in wastewater in ﬂuent in San Diego County, U.S.A., BP-3 was detected atas high as 10.4 μg/L (Loraine and Pettigrove, 2006 ), of which HQ is closeto 8. Since the level of this compound varies by season and by human ac-tivities, and relatively limited information is available for environmentaloccurrences of this compound, systematic monitoring program andthorough toxicological studies are warranted to better understandrisks of BP-3 in the aquatic environment.6. Conclusion and future researchWidespread use of BP-3 in various personal care products includingsunscreens and cosmetics, and its frequent detection in both water en-vironment and biota have raised concerns on ecological risks of this
compound. BP-3 and other BP derivatives have shown multiple endo-crine disrupting activities. Animal studies have shown that BP-3 couldbebiotransformed into its hydroxylated forms, and some of whichcould exhibit greater estrogenic af ﬁnity both in vivo and in vitro.Based on the available in vivo toxicity studies, and the levels occurringin ambient water, BP-3 likely poses a negligible risk to freshwater eco-systems except for some hotspot areas. However, temporal and spatialpattern of environmental occurrences of BP-3 and its derivatives arenot well understood. In addition, ecotoxicological information onlong-term exposure to BP-3 and related derivatives is limited. Consider-ing continuous release of this group of compounds into the water aswell as their bioaccumulative potential, consequences following long-term exposure of aquatic organisms warrant further investigation.AcknowledgmentThis study was supported by the National Research Foundation of
