89Chapter 6Isolation and Purification of Exosomes in UrinePatricia A. Gonzales, Hua Zhou, Trairak Pisitkun, Nam Sun Wang,  Robert A. Star, Mark A. Knepper, and Peter S.T. YuenAbstractExosomes represent an important and readily isolated subset of the urinary proteome that has the potential to shed much insight on the health status of the kidney. Each segment of the nephron sheds exosomes into the urine. Exosomes are rich in potential biomarkers, especially membrane proteins such as trans-porters and receptors that may be up- or downregulated during disease states. Two differential centrifu-gation methods are available for simple purification of exosomes: one uses ultracentrifugation, and the other uses a nanomembrane concentrator. Validation methods include western blots of pan-exosome markers and segment-specific exosome markers, and negative staining electron microscopy.
Key words: Exosomes, Endocytosis, Biomarker, Proteomics, Uromodulin/Tamm-Horsfall protein, Podocyte, UltracentrifugationUrinary exosomes are protein-containing vesicles (<100 nm) that originate from glomerular podocytes or epithelial cells lining the renal tubules (1). After endocytosis from the plasma membrane, endocytic vesicles, which have an inside-out orientation, can fuse with the outer membrane of a multivesicular body (MVB). The outer membrane of MVB can invaginate, generating internal ves-icles that have a right side-out orientation. When the outer mem-brane of a MVB fuses with the plasma membrane of a podocyte or the apical plasma membrane of a renal epithelial cell, the vesi-cles are released from the cell into the urinary space as exosomes. Proteins, such as ALIX and TSG101, which are involved in the maturation of MVB, have been found through the proteomic analysis of human urinary exosomes (2). These proteins are used 1. Introduction

90 Gonzales et al.as markers for identifying exosomes. Under normal conditions exosomes originate from podocytes and epithelial cells, where one can detect the presence of proteins that are either segment specific such as aquaporin 2 (AQP2, collecting duct), sodium-proton exchanger 3 (NHE-3, proximal tubule) or podocalyxin (PODXL) found in podocytes.The isolation of these vesicles provides a simple enrichment strategy of potential disease biomarkers by reducing the complex-ity of the urinary proteome with minimal loss of yield or purity. In addition, exosomes are a relatively small proportion of whole urine; isolating exosomes can reduce the amount of high-abundance proteins while enriching low-abundance proteins that may have pathophysiological significance.The collection, storage, and handling of human urine samples have an impact on the isolation of urinary exosomes. Zhou et al. (3) recommend the use of protease inhibitors to preserve exo-
somes-associated proteins. When shipping and/or storage of urine is necessary, it is recommended to freeze fresh urine samples at −80°C instead of −20°C. After thawing, samples should be vortexed extensively to increase recovery of the exosomes from frozen urine. These recommendations will facilitate the use of urinary exosomes in a clinical setting (3).The Tamm-Horsfall protein (uromodulin) is the most abun-dant soluble protein in normal urine, which can interfere with proteomic discovery methods (1). Its polymerization can entrap urinary exosomes and other membrane elements present in the urine. Tamm-Horsfall protein can be depolymerized with reducing agents and heat (Fig. 1), thereby denaturing the zona pellucida (ZP) domains in the Tamm-Horsfall protein (4 ). For validation studies of urinary exosomal biomarkers, depletion of Tamm-Horsfall protein is typically not necessary.We describe two alternative methods for isolation of urinary
exosomes, as well as validation by negative staining electron microscopy (Fig. 2) or by western blot. 1. 1.67 ml 100 mM NaN3. 2. 2.5 ml AEBSF (2.75 mg/ml in ddH2O, stable at 1 week at 4°C, 6 months at −20°C).Or 2. 2.5 ml PMSF (2.5 mg/ml in isopropanol, stable at −20°C). 3. 50 ml Leupeptin (1 mg/ml in dd-H2O, stable 1 week 4°C, 6 months −20°C).2.

94 Gonzales et al.whole cells, casts, and debris. The resulting supernatant fraction is subjected to a second centrifugation step (a) by ultracentrifu-gation at 200,000 × g or (b) by filtration with a commercially available nanomembrane concentrator at 3,000 × g (5). The ultra-centrifugation step is currently the standard method to purify urinary exosomes, but the equipment is not necessarily available, especially in clinical laboratories. Nanomembrane concentrators are commercially available and simplify the isolation procedure, but recovery of exosomal proteins is not uniform, which can pose problem for proteomics discovery experiments, including poten-tially retaining non-exosomal proteins that are aggregates or high molecular weight complexes (5).The nanomembrane concentrator contains a polyethersul-fonate membrane and is manufactured to have a uniform pore size of 13 mm, as opposed to conventionally manufactured cen-
trifugation-based concentrator membranes. Additionally, the ori-entation of the membranes within the receptacle minimizes the shearing forces that can introduce artifacts. The weakness of the method is that the recovery of proteins from the concentrator is reproducible for a given protein, but varies from one protein to another. This variation may be due to differential trapping of exo-some subpopulations and/or non-specific binding of proteins and exosomes to the membrane (5). 1. Add protease inhibitors to urine sample. 2. Centrifuge urine sample at 17,000 × g for 10  min at 25°C for fresh urine, or at 4°C for previously frozen urine (see Note 5). 3. Transfer 17,000 × g supernatant to one or more high speed tubes, and mark each tube so that the expected location of the pellet on the tube can be found after the spin. 4. Ultracentrifuge the supernatant at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 25°C, or at 4°C for previously frozen urine (see Notes 6, 7).
5. Discard supernatant and resuspend the first tube’s pellet (typ-ically light yellow, but not always visible for lower volumes) with isolation solution. Vortex for 30 s, and transfer the sus-pension (as much as possible) to the second tube, resuspend pellet and repeat for every tube (see Notes 8, 9, and 10). 1. Remove glycerol and other preservatives by washing with one volume of PBS, centrifuge at 3,000 × g in a swinging bucket rotor at 25°C (see Note 11). 2. Centrifuge the urine samples at 17,000 × g for 10 min and at 25°C for fresh urine, and at 4°C for previously frozen urine. 3. Add 20 ml of urine supernatant to nanomembrane concen-trator.

Reconstitute gel pieces on ice or at 4°C for 30 min. Remove the remaining trypsin solution contain-ing excess trypsin. Wash briefly with 50 µl of 25 mM NH4HCO3 (just add and remove) to remove the trypsin
on the outside of the gel pieces. Add 50 µl of 25 mM NH4HCO3 to cover gel pieces (see Note 16).(b) Spin briefly and incubate at 37°C overnight (see Note 17). 5. Extraction of peptides.(a) Transfer the digest solution (aqueous extraction) into a clean 1.5 ml tube.(b) To the gel pieces, add 30 µl (or enough volume to cover gel pieces) of 50% ACN/0.5% FA, vortex and stand for 30 min sonicate for 5 min in a water bath, and spin.

Updated protocols can be found at the UroProt website: http:/ /intramural.niddk.nih.gov/research/uroprot/.Protease Inhibitors 2. As an alternative to PMSF, AEBSF offers lower toxicity, improved solubility in water, and improved stability in aque-ous solutions. 3. The Sigma P2714 protease inhibitor cocktail should be stored in small aliquots at −20°C.
4. The Roche Complete Mini tablets need to be stored at 4°C. When dissolving the tablet, vortex the sample thoroughly. 5. For fresh urine, maintain the sample at room temperature to avoid Tamm-Horsfall protein precipitation at cold tempera-tures (4°C or on ice). Tamm-Horsfall protein aggregates can trap exosomes and decrease recovery. For previously frozen samples, yield can be drastically reduced unless thawed samples are vigorously mixed.Ultracentrifugation 6. The second step removes whole cells, large membrane frag-ments, and other debris. We use the Sorvall RC2-B refriger -ated centrifuge and a SS-34 rotor and tubes.4. Notes
98 Gonzales et al. 7. Each step should be kept consistent by keeping the number of tubes used per sample the same. 8. After the ultracentrifugation step: To increase the yield of exosomes, discard supernatant, transfer another 8 ml of 17,000 × g supernatant to the same high speed tube, vortex, and then repeat ultracentrifuge at above setting. We use the Beckman L8-70M ultracentrifuge with the 70.1 Ti rotor. The high speed tube we use is the thick-walled, polycarbonate tube #355630 from Beckman. 9. The volume of isolation solution used is 50 ml for 100 ml of urine and 100 ml for 200 ml of urine. To remove Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) from the exosomes, discard superna-tant, to each tube add 50 ml isolation solution, vortex 30 s, and pool all samples in an eppendorf tube. Add DTT to the sample to a final concentration of 200 mg/ml, and incubate at 95°C for 2 min. Transfer the suspension to a high speed tube, fill up isolation solution to 8 ml, and repeat ultracen-
trifugation. Discard supernatant; resuspend the pellet in 50 ml isolation solution (see Fig. 1). 10. The least number of tubes used in the ultracentrifugation step increases exosome recovery. Otherwise, resuspension is harder when more tubes are used. However, there is a trade-off between using fewer tubes and more spins. For example, one spin with five tubes would be faster, but lower yield. On the other extreme, five consecutive spins with one tube would maximize yield, but would be very time-consuming. Two spins in three tubes would be a reasonable compromise.Nanomembrane 11. Prewashing with 1× PBS is essential for the preparation of the nanomembrane concentrator. Without a prewash step, there would be a large variability of urinary exosome yield (4).In-Gel Digestion 12. Wearing non-latex gloves, wipe down ALL areas with 70% ethanol, including the outside of all your tubes, the outside and inside of the Vacuum Dryer, centrifuge, tube racks, bot-
tles, etc. Wipe razor blades with ethanol. 13. 20 mg trypsin (1 vial) in 1.6 ml 25 mM NH4HCO3. Dissolve trypsin in ice-cold buffer (to reduce auto-proteolysis). Diluted enzyme solutions should be freshly made or aliquot (50 µl/tube) and stored at −80°C for later uses. Do not freeze-thaw more than once. 14. In step 1, a small gel particle size facilitates the removal of SDS (and coomassie) during the washes, and improves enzyme access to the gel. 15. In step 2(b), beware not to suck up the gel pieces.
99 Isolation and Purification of Exosomes in Urine 16. In step 4(a), this volume will vary from sample to sample, but on average approx. 5–25 µl is sufficient. 17. In step 4(b), the time to digest is anywhere between 4 h and overnight. 18. In steps 6(a)–6(f), the resin bed of the ZipTip® provides back pressure, so set pipette to 10 µl, depress plunger to a dead stop and slowly release or dispense plunger throughout the entire ZipTip® procedure.References 1.
