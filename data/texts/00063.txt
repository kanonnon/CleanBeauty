DNA Repair and Cytokine ResponsesThomas Schwarz1and Agatha Schwarz1As sunscreens do not provide complete protectionagainst solar/UV radiation, alternative protective stra-tegies are necessary to cope with the increasingincidence of skin cancer. These strategies includethe reduction of UVR-induced DNA damage by thetopical application of bacterial DNA repair enzymes.Recent evidence suggests that nucleotide excisionrepair, the physiological repair system that is mostlyresponsible for the removal of UVR-mediated DNAdamage, can be modulated by cytokines, includingIL-12, IL-18, and a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone.The mechanisms involved and the biological as well asthe potential therapeutic implications of these find-ings are discussed.Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings (2009) 14,63–66; doi:10.1038/jidsymp.2009.3INTRODUCTION
63–66; doi:10.1038/jidsymp.2009.3INTRODUCTIONUltraviolet radiation (UVR), in particular UVB, with awavelength range between 290 and 320 nm, represents one,if not the most, important environmental factor among theinducible health hazards for mankind. These include theinduction of skin cancer, suppression of the immune system,and premature skin aging. There is a substantial increase in theincidence of UVR-induced skin cancer, one of the mostcommon malignancies in people of Caucasian descent, both inthe United States and in Europe (Gloster and Brodland, 1996).The basic event in photocarcinogenesis is the induction ofDNA damage by UVR. UVB induces primarily two typesof DNA lesions, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and(6-4)-photoproducts. Induction of DNA lesions is a commonevent, occurring upon exposure to rather low, non-erythemato-genic doses. The majority of these lesions are usually removedby nucleotide excision repair (NER), a complex repair process
(de Laat et al., 1999). The efficacy and the importance of NERare best shown by the disease xeroderma pigmentosum. Owingto genetic mutations in specific c omponents of NER, xerodermapigmentosum patients are sever ely impaired in their DNA repaircapacity and, as a consequence, experience a dramatically(1,000-fold) increased incidence of skin cancer at early ages(Kraemer et al., 1994).However, there may be therapeutic hope for thesepatients. Other species, such as bacteria, also repair UVR-induced DNA damage, using other repair systems. Bacteriaremove UVR-induced DNA damage using an enzyme calledT4N5 endonuclease, marsupials using an enzyme calledphotolyase. Although not expressed in human cells, theserepair enzymes repair equally well when delivered into
human cells. A major breakthrough in this respect wasachieved by the incorporation of these non-human repairenzymes into special liposomes, which enabled penetrationinto human cells and, even more importantly, into humanskin when applied topically (Yarosh et al ., 1994). Accord-ingly, topical application of a T4N5 endonuclease lotionreduced the incidence of skin cancer in chronically UVR-exposed mice (Yarosh et al ., 1992). A multicenter double-blinded study in xeroderma pigmentosum patients revealedthat application of a T4N5 endonuclease-containing lotionreduced significantly the incidence of actinic keratoses, thepre-stage of skin cancer, within a period of 1 year (Yaroshet al., 2001).Other DNA repair enzymes, including photolyase, havebeen shown to remove UVR-induced DNA damage ontopical application, provided that they penetrate into the skinand into the cells (Stege et al., 2000). These exogenous DNA
repair enzymes are also suitable in helping remove UVR-induced DNA damage in normal individuals. This is ofparticular importance, as we have learned in recent years thatconventional sun protection, even by potent sunscreens, isnot fully effective. Therefore, any strategy supporting theremoval of UVR-induced DNA damage after solar exposureshould help to reduce the adverse effects of ambient solarradiation (Lautenschlager et al., 2007).Nature has taken care to provide humans with a system
Nature has taken care to provide humans with a systemother than NER to protect against the consequences of UVR-induced DNA damage. If a cell is so severely damaged byUVR that it cannot remove the majority of DNA lesions,apoptosis is induced, thereby eliminating that cell (Brashet al ., 1996). These apoptotic keratinocytes, called sunburncells, are frequently found in the UVR-exposed epidermis.Induction of UVR-mediated apoptosis seems to be regulatedby the p53 gene (Ziegler et al ., 1994). As p53 eliminatesDNA-damaged cells at risk for malignant transformation, itfunctions as a tumor suppressor gene. Taking this intoaccount, the formation of sunburn cells may be regarded as&2009 The Society for Investigative Dermatology www.jidonline.org 63REVIEWReceived 14 November 2008; accepted 18 December 20081Department of Dermatology, University Kiel, Kiel, GermanyCorrespondence: Dr Thomas Schwarz, Department of Dermatology, University Kiel, Schittenhelmstrasse 7, Kiel 24105, Germany.

a protective mechanism. Therefore, alterations or dysregulationin UVR-induced apoptosis may enhance the risk of develop-ing skin cancer. Hence, whether UVR-induced apoptosis canbe altered from the outside is a relevant question.Cytokines can modulate UVR-induced apoptosisIt was observed that the cytokine, IL-1, enhances UVR-induced apoptosis, proving the hypothesis that cytokines canaffect UVR-induced cell death (Kothny-Wilkes et al., 1999).As IL-1 is induced by UVR, it is tempting to speculate that thismay represent an additional protection mechanism, byeliminating those cells that, although damaged, did not quitemake it into apoptosis. On the basis of this observation, theeffect of other cytokines on UVR-induced apoptosis wasstudied.IL-12 is an immunomodulatory cytokine that plays animportant role in the generation of Th1-driven immuneresponses (Trinchieri, 1993). In addition, IL-12 is able toreverse UVR-induced immunosuppression (Mu ¨ller et al .,
1995; Schmitt et al ., 1995; Schwarz et al ., 1996). It wasmore than surprising to observe that IL-12 significantly alsoreduces UVR-induced apoptosis in vitro (Schwarz et al .,2002). This was confirmed in vivo , as the injection of IL-12into the skin of UVR-exposed mice significantly reduced thenumber of sunburn cells.IL-12 affects DNA repairAt first glance, the above-mentioned discovery indicated IL-12 to be harmful in terms of photocarcinogenesis, as itinhibits UVR-induced apoptosis and thus may allow thesurvival of DNA-damaged cells. However, this was observednot to be the case during an attempt to elucidate themolecular mechanisms underlying this new biologicalactivity of IL-12. When analyzing the amount of UVR-induced DNA damage, which is the major trigger for UVR-induced apoptosis (Kulms et al., 1999), it was noted that theamounts of CPD were reduced significantly in UVR-exposed
cells treated with IL-12. The effect of IL-12 was not becauseof a filtering capacity, as the amounts of CPD were the samein the IL-12 and sham-treated groups, when DNA wasextracted immediately after UVR exposure. This implied thatthe amount of DNA damage is initially the same; however,with increasing time, it decreases in the presence of IL-12.These surprising in vitro findings were also confirmed in vivo ,as immunohistochemical analysis of the UVR-exposedmurine skin revealed significantly reduced amounts of DNAdamage in situ in mice that were injected intracutaneouslywith IL-12 before UVR exposure.The fact that the amount of DNA damage was initially the
same, but with time was reduced significantly in the presenceof IL-12, inspired speculation that IL-12 facilitates theremoval of UVR-induced DNA damage. As UVR-inducedDNA damage is removed primarily by NER in human andmurine cells, it was surmised that IL-12 might influence NER.To test this hypothesis, knockout mice, which were disruptedin the Xpa gene, were used. As the Xpa gene is a criticalcomponent of NER, these animals lack NER completely(de Vries et al., 1995). Intracutaneous injection of IL-12 intoUVR-exposed wild-type mice significantly reduced thenumber of apoptotic keratinocytes, whereas IL-12 had noeffect in the Xpaknockout mice (Schwarz et al., 2002). Thesefindings indicated that IL-12 might inhibit UVR-inducedapoptosis by reducing UVR-induced DNA damage, whichultimately might be attributed to the induction of NER. Thiswas confirmed by an in vivo study. Upon chronic UVR
exposure, IL-12-deficient mice developed skin tumors at ahigher frequency when compared with wild-type mice(Maeda et al., 2006).For some time, IL-12 has been known to be able toantagonize UVR-induced immunosuppression (Mu ¨lleret al.,1995; Schmitt et al ., 1995; Schwarz et al ., 1996), althoughthe mechanism remains to be elucidated. Currently, this
antagonize UVR-induced immunosuppression (Mu ¨lleret al.,1995; Schmitt et al ., 1995; Schwarz et al ., 1996), althoughthe mechanism remains to be elucidated. Currently, thisactivity also appears to be, at least partially, related to theeffect of IL-12 on DNA repair, as IL-12 prevents both UVR-induced suppression during the induction of contact hyper-sensitivity and the depletion of Langerhans cells in wild-typebut not in DNA repair-deficient mice (Schwarz et al., 2005).Thus, these findings identified a new mechanism by whichIL-12 can protect immune responses and also have shown alink between DNA repair and the prevention of UVR-inducedimmunosuppression by IL-12 (Figure 1).Although the underlying mechanisms are uncertain andremain to be elucidated, the observation that IL-12 influences
NER might have important implications for several reasons.For a long time, it was thought that NER, as an essential repairsystem, is constitutively expressed and not subjected to anyregulation. However, there are indications that NER, incontrast to this previous dogma, can be induced. Eller et al.(1997) first showed that administration of DNA oligonucleo-tides induces DNA repair through a p53-dependent mechan-ism. Accordingly, an in vivo study indicated that topicalpretreatment with DNA oligonucleotides enhanced the rateof DNA photoproduct removal, decreased UVR-inducedmutations, and reduced photocarcinogenesis in UVR-irra-diated mice (Goukassian et al ., 2001). Recently, it wasobserved this might also apply in humans, as treatment ofskin explants obtained from adult human donors withT-oligos significantly reduced CPD upon UVR exposureDNA damageBiologicaleffectDNA repai rCytokineUVRFigure 1 .Crosstalk between DNA damage, DNA repair, and cytokines.
UVR-induced DNA damage is a major molecular trigger for a variety ofbiological UVR effects, including the release of cytokines. By their ability toreduce DNA damage, presumably through the induction of DNA repair,various cytokines may inhibit or reduce some biological effects of UVR.64 Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings (2009), Volume 14T Schwarz and A SchwarzDNA Repair and Cytokines
(Arad et al ., 2006). This effect might have been mediatedthrough p53, which was increased in T-oligo-pretreated skincompared with that in diluent-pretreated skin. The observa-tions with IL-12 add to the concept that the NER can beinduced by external stimuli.The UVR protective effects of extracts from green tea phenolsmay be mediated through IL-12IL-12 might also be involved in the recently described UVRprotective effects of phenol extracts from green tea phenols(GTPs). GTPs protected against UVR-induced erythema,immunosuppression, sunburn cell formation, and skin cancerin animal models (Katiyar et al., 1995). Elmets et al. (2001)showed that GTPs exert similar effects in humans. Whenelucidating the underlying mechanism, Katiyar et al . (1999)
showed that the prevention of UVB-induced immunosup-pression in mice by GTPs may be associated with alterationsin IL-10 and IL-12. Specifically, it was shown that applicationof GTPs before UVB exposure decreased the UVB-inducedproduction of the immunosuppressive cytokine, IL-10,whereas the production of IL-12 was found to be markedlyincreased in the lymph nodes when compared with UVR-only-exposed mice (Katiyar et al., 1999).Follow-up studies indicated that the prevention of UVR-induced immunosuppression by GTPs in mice is mediatedthrough IL-12-dependent DNA repair (Meeran et al., 2006b).Topical application of GTPs prevented UVR-induced sup-pression of contact hypersensitivity in wild-type but not in IL-12-deficient mice. Accordingly, injection of an anti-IL-12antibody blocked the preventive effect of GTPs on UVR-induced immunosuppression. In addition, GTP-inducedreduction of CPD was not observed in IL-12-deficient mice.The link between GTPs and NER was confirmed by the
observation that GTPs did not remove CPD in NER-deficientcells (Meeran et al., 2006a). Furthermore, GTPs were shownto prevent photocarcinogenesis by IL-12-dependent DNArepair. GTPs did not prevent the induction of skin cancer byUVR in IL-12 knockout mice. Accordingly, CPD and sunburncells resolved more rapidly in wild-type mice upon applica-tion of GTPs, but not in IL-12-deficient mice (Meeran et al.,2006a).IL-18 reduces UVR-induced DNA damageThe capacity to reduce UVR-induced DNA damage, andprobably to affect DNA repair, does not appear to be specificto IL-12. The proinflammatory cytokine, IL-18, seems to exertsimilar effects (Schwarz et al., 2006). Injection of IL-18 into
UVR-exposed skin reduced the amount of DNA damage innormal but not in NER-deficient mice, indicating that IL-18like IL-12 reduces DNA damage by DNA repair. UVR-mediated suppression of the induction of contact hypersensi-tivity was prevented upon injection of IL-18 before UVRexposure in wild-type mice but not in NER-deficient mice. Incontrast to IL-12, IL-18 was not able, either in wild-type or inNER-deficient mice, to break UVR-induced immunotoler-ance, which is mediated through regulatory T cells, butindependent of DNA damage (Beissert et al ., 2006). Thisindicates that, although being primarily a proinflammatorycytokine through an effect on DNA damage, IL-18 can alsofoster an immune response that is suppressed by UVR(Figure 2). However, IL-12 is still unique in its capacity torestore immune responses because of its effect on regulatoryT cells.The neuropeptide a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone reducesUVR-induced DNA damageThe neuropeptide, a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone
(a-MSH), was found to block UVR-induced apoptosis bynormal human melanocytes in vitro (Bo¨hmet al., 2005). Theanti-apoptotic activity of a-MSH was not mediated by afiltering effect or by the induction of melanin synthesis inmelanocytes. a-MSH influenced neither the expression of theapoptosis-related proteins (Bcl2, Bcl x, p53, Fas, and FasL)nor the cell cycle. However, a-MSH reduced theamount of UVB-induced DNA damage remarkably asshown by Southwestern blot analysis. The reduction ofUVR-induced DNA damage by a-MSH may also be related
nor the cell cycle. However, a-MSH reduced theamount of UVB-induced DNA damage remarkably asshown by Southwestern blot analysis. The reduction ofUVR-induced DNA damage by a-MSH may also be relatedto NER, as UVR-mediated apoptosis was not blocked bya-MSH in NER-deficient fibroblasts. These data implicate theregulation of UVR-induced apoptosis of human melanocytesby a neuropeptide, which is physiologically expressedwithin the epidermis. Furthermore, this suggests that besidesits ability to induce photoprotective melanin synthesis,a-MSH may exhibit a capacity to reduce UVR-inducedDNA damage. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that throughthis activity a-MSH may act as a protection factor againstthe harmful effects of UVR on the genomic stability ofepidermal cells.IL-12Prevention of UVR-induced immunosuppressionBreaking of UVR-induced immunotoleranceIL-18Prevention of UVR-induced immunosuppressionInduction ofDNA repairImmunostimulatory Proinflammatory
DNA repairImmunostimulatory ProinflammatoryFigure 2 .Effects of IL-12 and IL-18 on UVR-induced immunosuppression.Both IL-12 and IL-18 prevent UVR-induced immunosuppression through themodulation of DNA repair. Accordingly, suppression of the induction ofcontact hypersensitivity by UVR, which is mediated by DNA damage, is notobserved upon injection of either IL-12 or IL-18. In contrast, established UVR-mediated immunotolerance can only be broken by IL-12 but not by IL-18,indicating that IL-12 exerts more pronounced immunostimulatory featuresthan IL-18. Although being primarily a proinflammatory cytokine, IL-18prevents UVR-induced immunosuppression by its capacity to induce DNArepair.

CONCLUSIONUVR-induced DNA damage is regarded as the major triggerfor most of the biological effects of UVR. Consequently, thissignal transduction pathway was supposed to be unidirec-tional, as any biological effect should be the consequence ofDNA damage. The observation that several cytokines can, inturn, control DNA repair and consequently UVR-inducedDNA damage suggests that this signaling pathway may not beas unidirectional as initially anticipated, but indicates theexistence of a biofeedback mechanism (Figure 1). Thiscrosstalk may represent a new defense mechanism of thehost against UVR-induced immunosuppression and of carci-nogenesis. Future studies will clarify whether this observationis of practical relevance in the development of sun protectionstrategies.CONFLICT OF INTERESTTS is a member of the advisory board of AGI-Dermatics.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe studies described herein were supported by grants from the
