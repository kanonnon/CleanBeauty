KEY WORDS : -  Hair care, Natural, Herbal formulation, Medicinal plant, Alopecia.  INTRODUCTION  Hair is one of the vital parts of the body derived from ectoderm of the skin, is protective appendages on t he body and considered accessory structure of the integumen t along with sebaceous glands, sweat glands and nails (1). They are also known as epidermal derivatives as they origina te from the epidermis during embryological development. Hai r is an
important of the overall appeal of the human body ( 2-4).  Alopecia is a dermatological disorder that has been  recognized for more than 2000 years. It is a synony m of baldness, involves absence or loss of hair, especia lly of the head (5). It is common throughout the world and has  been estimated to affect between 0.2% and 2% of the worl d population. Alopecia has also been observed as majo r side effect of anticancer drugs, immunosuppressant and m any other drug treatments. Mental shock, emotional stra in, focal infection, errors of refraction, endocrine disturba nce, neuro-circulation instability and genetic predisposition are also the known cause of alopecia (6). Ayurveda has described  hair disease in three words, which are as under (7-8). Khalitya    : Means loss of hairs Palitya      : Means prematured hair graying Indralupta :Mean alopecia areata, totalis, universa lis The search for treatment results into few drugs of synthetic
origin, but side effects associated with them can n ot be neglected. Herbal drugs or their formulation are vi able alternative to synthetic drugs. Natural remedies ha ve been used for centuries for treating alopecia (9-11). In  traditional Indian system of medicine many plants and herbal formulations are reported for hair growth promotion  as well as improvement of quality of hairs (12). About 100 hair growth products are available in the markets which are prepared by combination of one or more herbal drugs  (13). Some of hair growth products available in the marke t are listed in table 1. Although they are currently wide ly accepted by the patient, their scientific respect among derm atologists in particular is limited. The alternative medicines  seem promising, although their true effects are unknown so further  investigation must be performed. Recently, various p lant extract have been patented for use in hair growth o r hair
tonic products, and for prevention of alopecia. The  patents claim that the effect are due to stimulation of the  hair follicle or scalp metabolism, possibility due to an  acceleration
tonic products, and for prevention of alopecia. The  patents claim that the effect are due to stimulation of the  hair follicle or scalp metabolism, possibility due to an  acceleration of blood circulation, activation of dermal papilla,  antitestosterone action or increased nutrition to t he hair follicles through accelerated blood flow but the me chanism are not yet clear(14-15). The article present a rev iew of those used more frequently.    Hibscus rosa-sinesis  Linn. (Malvaceae) is a glabrous shrub widely cultivated in the tropics. It is well accept ed that the leaves and flowers of Hibiscus rosa-sinesis  have hair growth promoting and antigreying properties (16-17). Moreo ver in India, the herbal products in the market intended f or hair growth include the extract of various parts of Hibiscus rosa-sinesis . Adhirajan et al . reported that the leaf extract of Hibscus rosa-sinesis  has a potential effect on maintaining the
hair growth in in-vivo  and in-vitro  methods(18). Tridax procumbens  L. (Compositae) is a weed found throughout India. The plant is known to local peopl e as “Ghamara” and is dispensed for “Bhringraj” by some of the practitioners of Ayurveda (19). Pathak et al . investigated hair growth promoting activity of Tridax procumbens and concluded that ethanolic extract of Tridax procumbe ns promotes the growth of hair. Therefore the dispensi ng of this plant by some practitioners of Ayurveda for “Bhring raj” is justifiable (20).   Cuscuta reflexa  Roxb.(Convolvulaceae) is a leafless, twinning, parasitic dodder with slender long yellow stems dis tributed in tropical and temperate region and common throughout  India. It is commonly known as amarbel. Dixit et al . reported hair growth activity of Cuccuta reflexa  Roxb. stem through the periodic transformation of hair follicle from telog en to anagen phase. However, the exact mechanism of hair growth
stimulation is not known and further studies are a perquisite in order to evaluate the exact mechanism behind hai r growth

Rho et al . suggested that the Asiasari radix extract has hair growth pro moting potential, and this effect may be due to its regula tory effects on both cell growth and growth factor gene expressi on (22).  Roh et al . found that the extract of dried roots of Sophora flavescens  has out standing hair growth promoting effect. Sophora flavescens  extract induced mRNA levels of growth factors such as IGF-1 and KGF in dermal papilla cel ls, suggesting that the effect of Sophora flavescens  extract on hair growth may be mediated through the regulation of growth factors in dermal papilla cells. In addition  the Sophora
flavescens  extract revealed to possess potent inhibitory effe ct on the type II 5α-reductase activity (23). Ocimum gratissum  Linn. (Lamiaceae) is an herb found throughout India. Orafidiya et al . investigated the efficacy of the leaf essential oil of Ocimum gratissum  Linn. (Ocimum oil) in promoting hair growth in cyclophosphamide-induce d hair loss and concluded that ocimum oil may be capable o f enhanced normal hair growth and promoting follicula r proliferation in cyclophosphamide-induced hair loss  (24). Lygodii spora (spore of Lygodium joponicum  T., Schizaeaceae) is a Chinese medicinal herb found in china. Matsuda  et al . investigated the hair growth activity of Lygodii sp ora. From the lipophilic constituent of lygodii spora, oleic,  linoleic and palmitic acids were identified as the main active p rinciple inhibiting testosterone 5 alpha-reductase (25). Ginseng radix is the steamed and dried root of Panax ginseng .
It is an important crude drug that has been used fr om ancient time to improve constitutional tendencies to poor b ody condition, to promote appetite, to increase vitalit y and to reduce over sensitivity to cold. Matsuda et al.  indicated that Ginseng radix possesses hair growth promoting activ ity and that G-Rb 1, may be one of the active constituents of ginseng radix in the mouse vibrissal hair follicle organ cu lture model (26).   Procyanidin B-2 is a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibit ors, a compound identified in apple ( Malus pumila ) act as a growth-promoting factor on murine hair epithelial celll. K amimura et al  suggested that procyanidin B-2, a compound that po ssesses hair-growing activity, causes modulation of the exp ression and translocation of PKC isozymes (α, βI, βII and η) in hair epithelial cells (27). Proanthocyanidins are a species of phenolic compoun d that take the form of polymers or oligomers built of fla van-3-ol
unit. Takahasi et al  reported that proanthocyanidins extracted from grape seeds promote proliferation of  hair follicle cells in-vitro  and they possess remarkable hair cycle
unit. Takahasi et al  reported that proanthocyanidins extracted from grape seeds promote proliferation of  hair follicle cells in-vitro  and they possess remarkable hair cycle converting activity from the telogen phase to the a nagen phase in-vivo . Kobayashi et al . investigated that Ginkgo biloba  leaf extract promote hair regrowth, through combined effects on proliferation and apoptosis of the cells in the hai r follicule, thus suggesting potential as a hair tonic (29). Aloe vera  L. or A. barbadensis  gel is used traditionally for hair loss and for improvement in hair growth following a lopecia. Inaoka et al . reported that aloenin is the major constituent responsible for promoting hair growth without irrit ating the skin. Aloe vera  has been cited as treatment for brittle hair, but with no evidence to substantiate this claim (30 ). Rosemary or Rosmarinus officinalis  Linn. (Labiatae) is an aromatic herb surrounded by tradition and legends b ut with
improvement culinary, medicinal and cosmetic proper ties. In folk medicine it is used to stimulate growth of hai r as a rinse. The most important constituents of rosemary are tho ught to be caffeic acid it’s derivatives such as rosmarinic  acid; these compounds have antioxidant effect (32) Henna or Lawsonia alba  L. (Lythraceae) has been cited as a growth accelerator and was used in an ancient Egypt ian formula to cure the loss of hair. The incidence of contact dermatitis appears to be extremely rare with the us e of henna, since henna leaf extract have mild anti-infl ammatory and antiallergic effect (33)

An official Publication of Phcog.Net  The leave and the fruits of Thujae occidentalis  have been known as an oriental herbal medicine for the treatm ent of renopathy, leukotrichia and alopecia. Park et al  demonstrated the inhibitory activity of Thujae occidentalis  semen extract for 5α-reductase type 2 and its biolo gical action in two animal models, suggesting that TOS ex tract would be used as an effective agent for male patter n baldness by modifying androgen conversion. (34) The herb T. procumbens  and E. alba  belongs to the compositae family, found as weed throughout India a nd used in the indigenous system of medicine for the treatm ent of variety of human ailments, particularly liver disor ders, wound healing and as hair growth promoters. The herb C.Colocynthis
from Cucurbitaceae family is a native of warmer par t of Asia and Africa, occur wild throughout India. The fruits  and roots of the plant were mainly used as purgative and blac kening of hair. Dixit et al.  investigated hair growth activity of a mixture of Eclipta alba  hassk, Citrullus colocynthis  shrad and Tridax procumbens  Linn (35). Jain et al . investigated the hair growth activity of almond o il, til oil and coconut oil preparation containing arie l part of Zizyphus jusaba , Cuscuta reflexa , Citrus burgamia , Lagenaria sicararia , Hibiscus rosasinesis  and Allieum cepa,  seed of Trigonella foinum  graceum fruits of Embelica officinalis  (36). CONCLUSION  Alopecia is common problem that has affected men an d women for years. It is still not fully understood a nd continues to be investigated through many treatment are on of fered including natural or synthetic based products, but natural product are continuously gaining popularly and the use of
plant extract in formulation is in rise. Because sy nthetic based product may cause human health hazard with se veral side effects. Looking at the increasing popularity of the herbal drugs in hair care, it should be worthwhile to take up systemic investigation on the efficacy of these dru gs and their preparation. In the future it is possible that many  new plants extract of commercial significance will be identifi ed and claims of many wide spread herbs will be proven. REFERENCES 1.  F.I.G. Ebling.
