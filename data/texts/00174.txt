Introduction
1. IntroductionMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have generated enormous interest in the ﬁeld of regenerativemedicine due to their ability to undergo multilineage di ﬀerentiation, their favorable characteristics forculture and manipulation in vitro , and their strong immunomodulatory activity [ 1]. MSCs regulateT and B cells through the production of immunosuppressive molecules, including indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), transforming growth factor(TGF)- β, haem oxygenase 1 (HO1), leukemia inhibitory factor, programmed death-ligand 1, hepatocytegrowth factor (HGF), and galectins [ 2–10]. Recent studies suggest that the therapeutic e ﬀects of MSCs,especially those that are immunomodulatory, can be largely attributed to paracrine e ﬀectors [ 11].These studies showed that MSCs do not engraft and replace damaged tissues directly. Instead, the
paracrine e ﬀectors secreted by these cells exert therapeutic e ﬀects. Among such e ﬀectors, exosomesare considered key [ 11], having strong anti-inﬂammatory potential [ 12]. Here, we will summarizeimportant points about the characteristics, isolation, and therapeutic applications of MSC-derivedexosomes, as well as methods to increase their therapeutic potential through pre-conditioning ofMSC cultures. Finally, we will provide a perspective on the future of MSC-derived exosomes intranslational medicine.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 727; doi:10.3390 /ijms21030727 www.mdpi.com /journal /ijms
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 727 2 of 222. Exosome Biology2.1. Exosome BiogenesisCells secrete various types of extracellular vesicles (EVs). First discovered in 1967 by PeterWolf, they were originally named “platelet dust” [ 13]. EVs are now categorized according to theirdiameter: apoptotic bodies, >1000 nm; microvesicles, 100–1000 nm; and exosomes, 30–150 nm [ 14]. Theoverlapping size of exosomes and microvesicles can be distinguished by their distinctive biogenesispathways [ 15]. Exosomes are found in various physiological ﬂuids, such as blood, saliva, urine,amniotic ﬂuid, milk, and so on [ 16]. Exosome biogenesis occurs in early endosomes via the inwardbudding of the endosomal membrane to form intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), generating multivesicularbodies (MVBs) (Figure 1). Although endosome-dependent pathway is considered as a main biogenesisof exosomes, some studies suggest that direct budding of the plasma membrane also accounts for
a signiﬁcant portion of exosome biogenesis [ 17] (Figure 1). Upon fusion of MVBs with the plasmamembrane, the ILVs are secreted extracellularly as exosomes. Several Rab GTPases (RAB11, RAB35,RAB27a, and RAB27b) mediate the fusion process [ 18]. The secreted exosomes are then taken up byrecipient cells. Exosomes can be endocytosed or interact with recipient cells by ligand-receptor bindingor direct binding [19].Figure 1. Exosome biogenesis and its application. ( A) Exosome biogenesis.

( ) Diagnosis: Exosomes derived from patients can be used for diseasediagnosis. ( ) Therapy: Exosomes derived from MSCs can be used to treat several diseases.The Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) machinery functions topromote the budding and release of ILVs into the endosomal lumen, and thus exosome biogenesis(Figure 1). Each ESCRT complex consists of multiple proteins. ESCRT 0 recognizes and sequestersubiquitinated proteins in the endosomal membrane, and recruits ESCRT I and II. Ubiquitin (Ub) isknown as a signal molecule that sends membrane proteins or damaged cellular components to the
lysosome for degradation [ 20]. It also acts as a signal for exosomal cargo sorting on the endosome
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 727 3 of 22membrane. MVB can either fuse with lysosomes for degradation or fuse with the plasma membrane torelease exosomes [ 21]. Then, ESCRT I and II initiate intraluminal membrane budding by binding to theouter surface of the endosomal membrane near the ubiquitinated protein cargos, thereby selectingthem to be in the newly-forming intraluminal buds in the MVB and serving an important role in cargosorting. ESCRT III completes the process by sequestrating MVB proteins. After ILVs are generated,ESCRT III is separated from the MVB membrane by the sorting protein VPS4.However, it has been reported that blocking the ESCRT pathway does not inhibit MVB formation,suggesting the possibility of an ESCRT-independent pathway (Figure 1) [ 22]. As one example of analternative mechanism, the syndecans (SDC1-4), which are ubiquitous transmembrane proteins, directlyregulate the ILVs during exosome formation by co-accumulating with syntenin and ALIX in exosomes.
In this syndecan-syntenin-ALIX pathway, heparinase, ADP ribosylation factor 6, syndecan heparansulfate proteoglycans, phospholipase D2, and syntenin mediate exosome budding [ 18]. There are othermechanisms in exosome biogenesis, indicated by the ﬁnding that sphingolipid ceramide is requiredfor ILV formation. Neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase) facilitates ILV formation by promoting MVBbudding. In this pathway, exosomes are enriched with proteolipoprotein, CD63, CD81, and TSG101.2.2. Isolation Methods for ExosomesThe conventional exosome isolation method is di ﬀerential ultracentrifugation, which separatesexosomes by density and size [ 23]. This method is easy, cost-e ﬀective, and advantageous when isolatingexosomes from large volumes of biological ﬂuids. However, this method lacks speciﬁcity, so theexosomes could be contaminated with other extracellular vesicles with similar diameters. To increase
the purity of isolated exosomes, di ﬀerential ultracentrifugation is used in conjunction with iodixanolor sucrose cushions [ 24,25]. Exosomes can also be isolated by ﬁltration [ 26]. After cell debris and largemolecules are removed, the ﬁltrate can be ultraﬁltered to eliminate small contaminants. Filtrationmethods can reduce the time and e ﬀort needed for isolation. However, because exosomes are isolatedbased on the pore size of the ﬁlter, it is hard to separate exosomes from contaminants like apoptoticbodies, or microbubbles that have similar diameters [27].Immunoa ﬃnity chromatography can be used to increase the purity of isolated exosomes. Inthis approach, antibodies in the column capture exosomes by binding to speciﬁc surface ligands ofexosomes [ 28]. However, because only small sample volumes can be loaded at once, immunoa ﬃnitychromatography is inappropriate for purifying exosomes from large sample volumes. Like the ﬁltration
method, size exclusion chromatography isolates exosomes by size [ 29], but uses beads that have poreswithin which exosomes can be captured. Large particles that cannot be captured by the beads passthrough the column. Precipitation can be used to concentrate isolated exosomes. However, becausechemical treatments can damage exosomes, or co-precipitate other molecules, precipitated exosomescannot be used for further functional applications [ 30]. Although each isolation method has its own prosand cons, their limitations can be moderated in part by using the methods combinatorially, improvingboth yield and purity. Table 1 provides a summary and comparison of exosome isolation methods.

Exosome Components and FunctionBecause they form by budding from early endosomes, exosomes are encapsulated by a lipidbilayer membrane. Exosome membranes contain large amounts of cholesterol, sphingomyelin, andceramide, which are present in lipid rafts [ 31]. Some studies suggest that certain lipid components, suchas phosphatidylserine and prostaglandins, may play an important role in exosome function [ 32,33].ExoCarta, an exosome database contains 41,860 protein, 1116 lipid molecule, 3408 mRNA, 2838 miRNAentries, derived from studies of exosomes in several species [ 34]. EVpedia, another data repository site,contains information about 92,897 proteins, 27,642 mRNAs, 4934 miRNAs, and 584 lipids, derived
from 538 reports covering 33 species [ 35]. The most common proteins are members of the tetraspaninfamily, a group of sca ﬀolding membrane proteins that include CD63, CD81, and CD9; they localizeat the exosome surface and serve as markers [ 36]. Other common proteins found in these databasesinclude membrane transporters and fusion proteins such as GTPases, annexins, and ﬂotillin, heat shockproteins such as HSP70, MVB biogenesis proteins such as Alix and TSG101, lipid-related proteins, andphospholipases [ 37,38]. Exosomes also contain mRNAs and miRNAs. When exosomes are endocytosedby recipient cells, the genetic information carried by the RNAs can a ﬀect protein expression in thosecells [39,40].Depending on their speciﬁc characteristics, exosomes can be used in disease diagnosis, fordrug delivery, and as therapeutic agents (Figure 1) [ 41]. Because exosomes contain unique bioactive
molecules representing the components, physiological status, and character of the original cell [ 42],they have been referred to as the “ﬁngerprint” of the parent cell [ 43]. For example, MHC II is found inEVs secreted by antigen presenting cells [ 44,45]. Also, several studies have conﬁrmed that exosomesproduced by cancer cells contain miRNAs that are identical to those in the original cancer cells. Inaddition, exosomes have a structure similar to that of liposomes and therefore their cargos are protectedfrom the external environment, maintaining the integrity of cargo information. Moreover, becauseexosomes are found in body ﬂuids, they can be isolated from patients in a non-invasive manner [ 46].Altogether, these features support the idea that exosomes could be used as diagnostic biomarkers forcancer and neurodegenerative, metabolic, and infectious diseases, useful for deﬁning the patient’s
state of health [ 47] and helping clinicians make reliable diagnoses. It is of course important thatthe correlation between the disease and the biomarker be carefully conﬁrmed. Other features ofexosomes make them an attractive potential drug delivery tool [ 48]. Exosomes have the ability to
the correlation between the disease and the biomarker be carefully conﬁrmed. Other features ofexosomes make them an attractive potential drug delivery tool [ 48]. Exosomes have the ability tomediate intercellular communication between widely separated locations in the body [ 49], movingthroughout the body via the blood, and avoid inducing immune responses. Of great interest for drug
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 727 5 of 22delivery, exosomes can penetrate the blood-brain barrier [ 50,51]. Moreover, during migration, RNAscarried by exosomes are resistant to degradation by RNase activity. Finally, exosomes can be used asan alternative to cell therapy. Compared to therapies involving the injection of live cells that couldcause uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation, exosomes are safer and easier to control [ 52]. Incontrast to cells, exosomes do not become mutated, do not duplicate, and cannot induce metastasis. Inthis review, we will focus on the therapeutic applications of MSC-derived exosomes and will describeit in detail below.3. Therapeutic Applications of MSC-Derived ExosomesAdministration of MSC-derived exosomes has been shown to ameliorate disease phenotypes in avariety of disease models. For example, Teng et al. reported that in a rat myocardial infarction (MI)
model, MSC-derived exosomes signiﬁcantly improved tube formation by endothelial cells, impairedT cell functions, reduced infarct size, and preserved cardiac systolic and diastolic performance [ 53].Furthermore, exosomes enriched with microRNA (miR)-11 by ischemic pre-conditioning were shownto signiﬁcantly reduce infarct size and cardiac ﬁbrosis by targeting methyl CpG binding protein 2in a mouse post-myocardial infarction model [ 54]. Zhou et al. showed that exosomes from humanumbilical cord-derived MSCs signiﬁcantly reduced levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine,necrosis of proximal kidney tubules, and formation of abundant tubular protein casts by anti-oxidationand anti-apoptosis mechanisms in a cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury model [ 55]. In the lung,MSC-derived exosomes relieved hyperoxia-associated inﬂammation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia,pulmonary hypertension, ﬁbrosis, and pulmonary vascular remodeling by modulating the lung
macrophage phenotype in a preclinical model [ 56]. Therapeutic e ﬀects of exosomes in allergicconditions and wound healing processes have also been reported. Cho et al. showed that exosomesfrom human adipose tissue-derived MSCs reduced levels of lgE, eosinophils, inﬁltrated mast cells, andCD86+and CD206+cells in a mouse model of atopic dermatitis [ 57]. Umbilical cord MSC-derivedexosomes prevented scar tissue formation and reduced myoﬁbroblast accumulation by inhibiting theTGF- β/SMAD2 pathway in a skin-defect mouse model [ 58]. Umbilical cord MSC-derived exosomes alsoaccelerated re-epithelialization with increased expression of CK19, PCNA, and collagen I in vivo [59].In muscle tissue, MSC-derived exosomes enhanced regeneration by promoting myogenesis andangiogenesis; miR-494 is involved in this muscle regeneration process [ 60]. In work related toautoimmune conditions, Riazifar et al. demonstrated that MSC-derived exosomes reduced levels of
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and promoted the induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in an experimentalautoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis [61].Exosome treatment may also represent a new strategy for treating neural injuries andneurodegenerative diseases [ 62]. Exosomes enhanced functional recovery and increased neuroplasticityin young adult rats in which traumatic brain injury (TBI) had been induced [ 63]. In anotherTBI-related study, exosomes from bone marrow-derived MSCs diminished the lesion size, improvedneurobehavioral performance, and exhibited neuroprotective e ﬀects by inhibiting the expressionof pro-apoptosis protein Bcl-2-associated X protein, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- α, and interleukin(IL)-1 β, enhancing the expression of anti-apoptosis protein B-cell lymphoma 2, and regulatingmicroglia /macrophage polarization [ 64]. In spinal cord injury-related studies, exosomes promoted
angiogenesis, hindlimb locomotor activity, tissue sparing, reduced lesion size, endothelial cellproliferation, and attenuated inﬂammation and cellular apoptosis [ 65]. Exosomes regulated the
angiogenesis, hindlimb locomotor activity, tissue sparing, reduced lesion size, endothelial cellproliferation, and attenuated inﬂammation and cellular apoptosis [ 65]. Exosomes regulated theactions of macrophages [ 66], and decreased neurotoxic A1 astrocytes activation via restraining nucleartranslocation of NF KB p65 resulting in neuroprotection [ 67]. Ruppert et al. also reported similarresults, which conﬁrmed that MSC-derived EVs reduced inﬂammation with disorganized astrocytesand microglia in cord tissue resulting in improved locomotor activity [ 68]. Stroke is another complexdisease that is a leading cause of death and disability. Emerging data show that exosomes exhibitneuroprotective e ﬀects after stroke, increasing nerve regeneration and neurological recovery andregulating peripheral immune responses; neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and axonal plasticity are
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 727 6 of 22improved [ 69]. In a study related to Alzheimer’s disease, the most prevalent neurodegenerativedisease, MSC-derived exosomes stimulated neurogenesis and moderated beta amyloid (1–42)-inducedcognitive impairment in mice [ 70]. Hypoxia-pre-conditioned MSC-derived exosomes amelioratedcognitive decline by rescuing synaptic dysfunction and regulating inﬂammatory responses in APP /PS1mice, a model of Alzheimer’s disease [ 71]. These results suggest that treatment with MSC-derivedexosomes could improve disease phenotypes in human patients with neurodegenerative conditions.Current clinical trials of exosomes are summarized in Table 2 (clinicaltrial.gov).Table 2.

Pre-Conditioning Approaches to Enhance the Therapeutic E ﬃcacy of ExosomesAs described above, MSC-derived exosomes exert therapeutic e ﬀects in various disease models.Because exosome characteristics vary depending on the status of the MSCs from which they are derived,and because the MSC status changes in response to external stimuli, several studies have investigatedwhether pre-conditioning MSCs can enhance the therapeutic activities of exosomes. Pre-conditioningof MSCs with cytokines, hypoxia, and chemicals has been shown to improve their immunosuppressive,immunomodulatory, and regenerative e ﬀects [73].Moreover, gene and cell surface modiﬁcation of MSCs can enhance their therapeutic e ﬃcacy [ 74].Pre-conditioning approaches that increase exosome activity directly, or indirectly by increasing MSC
function, can both be utilized to maximize the therapeutic potential of MSC-derived exosomes (Figure 2).

Pre-Conditioning of MSCs: Increasing Exosome ProductionIncreasing the production of exosomes from MSCs is an urgent unmet medical need. Therefore,pre-conditioning approaches that increase exosome production are essential. One report showedthat 3-D culture techniques had desirable e ﬀects. MSCs are usually cultured on 2-D surfaces inplastic plates, which lack conditions found in the MSC physiological niche. Use of a 3-D porousscaﬀold structure instead increased the production of exosomes from MSCs; furthermore, the exosomes
had improved therapeutic e ﬀects in a rat brain disease model [ 75]. Large-scale MSC expansions bybioreactors and microcarriers can be utilized for increasing the production of exosomes [ 76]. Anotherapproach indicated that vesiculation bu ﬀers containing chloride salts increased the production ofEVs from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by osmotic stress [ 77]. Usage of 1- to 2- µm porepolymer ﬁlters improved the production of exosomes by extruding cells [ 78]. The production ofEVs were also increased by treating cytochalasin B [ 79]. Interestingly, transplantation of exosomesfrom cytochalasin B-treated-MSCs showed angiogenic activities as in transplantation of MSCs [ 80].Pre-conditioning using chemicals that stimulate the factors involved in exosome biogenesis may bean attractive approach. One study found that antifungal reagents increased exosome productionin prostate cancer cells [ 81]. In this case, the modiﬁed imidazole, nitrefazole (20 µm), signiﬁcantly
increased exosome production from the C4-2B cell line. Nitrefazole increased the level of Rab27a, aprotein that regulates MVB exocytosis. Treatment with nitrefazole and another azole, pentetrazole,signiﬁcantly increased the levels of the exosome biogenesis-related molecules Alix and nSMase2. Suchtreatment also increased the p-ERK level. These data indicate that an azole might be a candidate forincreasing exosome production from MSCs by modulating exosome biogenesis and release [ 81]. Geneediting might be another e ﬀective way to increase exosome production from MSCs. Various genesinvolved in exosome biogenesis and secretion could be modiﬁed to either overexpress the encodedproteins or knock out their functions [ 82]. For example, overexpression of phospholipase D2 led to atwo-fold increase in the number of exosomes [ 83]. Tables 3 and 4 summarize information about smallmolecules and gene modiﬁcations, respectively, that have been shown to increase exosome production.
Although the targets have been tested in cancer cell lines, it would be worthwhile to test the e ﬀects ofthese modiﬁcations on exosome production in MSCs as well.

Pre-Conditioning of MSCs with CytokinesRecent studies revealed that pro-inﬂammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN)- γ, TNF- α, IL-1 β,IL-6, and TGF- βeﬀectively enhance the therapeutic functions of MSCs. Pre-conditioning of MSCs withIFN- γstimulates the cells (referred to as IFN- γ-primed MSCs), which produce exosomes enrichedin anti-inﬂammatory proteins, neuroprotective proteins, and anti-inﬂammatory RNAs [ 61,100,101].Exosomes derived from IFN- γ-primed MSCs relieved several symptoms of multiple sclerosis in anEAE mouse model. When activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured withexosomes from IFN- γ-primed MSCs, PBMC proliferation and the level of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
(IL-6, IL-22) decreased. In contrast, the level of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IDO increased [ 61].Another study tested EVs from IFN- γ-primed MSCs. When cultured with EVs from IFN- γ-primedMSCs, the phagocytic and bacterial killing activity of a THP-1 cell line was enhanced. Furthermore,EVs from IFN- γ-primed MSCs attenuate Escherichia coli -induced lung injury in an E. coli -inducedpneumonia mouse model [ 102]. A recent study demonstrated that pre-conditioning of MSCs withTNF- α(TNF- α-primed MSCs) produced exosomes containing miR-146a, which inhibit activationof ﬁbroblast and inﬂammatory responses in an urethral ﬁbrosis mouse model, demonstrating theanti-inﬂammatory e ﬀects of miR-146a [ 103]. Additionally, exosomes from TNF- α-primed MSCs werefound to improve the proliferation and di ﬀerentiation of primary human osteoblasts by increasing theexpression of Wnt-3a in vitro [104]. The e ﬀects of pre-conditioning of MSCs with IL-1 β(IL-1 β-primed
MSCs) in vitro and in vivo have also been reported. Song et al. investigated the therapeutic e ﬀects ofIL-1β-primed MSCs and the exosomes produced by these cells in a mouse model of sepsis and foundthat the cells increased the survival rate of this model. Furthermore, IL-1 β-primed MSCs showedupregulated expression of anti-inﬂammatory miR-146a; exosomes from these cells also containedmiR-146a, which was transferred to macrophages and induced M2 polarization [ 105]. Wang andcoworkers demonstrated that pre-conditioning of MSCs with TGF- β(TGF- β-primed MSCs) increasedthe expression of miR-135b in exosomes, which promoted chondrocyte proliferation in vitro throughSp1 regulation and cartilage tissue repair in an osteoarthritis rat model [106].
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 727 9 of 22Several studies have investigated the use of a combination of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines forMSC pre-conditioning. EVs from IFN- γ- and TNF- α-primed MSCs showed di ﬀerent protein, miRNA,and cytokine proﬁles compared to EVs from naïve MSCs. Culturing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducedrat splenocytes with EVs from IFN- γ- and TNF- α-primed MSCs markedly reduces the levels ofpro-inﬂammatory cytokines (IFN- γ, TNF- α) in the splenocytes in vitro , an e ﬀect that is due to increasedlevels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and cyclooxygenase 2 [ 101]. Another study showed that expressionof several immunosuppressive factors (IDO, PGE2, IL-8, IL-6, CCL-2) was increased in IFN- γ- andTNF- α-primed MSCs. Moreover, exosomes from the primed MSCs showed increased levels of miR-34aand miR-146a, which are potential anti-inﬂammatory factors, skewing macrophage di ﬀerentiation
toward the M2 phenotype [ 100]. Another study showed that exosomes from IFN- γ- and TGF- β-primedMSCs promote mononuclear cell transformation into Tregs in vitro [106].4.3. Pre-Conditioning of MSCs with HypoxiaHypoxia conditioning is a widely used approach for priming MSCs and MSC-derived exosomes.Several studies have demonstrated that exosomes from MSCs pre-conditioned with hypoxia(hypoxia-primed MSCs) promote angiogenesis relative to exosomes from MSCs cultured undernormoxic conditions. In 2012, Zhang et al. reported that microvesicles from hypoxia-primed humanumbilical cord (UC) MSCs promoted UC-endothelial cell (UC-EC) proliferation in vitro and alsoimproved blood ﬂow recovery in a hindlimb ischemia rat model [ 107]. Salomon et al. investigatedthe eﬀects of exosomes from hypoxia-primed placental MSCs. These exosomes increased migrationand promoted tube formation by placental microvascular endothelial cells [ 108]. Exosomes from
hypoxia-primed MSCs increased migration and capillary network formation by human umbilical veinECs (HUVECs) in vitro . In addition, exosomes from hypoxia-primed MSCs attenuated inﬂammationafter fat grafting, increased fat survival [ 109]. Co-transplantation of exosomes with a fat graft resulted inincreased expression of EGF, ﬁbroblast growth factor, angiopoietin-1, and angiopoietin receptor (Tie-1)proteins [ 110]. It was observed that exosomes from hypoxia-primed MSCs versus MSCs cultured undernormoxic conditions were more easily taken up by HUVECs; the uptaken exosomes promoted vascularendothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and protein kinase A signaling pathway activation, whichresulted in improved angiogenesis by HUVECs [ 111,112]. Exosomes from hypoxia-primed MSCs havealso been shown to promote myocardial repair. One study found that exosomes transferred miR-210to HUVECs in an nSMase2-dependent manner, resulting in improved angiogenic and anti-apoptotic
functions of HUVECs in vitro and cardioprotection (improved vascularization and survival rate) in anMI mouse model [ 113]. Exosomes from hypoxia-primed MSCs also contain miR-125b, which impedescell death in the MI mouse model [ 113]; another study suggested that the exosomes directly suppressGSK3 βexpression through miRNA-26a, resulting in cardioprotective e ﬀects in an MI rat model [ 114].Exosomes from hypoxia-primed MSCs can also promote regeneration, alter immune responses,and exert neuroprotective e ﬀects. For example, medium from adipose-derived, hypoxia-primed MSCscontains more cytokines (IL-6, TNF- α) and growth factors (HGF, VEGF) and promotes AML12 cellproliferation compared to normoxic condition through JAK /STAT3 signaling in vitro [115]. Furthermore,microvesicles derived from hypoxia-primed MSCs were found to promote cell proliferation andmigration of U2OS cells in vitro , partially through the PI3K /AKT and HIF-1 αpathway [ 116]. Exosomes
from hypoxia-primed MSCs also have immunomodulatory functions [ 117]. In an endotoxin-induced
migration of U2OS cells in vitro , partially through the PI3K /AKT and HIF-1 αpathway [ 116]. Exosomesfrom hypoxia-primed MSCs also have immunomodulatory functions [ 117]. In an endotoxin-inducedacute lung injury (ALI) mouse model, exosomes from hypoxia-primed MSCs reduced the level of whiteblood cells and neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) ﬂuid. Levels of MIP-2 (also knownas CXCL2) and osmotic protein in BAL also deceased [ 96]. It has been reported that hypoxia-primedMSCs go through glycolytic reprogramming, which results in the production of anti-inﬂammatoryexosomes and is related to M2 macrophage polarization and Treg induction [ 118]. Another studysuggested that M2 polarization is partially mediated by miR-21-5p contained in exosomes [ 119]. Finally,in an APP /PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, exosomes from hypoxia-primed MSCs decreasedamyloid plaque deposition and the beta amyloid level, and upregulated the expression of synaptic
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 727 10 of 22proteins such as growth-associated protein 43 and synapsin 1 [ 71]. Exosomes from hypoxia-primedMSCs inhibited astrocyte and microglia activation and promoted the transformation of microglia todendritic cells, resulting in a neuroprotective e ﬀectin vivo . Moreover, the exosomes decreased theexpression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (TNF- α, IL-1 β) and increased that of anti-inﬂammatorycytokines (IL-4, IL-10).4.4. Pre-Conditioning of MSCs with Biomolecules or ChemicalsSome studies have compared the e ﬀects of exosomes from MSCs pre-conditioned with LPS(LPS-primed MSCs) with exosomes from unconditioned MSCs. The secretome of such MSCs has beenshown to improve liver regeneration by decreasing serum IL-6 and TNF- αlevels in vivo [120]. Otherstudies revealed that exosomes from LPS-primed MSCs induced THP-1 to increase production ofanti-inﬂammatory cytokines and promote M2 polarization [ 121]. The miRNA let-7b, which is involved
in monocyte activation and di ﬀerentiation, is present at especially high levels in these exosomes. A recentstudy has also shown that culturing macrophages with exosomes from LPS-primed MSCs increasesSTAT3 gene expression, secretion of cytokines (IL-10 and IL-15), and expression of growth factors(FLT-3L); such macrophages also extend survival in a mouse model of acute radiation syndrome [ 122]. Adiﬀerent study showed that exosomes from LPS-primed MSCs increased M2 macrophage polarization,resulting in the attenuation of post-infarction inﬂammation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a mousemodel of MI [123].A variety of other molecules have been tested as pre-conditioning agents. Recent studieshave examined the e ﬀects of thrombin. Exosomes from MSCs pre-conditioned with thrombin(thrombin-primed MSCs) improved proliferation, migration, and tube formation by HUVECs in vitroand cutaneous wound healing in vivo [124]. In another study, exosomes from thrombin-primed MSCs
from Wharton’s Jelly showed enhanced anti-inﬂammatory and anti-apoptotic e ﬀects, resulting inattenuation of brain infarction in a rat model of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy [ 124]. Exosomesfrom MSCs pre-conditioned with melatonin decreased the expression of HIF1α,ICAM1 ,IL1B andNFkB ,and increased the expression of BCL2 ,HO1 ,IL10 andVEGF in a rat model of renal ischemia-reperfusioninjury [ 125], whereas exosomes from MSCs pre-conditioned with advanced glycation end productscontained a high level of miR-146a and inhibited calciﬁcation of vascular smooth muscle cellsin vitro [126]. One study reported that pre-conditioning MSCs with deferoxamine increased theexpression of miR-126a; exosomes derived from these cells promoted angiogenesis by HUVECs andpromoted cutaneous wound healing in a diabetic rat model [ 127]. Interestingly, treating MSCs withSuxiao Jiuxin pill (a traditional Chinese medicine used in acute coronary syndrome) enhanced the
function of derived exosomes, which increased the proliferation of cardiomyocytes by decreasing theexpression of the H3K27 demethylase UTX [ 128]. Exosomes from MSCs pre-conditioned with NOcontained an increased level of VEGF and miR-126, and promoted angiogenesis by HUVECs [ 129]. Inanother study using sodium nitroprusside (SNP) as an NO donor, SNP-primed MSC microvesicles,which were enriched with Jagged-1 and Vegf-A mRNAs, were found to improve the transplantationeﬃcacy of hematopoietic stem cells by enhancing Jagged-1 and Vegf-A expression [ 130]. In addition,exosomes from MSCs pre-conditioned with H 2O2increased the proliferation and migration of HUVECsand improved skin ﬂap recovery in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion injury [131].4.5. Gene Overexpression to Improve the Function of MSC-Derived ExosomesSeveral studies have investigated the e ﬀects of gene overexpression on MSC-derived exosomes.
In 2010, one study reported that paracrine factors from GATA-4-overexpressing MSCs increased
Several studies have investigated the e ﬀects of gene overexpression on MSC-derived exosomes.In 2010, one study reported that paracrine factors from GATA-4-overexpressing MSCs increasedthe angiogenic function and survival of HUVECs [ 132]. It was then demonstrated that exosomesfrom such MSCs improved cardiac function (increasing the number of heart vessels and decreasingthe number of apoptotic cardiac cells) in an MI mouse model [ 133]. GATA-4-overexpressing MSCswere shown to contain cardioprotective, anti-apoptotic miR-19a, which activates the Akt and ERKsignaling pathways [ 134]. Likewise, exosomes secreted by CXCR4-overexpressing MSCs promoted tube
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 727 11 of 22formation by HUVECs and exerted a cardioprotective e ﬀect through the Akt signaling pathway in anMI rat model [ 135]. In another study, exosomes derived from MSCs overexpressing Akt were found topromote angiogenic functions in vitro and improve cardiac regeneration by activating platelet-derivedgrowth factor D in an acute MI rat model [ 136]. It is known that IDO mediates immunomodulatoryeﬀects of MSCs [ 137], and exosomes derived from IDO-overexpressing rat MSCs were found to increasethe number of Tregs, decrease the number of CD8+T-cells and levels of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines,and promote immune tolerance in cardiac allografts [ 138]. Exosomes from MSCs overexpressingstromal-derived factor 1a, which is involved in cardiac repair, were shown to inhibit myocardial cellapoptosis and promote regeneration of the cardiac endothelial microvascular in vivo [139].
Overexpression of miRNAs in MSCs can also enhance the cardioprotective function of exosomes.For example, exosomes derived from miR-214-overexpressing MSCs protected cardiac stem cells fromoxidative damage by silencing CaMKII [ 140]. MSCs overexpressing miR-133 produced exosomesthat decreased inﬂammation and myocardial ﬁbrosis in an acute MI rat model [ 141]. Furthermore,MSCs that overexpressed miR-93-5p and miR-146 produced exosomes that attenuated MI-inducedmyocardial damage by suppressing expression of inﬂammatory cytokines and hypoxia-inducedautophagy in vitro [140], and by decreasing expression of early growth response factor 1 in vivo [142].Exosomes derived from miR-126-overexpressing MSCs also reduced hypoxia-induced expression ofinﬂammation factors and promoted microvascular generation and myocardial cell migration in vitro ;these exosomes also decreased cardiac ﬁbrosis and the level of inﬂammatory cytokines in vivo [143].
Overexpression of certain genes in MSCs has been observed to increase the neuro-protectiveand -regenerative activity of the exosomes produced by these cells. In 2013, Xin et al. suggestedthat exosomes derived from miR-133b-overexpressing MSCs increased axon plasticity and neuriteremodeling in the ischemic boundary zone in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion(MCAO) [144]. These authors also demonstrated that astrocytes treated with exosomes derived frommiR-133b-overexpressing MSCs increased neurite branching, and elongation of cortical embryonic ratneurons in vivo [145]. Moreover, exosomes from miR-133b-overexpressing MSCs also suppressed RhoAexpression and activated ERK1, ERK2, and CREB in brain tissues in an intracerebral hemorrhage ratmodel, which resulted in attenuation of apoptosis and neurodegeneration [ 146]. In other experiments,exosomes from miR-30d-5p-overexpressing MSCs suppressed autophagy by promoting M2 polarization
of microglia and macrophages, which reversed brain injury induced by acute ischemic stroke andautophagy in an MCAO mouse model [ 140]. Finally, exosomes from miR-25-overexpressing MSCsdecreased levels of IL-1 βand TNF- αand increased the number of motor neurons in a rat model oftransient ischemia, resulting in spinal cord protection [147].The consequences of gene overexpression on the anti-tumor e ﬀects of MSCs have also beeninvestigated. Exosomes from MSCs expressing TRAIL induced apoptosis in cancer cells in vitro [148].A diﬀerent study showed that exosomes derived from miR-122-overexpressing MSCs sensitizehepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to chemotherapeutic agents (sorafenib), enhancing the antitumoractivity of sorafenib in vitro and in vivo [149]. Another study reported that exosomes from MSCs thatoverexpress a small interfering RNA against GRP78, which is overexpressed in sorafenib-resistant cancer
cells, re-sensitize HCC to sorafenib in vitro andin vivo [150]. Exosomes from miR-119a-overexpressingMSCs suppressed the proliferative, invasive, and migrative activities of glioma cells, resulted in
MSCs suppressed the proliferative, invasive, and migrative activities of glioma cells, resulted insuppression of glioma progression by downregulating ankyrin repeat and PH domain 2 in vitro [151].Exosomes from miR-16-5p-overexpressing MSCs inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion ofcolorectal cancer cells (CRCs) and promote the apoptosis of such cells by decreasing the expression ofintegrin α2in vitro [28]. Proliferation of glioma stem cell line is reduced by treatment with exosomesfrom miR-124a-overexpressing MSCs in vitro [152]. Furthermore, treatment of mice bearing implantedGSC267 glioblastoma cells with exosomes from miR-124a-overexpressing MSCs improves the survivalrate of the mice [ 152]. In other work, the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells was shown tobe inhibited in vitro by exosomes from miR-143-overexpressing MSCs via downregulation of trefoil
factor 3 [ 153]. In another study, the proliferative, migrative, and invasive activities of oral cancer cells
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 727 12 of 22were suppressed by exosomes from miR-101-3p-overexpressing MSCs via targeting of collagen type Xalpha 1 chain [154].Gonzalez-King et al. demonstrated that exosomes from HIF-1 α-overexpressing MSCsimproved tube formation by HUVECs and induced new vessel formation in vivo through aJagged 1-dependent mechanism [ 155]. Some studies have reported that exosomes derived fromgenetically modiﬁed MSCs have a bone regenerative function. Exosomes from miR-140-overexpressingMSCs increased the proliferative and migrative activities of articular chondrocytes in vitro andattenuated symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) in vivo [156]. Other research showed that exosomesfrom miR-92a-3p-overexpressing MSCs promoted chondrogenesis in vitro and suppressed cartilagedegradation in an OA mouse model by repressing WNT5A expression [ 157]. Recent studies showedthat exosomes from miR-375-overexpressing MSCs promoted osteogenic di ﬀerentiation in vitro by
inhibiting the expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 and improved bone regenerationin a calvarial defect rat model [158].Gene overexpression has also been shown to enhance the therapeutic e ﬀects of MSC-derivedexosomes in models of liver and lung diseases. Exosomes from miR-181-5p-overexpressing MSCsdownregulated collagen I, vimentin, and ﬁbronectin, and showed an anti-ﬁbrotic function in a liverﬁbrosis mouse model [ 159]. Exosomes from miR-223-overexpressing MSCs downregulated NLRP3 andcaspase-1, and exhibited protective e ﬀects in injured hepatocytes and an experimental autoimmunehepatitis model [ 160]. Another study showed that exosomes from miR-20a-overexpressing MSCsdownregulated beclin-I and FAS, and alleviated apoptosis and autophagy in a liver ischemia-reperfusionrat model [ 161]. In LPS-induced alveolar epithelial cells, exosomes from miR-30b-3p-overexpressing
MSCs promoted cell proliferation and diminished cell apoptosis by downregulating SAA3. Suchexosomes also showed protective e ﬀects in an ALI mouse model [ 162]. Tal et al. reported that exosomesfrom miR-126-3p-overexpressing MSCs stimulated angiogenesis and collagen maturity in a diabeticrat model [ 156]. Exosomes from miR-125b-overexpressing MSCs were reported to repress Myo1eexpression and suppress the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro andin vivo, suppressing neointimal hyperplasia [163].5. ConclusionsThe number of exosome-related manuscripts, and the funding to support this work, areexponentially growing, representing enthusiasm about this area of research [ 164]. In particular,MSC-derived exosomes are being extensively investigated as potential treatments for various intractablediseases (Table 2). MSC-derived exosomes have captured attention as possible therapeutic agents
because they carry most of the therapeutic e ﬀect of the MSCs themselves. Moreover, exosomes are acell-free therapy, which would minimize safety concerns about injecting live cells. The therapeuticeﬃcacy of MSC-derived exosomes has been shown in heart, kidney, lung, skin, muscle, and braindiseases. In many cases, the mode of action of such exosomes in treating diseases is derived from theiranti-inﬂammatory activity. MSC-derived exosomes contain anti-inﬂammatory components, whichare delivered to the recipient cells, reducing inﬂammation. Taking advantage of these characteristics,MSC-derived exosomes can be applied to various inﬂammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases.Interestingly, exosome activity can be easily manipulated by pre-conditioning of MSCs, simply byadding cytokines or chemicals into the culture medium, introducing gene modiﬁcations, or usinghypoxic culture conditions. CRISPR /Cas9, a recent genome editing technology also can be applied to
improving the therapeutic e ﬃcacy of MSC-derived exosomes (Figure 2) [165].Many factors and concerns should be resolved before MSC-derived exosomes are applied clinically.
improving the therapeutic e ﬃcacy of MSC-derived exosomes (Figure 2) [165].Many factors and concerns should be resolved before MSC-derived exosomes are applied clinically.First, standards for exosome purity should be established. To date, vesicle size and expression ofmarkers (CD63, CD9, CD81) have been used to identify isolated exosomes. However, in some cases,these methods can result in contaminated mixtures. Therefore, guidelines for purity and levels ofacceptable contamination of isolated exosomes are necessary. Second, standards for quality control(QC) of isolated MSC-derived exosomes should be established. MSCs have di ﬀerent physiological
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 ,21, 727 13 of 22states, which could a ﬀect the therapeutic e ﬃcacy of derived exosomes [ 166]. The issue could beaddressed in part by using pre-conditioning or MSCs derived from induced pluripotent stem cellsor embryonic stem cells [ 167], because those approaches could minimize the lot-to-lot variationfound for primary naive MSCs. Deﬁning markers for QC will also be helpful. If speciﬁc miRNAs,peptides, or cytokines could be used as reliable indicators, then QC for isolated exosomes wouldbe robust. Taken together, results from a large body of work indicate that MSC-derived exosomeshave tremendous potential as therapeutic agents for treating several intractable diseases, especiallyinﬂammatory conditions. E ﬀorts to establish guidelines and standards for e ﬃcacy and safety issues inconjunction with pre-conditioning approaches for the therapeutic e ﬀects of exosomes will accelerateclinical applications of MSC-derived exosomes.
