One of the key mechanisms of MSC ef ﬁcacy appears to derive from theirparacrine activity. Recently, it has been shown that the secretion of different factors through extracellular vesicles known asexosomes, orchestrate the principle mechanisms of action of MSCs after infusion. The use of MSC-derived exosomes mayprovide considerable advantages over their counterpart live cells, potentially reducing undesirable side effects including
infusional toxicities. In this review, we examine clinical trials of MSC-derived exosomes currently in progress for genedelivery, regenerative medicine, and immunomodulation. In addition, we summarize the limitations and clinical potential ofthis cell-free therapeutic strategy.IntroductionMesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) are commonlyused in cellular therapy trials for immunomodulation andregenerative medicine [ 1–3]. It was previously proposedthat MSCs exert their therapeutic effect by migrating tosites of damage, engrafting, and interacting with othercells after infusion. More recently numerous in vivo stu-dies demonstrated that the therapeutic bene ﬁto fM S C si sprincipally orchestrated by the paracrine secretion of abroad repertoire of growth factors, chemokines, andcytokines [ 4–6]. However, these mechanism(s) of actionare not de ﬁnitive and still under investigation. Despitetheir bene ﬁcial therapeutic effects, MSCs have several
disadvantages including the dif ﬁculty generating a con-sistent source of cells with a stable phenotype, infusionaltoxicities caused by the large cells physically trapped inthe lung microvasculature, cellular rejection by the host,ectopic tissue formation, and some reported concernsregarding the safety pro ﬁle of the cells with respect totumor formation [ 7–10].Recently, it has been shown that MSCs release numerousextracellular vesicles (EVs), including microvesicles (MVs;0.1–2 mm in diameter) and exosomes (30 –150 nm in dia-meter), which may act as paracrine mediators betweenMSCs and target cells [ 11,12]. Other studies show thatMSC-derived exosomes can recapitulate the biologicalactivity of MSCs, and may serve as an alternative to wholecell therapy [ 13,14]. The use of exosomes may presentconsiderable advantages over their cellular counterpartsdue to a higher safety pro ﬁle, lower immunogenicity, andthe inability to directly form tumors [ 15]. In contrast to the
relatively large MSCs (30 –60 µm in diameter), nanosizedexosomes, have the potential to migrate ef ﬁciently to thetarget organ after infusion without getting trapped in thelung microvasculature [ 15,16].Similar to exosomes derived from other cells types,MSC-derived exosomes participate in intercellular com-munication and carry proteins, mRNA and microRNA(miRNA), into targeted cells [ 11]. To date, more than 850unique gene products and 150 miRNAs have been identi ﬁedin MSC-derived exosomes [ 17,18]. Previous studies indi-cate that the phenotype and function of MSC-derived exo-somes may vary depending upon the source of MSCs [ 16].Comparative studies of RNA sequencing of MSC-derivedexosomes isolated from human bone marrow and adiposetissue reveal marked differences in tRNA species de ﬁned bySox2, POU5F1A/B, and Nanog expression, which seems tobe associated with the differentiation status of MSCs [ 19].In addition, the source of MSCs has been reported to
inﬂuence the biological effects of MSC-derived exosomes[16]. A recent study compared the therapeutic bene ﬁts ofhuman MSCs derived from endometrium, bone marrow,*Elizabeth Shpall

and adipose tissues in a rat model of myocardial infarction[20]. The data con ﬁrmed the superior cardioprotection byendometrial relative to bone marrow and adipose-derivedMSCs [ 20]. These results suggest that innate differences ofMSC-derived exosomes due to their original source mayplay a key role in their clinical ef ﬁcacy.In addition to their intrinsic properties, MSC-derivedexosomes are ideal vehicles to carry and deliver moleculesto targeted cells including therapeutic genes, drugs,enzymes, or RNA [ 13]. Several studies show that MSC-derived exosomes can protect their cargo against degradationand facilitate their intracellular uptake via endocytosis [ 13].Exosomes have recently been shown to have intrinsichoming capabilities similar to their parental cell type [ 21].Therefore, MSC-derived exosomes may represent an idealdelivery system to transiently modulate processes in speci ﬁctarget cells. Moreover, similar to their parental cells, the
surface of exosomes could be modi ﬁed to enhance cell typespeciﬁc targeting [ 21], which turns MSC-derived exosomesinto promising tools for cell-free based therapeutics.MSC-derived exosomes in clinical trialsCurrently, 93 clinical trials involving exosomes are listed inwww.clinicaltrials.gov . The majority of these trials focus onthe use of exosomes from several body ﬂuids as earlydiagnostic tools to predict the outcome of various treat-ments. MSC-derived exosomes have been shown in pre-clinical studies to be safe and scalable to large, clinicallyrelevant doses [ 13]. However, the clinical use of MSC-derived exosomes is limited. This is partly due to the factthat the translation of MSC-derived exosome-based thera-pies from the preclinical studies to the clinic requires theresolution of critical parameters. Among the major issues tobe addressed are establishment of the optimal MSC cultureconditions and protocols for exosome production, isolation,
and storage that provide uniformity between batches, opti-mal dose, and schedule of exosomes administration, and thedevelopment of potency assays, which allow the evaluationof efﬁcacy [ 2,14,16]. There are currently three clinicaltrials evaluating MSC-derived exosomes reported to Clin-icaltrials.gov and a fourth trial that has been published.MSC-exosomes for diabetesTheﬁrst trial, led by Nassar et al. at the Sahel TeachingHospital and Cairo University, opened in April 2014(NCT02138331) and assesses the effect of allogeneic cordtissue MSC-derived MVs on B-cell mass in type 1 diabetesmellitus patients. In the preclinical studies leading to thistrial, MSC-derived exosomes were shown to effectivelysuppress autoimmunity and prevent the onset of the diseasein established mouse models of type 1 diabetes andexperimental autoimmune uveoretinitis [ 22,23]. Resultsindicated that MSC-derived extravesicles suppress devel-opment of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells restoring the
balance between Th1 and Th2 immunological responses[22]. The study is evaluating the administration of con-secutive doses of MSC-derived exosomes and MSC-derivedMVs in 20 patients with type 1 diabetes. Patients receive theﬁrst dose of MSC-derived exosomes intravenously, thatwere isolated from the supernatant produced from1.22 –1.51 × 106MSCs/kg. Seven days after the ﬁrst dose,the patients receive a second dose containing MVs isolatedfrom the supernatant produced from the same dose of MSCsused in the ﬁrst infusion. Exosomes and MVs were char-acterized by the expression of exosome markers (CD63,CD9, Alix, TSG101, and HSP 70) and MV markers(Annexin V, Flotilin-2, selectin, integrin, and CD40metalloproteinase), respectively. At the end of study(3 months) the following parameters are being evaluated:liver functions tests, kidney functions tests, HbA1c, glucosetolerance test, fasting and 2 h postprandial blood glucoselevels, C-peptide chain level, and calculated total daily
liver functions tests, kidney functions tests, HbA1c, glucosetolerance test, fasting and 2 h postprandial blood glucoselevels, C-peptide chain level, and calculated total dailyinsulin dose. The clinical results from this trial have not yetbeen published.MSC-exosomes for chronic kidney diseaseIn addition to conducting the study described above, Nassaret al. published their results of a phase II/III clinical trialusing cord tissue MSC-derived EVs to ameliorate the pro-gression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) [ 24]. In thisstudy, 20 patients who have been diagnosed for more than6 months with chronic kidney disease (eGFR 15 –60 mg/ml)were treated with two doses (1 week apart) of MSC-derivedEVs (100 μg/kg/dose). The ﬁrst dose was administeredintravenously and the second dose infused into the renalartery [ 24]. The primary endpoint was the safety and thesecondary endpoint was the ef ﬁcacy of treatment assessedby improvements in eGFR levels and/or reduction in serum
creatinine. Patients treated with MSC-derived EVs exhib-ited improved eGFRs and urinary albumin creatinine ratio,as well as signi ﬁcant decreases in BUN and creatinine at1 year [ 24]. In addition, the patients showed a signi ﬁcantincrease in plasma levels of TGF-B and IL-10 with per-sistent signi ﬁcant decreases in TNF- α[24].MSC exosomes for macular degenerationThe second ongoing trial (NCT03437759), led by Zhanget al. at the Tianjin Medical University Eye Hospital, was790 M. Mendt et al.
initiated in March 2017. This study is evaluating thesafety and ef ﬁc a c yo fe x o s o m e si s o l a t e df r o mc o r dt i s s u e -derived MSCs to promote healing of large and refractorymacular holes in the eye. Preceding preclinical studiesshowed that systemic transplantation of MSCs reducedthe in ﬂammatory response and limited the damage in amodel of laser-injured retina by regulation of the intrao-cular microenvironment in a paracrine manner [ 25].A comparative animal study revealed that transplantationof both MSCs and/or their corresponding exosomesreduced retinal damage and inhibited apoptosis inducedby laser injury partially by t he downregulation of MCP-1[26]. Together, these results led to their hypothesis thatMSCs and MSC-derived exosomes may improve thevisual outcomes of surgery for refractory macular holes.On this trial, cord tissue MSC-derived exosomes are iso-lated via sequential ultracentrifugation and resuspended in
PBS. Forty-four patients with a con ﬁrmed diagnosis ofmacular holes will receive a single dose of 20 –50 mg ofMSC-derived exosomes in 10 ml of PBS injected directlyaround macular hole area. The participants will be fol-lowed up for at least 6 months via Best corrected visualacuity measurement, fundoscopy, optical coherencetomography, and physical ex amination. Results are pre-dicted to be ready by December 2018.MSC exosomes for ischemic strokeThe most recent clinical trial (NCT03384433) will beginaccrual in October 2018. Led by Zali et al. at the ShahidBeheshti University of Medical Sciences, the study aimsto determine the safety and ef ﬁcacy of bone marrowMSC-derived exosomes genetically manipulated to con-tain miR-124 in patients wit h acute ischemic stroke.A recent preclinical study showed that MSC-derivedexosomes loaded with miR-124 ameliorated brain injure,promoted neurovascular rec overy after stroke, and pre-vented postischemic immunosuppression in mice [ 27].
The Phase 1/2 clinical trial aims to determine the bene-ﬁcial effect of MSC-derived exosomes transfected withmiR-124 administrated 1 month after the stroke, via ste-reotactic guidance into the ischemic area. Five patientswill receive a single dosage of 200 mg total protein ofallogenic MSC-derived exosomes loaded with miR-124.The primary endpoint is safety in the ﬁrst 12 monthsfollowing therapy with docu mentation of adverse eventsincluding progressive or recurrent stroke, brain edema,seizures, and ischemic to he morrhagic transformation.The secondary outcome, ef ﬁc a c yw i l lb em e a s u r e db yt h eimprovement in the modi ﬁed Rankin Scale during the ﬁrstyear posttreatment.Future directions of MSC-derived exosometherapiesMSC-derived exosome therapy is emerging as a promisingstrategy for the treatment of several diseases, in particularthose with an in ﬂammatory component [ 12]. Their innateability to transport genetic material, protecting it from
extracelluar degradation and delivering it in a highlyselective manner to recipient cells suggests that MSC-derived exosomes are an ideal delivery system for smallmolecules as well as gene therapies for cancer and poten-tially regenerative medicine [ 12,28]. In addition, encoura-ging preclinical data demonstrated that MSC-derivedexosome therapeutics might could be superior to cell-basedtherapy in terms of safety and versatility [ 12,29–31].However, critical technological considerations and deter-mination of possible side effects need to be addressed inorder to optimize their clinical use [ 31]. Also, with the rapidprogress of bioengineering and cellular modi ﬁcation tech-niques, the next step in the exosome ﬁeld will be theengineering or modi ﬁcation of the exosome surface andcontent, which may allow superior speci ﬁcity, expandingtheir use to more complex areas of medicine.Compliance with ethical standards
