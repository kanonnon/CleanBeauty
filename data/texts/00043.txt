In this region, the conspicuousness xof the prey population should increase, whereas it should decreaseoutside the region (arrows in Fig. 2). Starting with the originalconspicuousness value x0(.0) of the cryptic wild type (Box 3),conspicuousness xwill evolve and lead to a higher level (indicated inFig. 2 by the thick part of the curve line) once Nexceeds a thresholdvalue N0(determined by the intersection between the curve line andthe line x¼x0in Fig. 2). Thus, although the evolution of apose-matism proceeds in a gradual manner, a great discontinuity in thedegree of conspicuousness is created as a result of the evolution.This discontinuity predicted by the model can explain the unam-biguous distinction in appearance between many aposematic species
and their closely related cryptic species, which is observed in nature.We have shown that a predator’s generalization with peak shift,which creates a substantial associative learning of a rare mutant bythe predator solely experiencing an abundant wild type, may over-come the two barriers to the initial evolution of aposematismpointed out by Guilford1,2, helping the initial evolution of apose-matism to occur.It has been suggested that aposematism may evolve by gradualchange21. Our model provides a mechanism for, and thus supports,this idea. Peak shift has been shown to be a stabilizing force onceaposematism has evolved5,13: our model reveals that peak shift canalso be a driving force for the initial evolution of aposematism.We have assumed that c¼1, but if c¼cðx;uÞ, our modelindicates that not only peak shift, but also increasing memoryretention toward greater conspicuousness ( cxðx;uÞ,0), can giverise to the evolution of aposematism (Box 4).

females5,7–11, and to dominance and immunocompetence inmales5,12,13. Here we report the results of asking subjects tochoose the most attractive faces from continua that enhanced ordiminished differences between the average shape of female andmale faces. As predicted, subjects preferred feminized to averageshapes of a female face. This preference applied across UK andJapanese populations but was stronger for within-populationjudgements, which indicates that attractiveness cues are learned.Subjects preferred feminized to average or masculinized shapes ofa male face. Enhancing masculine facial characteristics increasedboth perceived dominance and negative attributions (for example,coldness or dishonesty) relevant to relationships and paternalinvestment. These results indicate a selection pressure that limitssexual dimorphism and encourages neoteny in humans.Computer-graphic techniques can be used to construct ‘average’
male and female faces by digitally blending photographs of indivi-duals of the same sex14(Fig. 1). Sexual dimorphism in face shape canthen be enhanced or diminished14,15(Fig. 2).
