The degree of protection offered by such clothing depends on a number of factors. III this paper, an attempt has been made to coalesce the ideas of the various researchers who have developed ultra­violet protective clothing, and to understand the influence of UV rays on the structure and morphology of fibres, fabrics and
fabric assemblies. The effects of humidity, chemical processing. dyeing with reactive/direct/vat dyes on cellulosics and their blends, and linishing chemicals on sun protection factor have also been highlighted.

Its spec­trum extends up to about 3000 nm at sea level. Small doses of ultraviol et solar radiation are beneficial to humans. But large doses of UV radiation have detri­mental effects such as sunburn, skin cancer, photo­keratitis, cataract, etc. Increasing incidence of skin cancer is a major concern throughout the world. The most common type of skin cancers are squamous cell and basal cell cancers. However , malignant melanoma is posing a more serious problem , due to excessive sun expo­sure. Approximately 90% of non-melanoma and
sure. Approximately 90% of non-melanoma and 65% of melanoma skin cancers have been attributed to ultraviolet exposure. Incidence of skin cancer in Australia and USA are shown in Fig. I.The rate of skin cancer in New Zealand and Norway also seems to be very high. Even in Great Britain, the number of persons affected with skin cancer appears to be rising. In Scotland, there was a rise of 82% in mela­noma cases over that during 1979-1992. Recogniz­ing these facts, it is important to protect skin from excessive exposure of UV radiation. Using simula­tion of spectrum of solar radiation , Hilfiker et al.' have studied the function of various parameters , viz. "To whom all the correspondence should be addressed .

They have observed that the critical
time for sun burn is less than 30 min at 40° latitude even in autumn at ten 0' clock in the morning. It has also been shown that for brown skin, the critical dose at 290-300 nm for skin reddening is much less for white skin which always burns easily (Table I). Madronich and Gruiji2 have shown the increase in skin cancer incidence due to ozone layer depletion (Fig. 2), using Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) aboard the Nimbus 7 satellite. This clearly shows that the ozone layer depletion reduces to minimum, i.e. at 5N and 5S latitudes, the ozone de­pletion is only 0.6 and 1.1 respectively. However, the relation between skin cancer incidence and ul­traviolet dose is generally non-line ar and is repre­sented by an exponential model). ~ 1000 USA 12:1 7000 Australia Fig. I-Death in Australia and United States due to skin cancer (refs 1,4 & 5)

• High energy UV-B rays (IL = 280-320 nm): It penetrates to a depth of few mm into the skin and forms stable pigment in the epidermis of the skin. Melanoma or skin cancer is increased considerably due to the prolonged exposure of UV -B rays. • Low energy UV-A rays (IL = 320-400 nm) : It penetrates into the skin, leading to prematur e age­ing. But its effect is only nominal and of short du­ration. Before understanding the influence of various tex­ti Ie parameters on UV protection, it is necessary to define the protection factor first. The ultraviolet pro­tection factor (UPF) or the sun protection factor (SPF) is the factor by which the period of exposure to sun can be extended without reddening the skin4.5. The UV protection factor is calculated by using the following equation: 400 11111 2.EASAD.A UP F = ED = _2R_'O_"_I11 ___ _ ED 400,"" III 2. EASATAD.A ...

BAJAJ elol: SOME INNOVAT IONS IN UV PROTECTIVE CLOTHING 317 The ultraviol et protection factor is strongly de­pendent on the chemical nature of the fibres. Grey cotton exhibits moderate absorption in the UV region, may be due to the presence of pigments, pectins and waxes6-8. Grey jute also shows strong absorption in the UV region, but no compara tive study is available between grey cotton and grey jute. The strong ab­sorption of jute may be due to the presence of lignin which acts as a natural UV absorber7. Wool in con­trast absorbs strongly, i.e. lower transmittance over 280-400 nm and even far beyond 400 nm. Silk occu­pies an intermediate position; it has been found to be more absorbent than cotton but less than wool as shown in Fig. 3a. Dull viscose (TiOrtreated) shows strong absorp­tion as compared to lustrous viscose. Thus, a dull vis­cose fabric (I 05g/m2) with 22 weft threads/cm showed a UPF of 13 while the lustrous viscose fabric
(107 g/m2) with the same number of weft threads/cm showed a UPF rating of 9. Presence of Ti02 reduces the UV transmission and provides higher UPF due to . 8 scattering. Polyester fibre absorbs more (less transmittance) in the UV-A and UV-B region than acrylic and poly­amide fibres (Fig. 3b). However, aliphatic polyamides are relatively permeable to UV rays and are less ef­fective in UV protection than aromatic polyamides. The presence of aromatic groups enhances the UV absorption property as is the case with polyester. Low SPF of acrylic fibre may be attributed to the dipolar interaction of the nitrile groups. Hilfiker et al.' have reported that thin, untreated fabrics made from cot­ton, silk, polyamide and polyacrylonitrile offer SPF only in the range of 3-5. 3.2 Humidity The relative humidity and/or moisture content af­fects the UPF or SPF of a fabric in two ways. The
more moisture the fibre absorbs, the larger will be the fibre cross-section due to swelling. This reduces the space between the ends and picks by which the fabric density is increased, consequently diminishing the UV transmittance . On the other hand, the presence of water reduces scattering effects as the refractive in­dex of water is closer to that of textile polymers as compare d to air, and hence a greater UV transmission vis-a-vis a lower UPF. Actual UPF thus depends on the interaction of swelling of fibre and scattering of light. 60 (0) 50-1.0 Cotton 30 ~ 0 20 ~ u c a ----.§ VI c: 0 ( b) c:..

RES., DECEMBER 2000 can't be related to humidity. 3.3 Fabric Construction 3.3.1 Fabric Thickness/Weight Dependence of humidity is most pronounc ed in silk and viscose fabric (Fig. 4). Viscose has a high water absorption and swelling capacity while silk has poor swelling properties. But silk fibres are very fine ensuring a high number of ends and picks, which means that even mild swelling would lead to substantial reduction of the open surface (porosity) and consequently a decrease in UV transmittance. For cotton, although an effect similar to viscose was expected, the finishing treatment might prevent the fabric from swelling? Polyester has a low absorp­tion and swelling capacity and that is why the UPF With the increase in fabric thickness, the fabric UPF/SPF increases with the same fabric construction (Fig. 5). For the same fabric construction, SPF in­creases with increase in the fabric weight also. As the
weight of a cotton fabric increases from I 10 g/m2 to 165 g/m2 and thickness from 0.18 mm to 0.52 mm, SPF increases from 3.2 to 5 (Table 3).

On the other hand, both thread count and cloth cover are good predictors of UPF on fabrics of average thick­ness. However, thread count and cloth cover have
ness. However, thread count and cloth cover have been found to be the poor predictors of UPF for thin woven cotton fabrics. 3.3.2 Fabric Weave Design of the fabric also affects the UV transmis­sion. Obviously, the tighter the weave, the greater will be the UV protection. Loosely structured fabrics will afford very little protection. For the woven fab­rics of same weight, the plain weave designs give the highest protection. 3.3.3 Fabric Cover Factor/Porosity Cover factor is essentially concerned with the por­tion of the fabric surface that is covered by yarn. Cover factor is related to UPF as follows: UPF = 100 100 Porosity 100 -cover factor ... (2) Thus, to obtain a higher UPF, the cover factor must be high. Substantial improvement in UPF has been shown when the cover factor exceeds to 95% (Fig. 6). The importance of cover factor is realized while considering the effect of stretching and mechanical Exhaust or pad batch Exhaust or pad batch 3.8 37 10 29
Exhaust or pad batch 3.8 37 10 29 finishing. Stretch reduces the UPF rating of a fabric during wear as the effective cover factor is reduced. For example, in nylon/lycra type garment the UPF is significantly reduced due to stretching in comparison to the UPF measured in a relaxed state. Any mechani­cal finishing that increases the cover factor will also increase the fabric UPF. Thus, the overfeed on the stenter allows the fabric to shrink, which increases the cover factor and as a consequence, the fabric UPF increases. Underfeed on the stenter, with the same argument, reduces the fabric UPF. Compressiv e shrinkage such as 'compacting' and 'sanforizing' in­creases the cover factor vis-a-vis the fabric UPF. Laundering/washing during wear also has a sig­nificant effect on the cover factor. It was observed that for a 100% cotton long sleeve T-shirt (with a UPF rating of 15), the UPF rating increased to 35 af­ter first washing, primarily due to the consolidation
shrinkage, i.e. due to an increase in the cover factor8 Porosity, i.e. the number of pores per unit of fabric surface, has an inverse relation with cover factor. Therefore, with a decrease in porosity the sun protec­tion factor (SPF) increases (Fig. 6). 3.4 Chemical Processing 3.4.1 Bleaching
320 INDIAN J. FIBRE TEXT. RES., DECEMB ER 2000 White fabrics made of bleached cotton and viscose provide relatively low SPF in comparison to the grey fabrics with the same construction. This is because the natural pigments, pectins, waxes, etc. in raw cot­ton, which act as UV absorbers, are removed during bleachinglD. 3.4.2 Dyeing For all dyes, the absorption band extends to UV radiation spectrum (280-400 nm) and all the dyes, therefore, can act as UV absorbers .. The extinction coefficients of these dyes determine their ability to increase the UPF of fabric. UV absorbing capacity of each dye is unique to that dyestuff, and hence it is very difficult to gene-'-200 -t; o "-is 150 ~ u .2! !l. 100 c :> Vl x 50 o 1: 10 ------- ____ _ ralise. However, from the study of Reinert et al. lion the influence of dyeing on various fibres, it was re­vealed that the sun protection properties were im­proved on dyeing, irrespective of the chemical nature
of the fibres. In their experiment, two cotton fabrics differing in porosity and thickness were dyed to pale and deep shades with Cibacrori reactive dyes. The sun protection properties of both the fabrics were im­proved (Table 4). However, Reinert et al. II and Pailt­horpe and Cruiskis 7 have demonstrated that the darker the shade of any colour, the higher would be the pro­tection, indicating that the dark coloured fabrics transmit less UV rays than lighter shade fabrics. However , no correlation between the chemical struc­ture of the dyes and UPF has been established as the Fig. 6-Sun protection factor as a function of cover factor and porosity (ref. 26) Table 4-EITcct of dyes on UV protection factorJII-12.24 Fabric Thickness Porosity Sample Dyes applied Method of UPF mm % application Cotton 0.20 3.05 Control 3 Dyed (Pale yel-Reactive dye IIIOSD Exhaust or pad 7 low) (Cibacron batch Yellow F4G) III SO 23 Dyed (Blue) Reactive dye 1I10SD Exhaust or pad 6

They have only reported that black, navy blue and dark green dyes significantly improve fabric UPFs whereas very pale shades provide only small im­provement in UPF (Fig. 7). For example, a bleached and mercerized fabric with 135 g/m2 weight, 0.20 mm thickness, 3.05% porosity and dyed with Yel­low F-4G-Cibacron dyes with 1/10 standard depth resulted in the UPF of 7; the same dye with 1/1 standard depth showed the UPF of 23. However, for wool fabric with a high porosity (4.07%), even a
wool fabric with a high porosity (4.07%), even a black shade could not improve the UPF to a large extent (UPF=29). The porosity imposes a limitation here. This was clear when another wool fabric hav­ing a much less porosity (0.63%) was dyed with the same dye. The UPF achieved was much higher than 50 (Table 4). With Silk fabrics, the improvement is very marginal with a pale shade, while with black shade, a high UPF (250) can be achieved when the porosity is not too high. Polyester fabrics in general show a high UPF. However, in case of staple-fibre fabric, due to the high porosity, dyeing even with black dyes even did not improve the UPF to a large extent. With polyamide, SPF was improved by dye­ing, but here also, limitations were imposed by the porosity and thickness of the fabrics.

Structure I Suitable reactive dyes for increasing the sun pro­tection factor of cellulosic fibres have also been triedl4. The sun protection factor of cotton can be in­creased by reaction with the following reactive dye (Structure TI). Structure II Vat dyes have also been used for increasing the sun protection factor of cellulosic fabrics. When ap­plied by dyeing or printing, these dyes act as sun­screen for cellulosics, especially for cotton. A 0.2 mm thick cotton fabric treated with 2.4% of the vat dye (Structure III) showed solar protection factor of 54 (determined by CIE D65) compared to 3 for untreated fabric 1 S. o Structure III 4 Finishing with UV Absorbers
o Structure III 4 Finishing with UV Absorbers UV absorbers are inorgani c or organic substances capable of selectively absorbing short wave solar ra­diation in the spectral region 280-400 nm and of re­storing the absorbed energy intact to the environm ent. They are often used as UV screen agents. These UV screcners absorb part of the incident light and reduce the amount of light striking epidermis of the skin, . 16-19 causmg sun burn . Chemical compounds suitable for UV absorbers must meet the following criteria: • It should absorb effectively throughout the UV region (280-400 nm), but especially in 350-400 nm region. • It must be UV stable itself . • ]t must dissipate the absorbed energy in such a manner so as to cause no degradation or colour change in the medium it protects. The most im­portant chemical classes include: o-hydroxybenzo­phenone, o-hydroxyphenylbenzotriazole and o-hydroxyphenyltriazine. Of the inorganic substances with UV absorbing
Of the inorganic substances with UV absorbing properties, titanium dioxide (Ti02) deserves special mention. The improved UV protection is attributed to reflection and scattering of the UV rays20. 4.1 Application Methods Ciba Geigy offers a variety of UV absorbers that can be applied on the fabric by either exhaust or pad batch method: . Cibatex UPF is a water soluble oxaldianilide with two reactive groups. It is applied by exhaust (1-4%) or pad batch (15-50 gil) method along with reactive or direct dyes. It is reported to have excellent fastness propertie s. Cibafast W is a monosulphonated benzotriazole derivative. It is suitable for wool, silk, polyamide and their blends. It is applied under a id dyeing condi­tions, preferably by exhaust (1-3%) method. Cibatex APS is an UV absorber used for polyester and its blends. It is a dispersion of a benzotriazole derivative and is applied at 1-3% by exhaustion with disperse dyes. The effect of these UV absorbers on
diffuse UV transmittance of different fabrics is shown in Figs 8-1 I. Solartex CEL is recommended for dyeing/printing either by exhaust or cold pad batch technique. So­lartext CUT is recommended for finishing with usual recipes with softeners and resins. Solartex UVP is used for combined protection against sun burn and rain. The application concentration of these products is 1-4%. They are applied either by exhaust or cold pad batch technique. Reinert and Hilfiker21 described a process in which the sun protection of the fabric can be improved by treating with UV absorber UV A-I based on triazine and UV A-2 based on hydroxytri azole. It may be seen from Fig. 12 that with UV A-I, the maximum SPF is only 25. This is due to the fact that UV A-I has an upper absorption limit of about 315 nm (Fig. 13) and
BAJAJ el {II: SOME INNOVATIONS IN UV PROTECT IVE CLOTHING 323 therefore it can never yield a very high SPF. On the other hand, its extinction coefficient at 310 nm is very high and, therefore, the SPF increases steeply for very small UY A concentration. With UY A-2 however, due to a higher upper absorption limit at around 350 nm, the maximum SPF is much higher. 50 ~ .-'-'-' 40 .-IU .-u .---.C:: ·~~out.UVA 0 ..... +-30 "E III c 0 20 ..= '" III OJ 10 -<0-with UVA 0 0280 320 Wavelength (nmJ Fig. 8-DilTuse transmittance spectra of cotton with and without UV absorber (2% Cibatex UPF) (ref.

Clariant has launched some UV absorbers for pro­tection of skin under the trade name Rayosan. These Rayosan products can be applied by any normal tex­tile finishing method on yarn, knitwear or woven fab­ric using the conventional textile finishing equipment. Two products have been introduced, viz. Rayosan C paste for cellulosic fibres and polyamides, and Rayo­san P liquid for polyester fibres. Rayosan C paste can be applied by exhaust or con­tinuous method, normally as a finishing process. It can be applied during dyeing on cellulosics together
with Drimarene-K dyestuffs, and 011 polyamides to­gether with acid dyes. It absorbs primarily in UV-C and UV-B regions, and very little in the UV-A region. Therefore, it has very little or no influence on f10urescent brightening agents. These products are very fast to washing and light. Rayosan P liquid can be applied together with dis­perse dyes by exhaust method at high temperature or at the boil with carriers, and by pad thermosol con­tinuous processes. It exhibits a very high absorbing effect in the whole UV region. Palacin25 has also revealed an UV absorber composi­tion containing non-ionic sUlfactant for dyeing yarn an addition product of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide or both ethylene oxide and propylene oxide copolymer, and a mixture of fatty alcohols, faulty acids or fatty esters having preferably 14-18 carbon atoms or either tristyryl phenol or distyryl phenol. Such compositions have good storage stability and shear stability.

BAJAJ el of: SOME INNOVATIONS IN UV PROTECTIVE CLOTHING 325 This compound (Structure VII) is prepared by etheri­fication of 2,4-dihydroxy-benzophenon e with 1,3---di­chloro-2-propanol in EtOH. It was dispersed in water containing ethoxylated oleyl alcohol dispersant and the dispersion added to a dyeing bath to enhance the light fastness and UPF of a polyester tricot material. Thompson and Pailthorpe28 have described a proc­ess of increasing the SPF rating of a fibre or fabric by treating it with a UV absorber based on 2,4-difluoro-5-chloro-6-anilin opyrimidine at I % (on fibre weight) to a cotton fabric (145 g/m\ The SPF rating obtained was 51.3 ± 3.2. Ciba Speciality Chemicals has also disclosed a method for increasing the protection factor by treating textiles with non-reactive UV absorbers (c.g. oxalic anilides, hydroxybenzophenones, triazine compounds or triazole compounds, salicylic acid esters, substituted
acrylonitrile, substituted arylaminoethylenes or nitrilo­hydrazones), emulsifying agents, water and polysilox ­anes. They observed that when a cotton fabric was padded with an aqueous solution containing 20 giL mixture of an UV absorber (Structure Vlll) and non­ionic emulsifier (Lutensol ON 60 & Arlecel C) with a pickUp of 80% followed by drying and curing at 170°C for I min, the SPF of29.8 was obtained2<). H~ 25 CC~ Me Structure VIII Reinert and Kaufmann'o disclosed, in a patent, the treatment of fabrics with UV absorbers for skin protection against sunlight. The fabrics were treated with aqueous solution containing 2% of Na salt of 2,4-dichloro-s-triazine-6-yl-p-amino-o­hydroxyphenyl sulphonic acid for 30 min at 50°C, rinsed and dried to give fabrics with SPF > 25. They have also shown that bleached cotton tricot when treated with a liquor containing hydroxybcnzotriazolc
derivative (Structure IX) at 60°C for 20 min in a jet dyeing machine and then treated for another I h gave a highly UV-resistant fabric'l. Skehan :12 has disclosed a chemical named Rayosun for sunproof clothing. Rayosun is a two-component molecule, one part absorbs the UV rays while the second part reacts with the fabric. S Application of Resins Containing UV Absorber lpposha Oil Industries" has developed a process of coating the fabrics with a homopolymer or copolym er solution (0.1-7 wt%) with a molecular weight be­tween 10,000 and 800,000 which it claims to impart prolonged light resistance and ultraviolet screening action to fabrics than is normally available. A number of monomers, including 2-hydroxy-4-ac ryloyloxy benzophenon e, are suitable for this, while acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and their esters are best suited for copolymerization with monoethylenically unsatu­rated monomers. In another coating technique, Toyota Res & Dev.
In another coating technique, Toyota Res & Dev. Lab34 has described a process in which the polymers showing UV shielding and abrasion resistance are manufactur ed by dispersing organic alkoxy silanes, inorganic or organic salts or alkoxides of Ti, Mg, AI, Si, etc, and inorganic or organic polar solvents fol­lowed by moulding. Thus, 297.6 g 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy silane and 170.4 g titanium tetraisopropoxide were stirred in H20 to give 143 g powdered layered organo titanosilicat e showing good heat resistance, dis­persibility in organic solvents, and good UV shielding property. Toray Industries35 has also developed an immer­sion technique for making antibacterial UV-blocking fabrics. A polyester fabric was immersed in ethanol containing 3% ferulic acid, dried and heated at 190°C to give a fabric showing antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and UV absorption of 98.5 and 94.9% in the UV-B (280-320 nm) and UV-A
and 94.9% in the UV-B (280-320 nm) and UV-A (320-400 nm) regions respectively. Multifun ctional polymeric UV absorbers for pho­tostabilization of wool have been studied by Riedel and Hocke,)6. The most effective ones are derivatives of 2-hydroxybenzoph enone and hydroxyphenyl ben­
tostabilization of wool have been studied by Riedel and Hocke,)6. The most effective ones are derivatives of 2-hydroxybenzoph enone and hydroxyphenyl ben­zotriazole which show highest absorbanc e in the range of 290-360 nm. Photoyellowing of wool can be reduced up to 50% when UV absorbers with polymethacryl ate backbone are applied. 6 Application of Optical Brightening Agents Optical brightening agents (OSAs) are often ap-
326 INDIAN J. FIBRE TEXT. RES., DECEMBER 2000 plied to enhance the whiteness of textiles by inducing fluorescence by UV excitation and visible blue emis­sion. This phenomenon of excitation and emission is caused by the transition of electrons involving p-orbitals from either conjugated or aromatic com­pounds. These optical brightening agents are highly conjugated derivatives of stilbene, benztriazole or benzimidazo le which have been derivatized to give them water solubility or polar characteris tics to be atrracted to the fabric substrate on which they will be used. Most OBAs have excitation maxima in the very near UV or at the lower end of the visible scale in the range of 340-400 nm. Hence, OBAs can improve sun protection factor of textile material. It has been shown that OBA used in laundering improve the UV blocking ability of cotton fabrics and cotton/polyester blend fabrics but not of the fabrics comprised entirely of polyester and nylon.
of polyester and nylon. OBAs have the added benefit of increasing the UY absorption properties and hence, the sun protection facto,)7-4o. However, . the effect of OBAs can be quenched slightly to completely when UV absorber s are applied depending on the absorptio n properties of the two products. As a result, ultraviol et spectropho­to meters used to measure spectral transmittance can exhibit systematic errors when fluoresce nt samples are introduced. 7 Development of UV-Resistant Fibres Du-pont41 has developed UY -resistant core-sheath elastomeric monofilament which comprises a poly­ether ester, polyester urethane or polyester amide core and polyether ester, polyester urethane or polyester amide sheath having melting point at least 20DC lower than the core and each containing about 1.8-3.0 weight % carbon to protect from UV radiation. Duan and Zhang42 have described a process in which the composite fibres, comprising titanate­
which the composite fibres, comprising titanate­coupling agent treated BaS04 containing polyprop yl­ene core and titanate-treated powdered AI or UV ab­sorber containing polypropylene sheath, were woven into fabrics which showed good UV shielding ability. Kuraray Co. of Japan43 has developed UV-ray shielding base fabric in which the fibres, consisting of a polyester and 10% Ti-oxide, ZnO and/or alumina as a core and a polyester containing 2 mol% sul­foisophthalic acid units as the sheath were together melt spun at 45:55 ratio, twisted, made into a woven taffeta and dyed to give a fabric with UV permeation of only 1.5%. Teijin Ltd44 has also developed a core-sheath com­posite fibre. Polyester containing 1.5% Ti02 particles as the sheath and polyamide as core were melt spun at core/sheath ratio 50:50 and drawn. This fibre showed a high UV protection. Other innovations45-53 in producing UV-resistant fibres include a new range of fabrics called ENKA
SUN, developed by Azko Nobel in collaboration with Lenzing , to provide the wearer with a sun protection factor of 30+. The product Enka Sun is produced by the addition of a non-toxic, chemically inert and wa­ter insoluble pigment to continuous filament viscose yarns. These 'sun blockers' are not affected by wear­ing, washing or dry cleaning. 8 Designing of Innovative Sun-screen Fabrics Increasing awareness for sun protection has led to the development of some innovative sun-screen fab­rics. A light reflecting sun-screen developed by Poly­sack Plastic Industries54 comprises a net structure with equally spaced threads in the perpendicular di­rections. The threads are laminated strands in which a first layer of mono-orien ted transparent film is cov­ered by a second layer that essentially comprises alu­minium, while a third (again transpare nt) layer pro­tects the intermediate (reflecting) layer from deterio­ration. A composite tape and patch materials for applying
to human skin to block harmful sun exposure have been developed. These comprise a printable layer of nonwoven fabric material formed from polyester,
to human skin to block harmful sun exposure have been developed. These comprise a printable layer of nonwoven fabric material formed from polyester, nylon or cellulosic fibres and their blends, and a thin adhesive coating which is skin compatible, non-toxic, hypo-allergenic and non-irrit ati ng55. Wetmore Associates56.57 have described a ultra­violet protective fabric with a high wearer comfort. It comprises multifilament nylon warp yarns and multi­filament nylon weft yarns. The fabric is undergone sanding only on one surface, drying and jet launder­ing followed by air drying without tretching to pro­vide a fabric having a sun protection factor of at least about 30, and preferably about 70 or more. The pre­ferred warp yarn is at least 40/40 denier nylon, while the weft yarn count is preferably 80/50. With the dramatic rise in skin diseases, the hosiery market is also receiving attention as a means of UV protection. One such innovation is 'tights with sun
protectio n'. One German Compan /8 has developed such 12 denier tights with a special coating to filter the sun rays. It is claimed that over 90% of UV-A,
BAJAJ el af: SOME IN OVATIONS IN UV PROTECTIVE CLOTHING 327 UV -8 and UV -C rays are thus kept away from the skin. Klopman International59 has reported a luminex high-visibility fabric which has been certified as ex­cellent when tested against UV-A's and UV-8's as well as UV protection factor for safeguard against sunlight and skin sensitivity in accordance with AN­ZAC norm. Backmann60 has described the screens made from warp-knitted nets fo!' protection from the sun for open spaces. Glass-fibre-solar screening fabrics have been reported by Stevens Co. Tnc.61, which provide ade­quate sun protection. Crosb/2 has reported that fabrics containing mi­cro-capsules of slow release substances can screen out harmful UV rays from the sun. Screens with metallized polyester film, produced in a circular loom in the form of square-weave fab­rics, have also been reported to act as sun filters6'. Solar Fashion CO.64 has designed bathing costumes
made from SOLST AR, a net fabric which it claims to allow only one third of the sun rays to reach the skin. Arnold et al.65 have reported the use of new roller blinds or curtain-like solar absorbers as low­temperature heaters having thermal insulation effect. So, they have developed energy utilizing novel textile structures to regulate the incoming solar energy on glassed-in-areas. A new generation of screens and technical nets is . 66 T' 1 •. ' I now emerging. eXll10v I\Jllttec structures are spe-cially engineered to fulfil specific requirements. Made of high tenacity polyethylene, these are weather- and UV -resistant. Custom-made screens and nets have become an imperative necessity. Used as windbreak or sun shadowing fences, these also pro­tect against hail frost, rain, snow, insects and birds. Scientists at Quennsland Institute of Medical Re­search67 have calculated the ratio of the intensity of dangerous UV-B radiation in direct sunlight with re­
spect to the various shades used. For example, a hat gives reasonable protection across the nose and eyes, but not on the rest of the face. House awnings too were twice as effective when facing away from the sun, and beach umbrellas offer little protection from UV-B scattered from the side. 9 Methods of Measuring UPF/SPF Two methods, vi:. in vivo and ill vitro, are gener­ally used to determine SPF or UPF. In the ill l'il'O method, test subjects whose skin is covered with the textile in question are irradiated with light having a spectrum, closely resembling that of sun, while in vitro method involves measurement on human sub­ject, but the subjects are irradiated with monochro­matic light and the critical amount required to cause skin reddening (erythema) is measured. From these results, the erythemal effecti veness, the reciprocal of critical dose of a given wavelength, is determined. Thus, if the erythema action spectrum SeA) (also
Thus, if the erythema action spectrum SeA) (also termed erythemal effectiveness) of UV radiation, the spectrum of the light E (A) and the spectral transmit­tance of the sunscreen T(A) are known, the SPF can be calculated according to Eq (I). It is assumed that no synergism or antagonism of effects due to UV lights of various wavelengths exists. A possible major source of discrepancies between in vivo and in vitro SPF is the choice of illumination in in vivo tests. Since an artificial light source can never perfectly match the sunlight spectrum and a slight change of the spectrum can have a large effect on SPF, in vitro SPFs are actually more reliable than in vivo SPFs. When the UV radiation falls on a textile material, a small portion of it passes through the material while a larger portion of it is scattered in the material. This scattered light is of course also harmful to skin. So, it is important to measure the diffuse transmittance of
textiles. This can be done by fixing the material over the entrance aperture of an integrating sphere, the
is important to measure the diffuse transmittance of textiles. This can be done by fixing the material over the entrance aperture of an integrating sphere, the internal surface of which is to be lined with a highly reflective matt, for example barium sulphate p:lint. Also, the beam of radiation of the spectrophotometer should be less than ±5° about the beam axis. How­ever, the results of UPF are very much influenced by the structure of fabric, for example, for a fancy weave, which is thick in one and thin in other places68. Also, for a multicoloured fabric, each colour should be taken in turn and tested for UV transmis­sion for the whole of the fabric UV IOOOF Ultraviolet Transmittance Analyser is a special spectrometer developed for this purpose. It is compact, rugged and easy to use instrument for meas­uring the total transmittance i.e. the amount of UV rays that is directly transmitted and diffusely scat­tered by the textiles. From the percentage transmit­
tance in the UV region, the SPF is obtained through an automatic conversion. Mesa69 has described an indirect screening test for UV protective fabrics. It is a simple and rapid test to determine the sun blocking effects of fabrics, and to
328 INDIAN 1. FIBRE TEXT RES., DECEMB ER 2000 evaluate the effect that colourants and known UV absorbing materials have on sun blocking ability. In one study, wool fabrics were dyed with 2 acid dyes of known poor light fastness ec.l. Acid Green 16 and c.r. Acid Violet 17) and then exposed to xenon arc radiation behind a range of fabrics of different fibres, undyed and dyed, and treated with known UV ab­sorbers eCibafast W). Variations in fibre type, dyes and UV absorber affected the fading of the dyed wool fabrics. The two fabrics had different responses to the variables tested and thus, this seems to be potential method to assess a fabric's UV protection value. It has been recognized that UPF measurement of textiles can result in faulty UPF classification if any fIuoresence is present in the textile. Thus, not only the spectrophometer hardwar e but also the applicative know how of the instrument should be critically ana­lysed.
lysed. Greenoak and Pailthorp e7o have indicated the dis­crepancies between different testing methods found in Australian and US Standards Melanoma & Skin Can­cer Research Institute. Using the spectrophotom eter of the Swiss Federal Laborato ry for Testing Materials and Research (EMPA), the measurement values have been worked out for assessing the sun protection of texti les. Meas­urements already carried out have served to define the testing scope of the 'Project Sun Protection' launched by EMPA, in which textiles are to be assessed for . . ff' 71 their sun protection e ectlveness . Several investigators72-75 have dealt with the vari­ous aspects of sun protectiv e clothing and their test­IIlg. 10 Summary Various factors affecting the sun protection and the effective measures to improve the protection factor clearly indicate that the SPF or UPF of a fabric is de­pendent on a number of factors including fibre type,
fabric construction, nature of chemical processing and presence of additives such as UV absorbers or optical brighteners: • Natural cellulosic and lignocelloulosic fibres have a low to moderate UV absorption capacity over the entire UV region. Wool and silk have higher ab­sorption than cellulosics with wool having sub­stantial absorption than any other natural fibres. Of the synthetic fibres, acrylic has the lowest UV ab­sorption in the UV-B region. Polyester and aro­matic polyamides have higher absorption in the UV -B region, due to the presence of aromatic group, in comparison to aliphatic polyamide. • Moisture/humidity has a dual role in affecting the UPF which depends on the fibre type, chemical nature of finishes applied, etc. • High fabric thickness and weight, close weave and high cover factor also increase the UPF or SPF. • Bleaching removes some natural UV absorbers from the cellulosic and lignocellulosic fibres, thus reducing the UV absorption.
reducing the UV absorption. • Reactive, direct or vat dyes can improve the UPF of cellulosics and their blends significantly, spe­cially at higher shade depth, although the changes are influenced by the chemical structure of dyes. • UV absorbers specially based on benztriaz o!es, benzophenone, etc. can reduce th total amount of radiation affecting on the skin (UV cutting). OBAs, if present along with the UV absorber, can affect the UPF rating of fabrics depending on their absorption properties. • The measurement of UPF on a clothing material can be done by measuring the diffuse spectral transmittance (ill vitro test method) or by measur­ing the increase in exposure time required to 1l1-duce erythema or sun burn (ill I'ivo test method) References I Hilfikcr R, Kaufmann W, Rcinclt G & Schmidt E.
