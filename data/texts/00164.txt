nuclear DNA damage to human skin cells, where it serves to screen out harmfulUV radiation. Melanin is delivered to keratinocytes in the skin after being excretedas melanosomes from melanocytes. Defects in melanin production in humans cancause diseases, many of which currently lack e ﬀective treatments due to their
genetic origins (e.g., skin cancer, vitiligo, and albinism). The widespreadprevalence of melanin-related diseases and an increasing interest in theperformance of various polymeric materials related to melanin necessitatesnovel synthetic routes for preparing melanin-like materials. In this work, we prepared melanin-like nanoparticles (MelNPs) viaspontaneous oxidation of dopamine, as biocompatible, synthetic analogues of naturally occurring melanosomes, and investigatedtheir uptake, transport, distribution, and UV-protective capabilities in human keratinocytes. Critically, we demonstrate thatMelNPs are endocytosed, undergo perinuclear aggregation, and form a supranuclear cap, or so-called microparasol in humanepidermal keratinocytes (HEKa), mimicking the behavior of natural melananosomes in terms of cellular distribution and the factthat they serve to protect the cells from UV damage.Natural melanins are found across animal and plantkingdoms, where they perform various biological
kingdoms, where they perform various biologicalfunctions, including photoprotection, photosensitization, freeradical quenching, metal ion chelation,1and neuroprotection inthe central nervous system of humans.2,3Several types ofmelanins exist in the human body, including eumelanin,4pheomelanin,5and neuromelanin.6Eumelanin is the mostcommon, primarily determining the color of human skin. Moreimportantly, it prevents UV-induced nuclear DNA damage ofhuman skin cells by screening out harmful UV radiation.7SolarUV radiation is absorbed by DNA and damages nuclei inepidermal cells, which can lead to the formation of mutationsand subsequent, irrecoverable damage. Notably, most naturalmelanins are mixtures of eumelanins and pheomelanin withvarious ratios. Pheomelani n shows phototoxicity whencomplexed with Fe3+by stimulating UV-induced lipidperoxidation.8,9Therefore, pure, synthetic alternatives mayprovide a desirable route to repigmentation.
provide a desirable route to repigmentation.In the basal layer of the epidermis, specialized melanocytesproduce melanin-containing organelles, termed melanosomes,in which melanin is synthesized and deposited.10In skin,melanosomes are transferred from melanocytes to neighboringkeratinocytes to form perinuclear melanin caps.11,12Themelanosomes accumulate around the nuclei in the form ofmelanin caps for the mitigation of UV damage to DNA. Indeed,people are generally familiar with the process by whichexposure to UV-radiation causes melanogenesis, observed as achange in skin color commonly referred to as tanning.13Theintegrated biological system for the induction, production,transfer, and degradation of melanosomes is signi ﬁcant for thehealth of human skin, with melanin-defective diseases, such as
13Theintegrated biological system for the induction, production,transfer, and degradation of melanosomes is signi ﬁcant for thehealth of human skin, with melanin-defective diseases, such asvitiligo and albinism, highlighting the importance of theseprocesses. For example, vitiligo develops when the immunesystem wrongly attempts to clear normal melanocytes from theskin, e ﬀectively stopping the production of melanosomes.14,15Albinism is caused by genetic defects causing the failure of acopper-containing tyrosinase involved in the production ofmelanin.16,17Both diseases lack e ﬀective treatments, and theyboth promote signi ﬁcant risk of skin cancer in patients.Water-dispersible, melanin-like polydopamine nanoparticles(MelNPs) with high biocompatibility have been investigatedReceived: August 16, 2016Published: May 18, 2017Research Articlehttp://pubs.acs.org/journal/acscii© 2017 American Chemical Society 564 DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.6b00230ACS Cent.

for various biomedical applications, including as iron-chelatedT1-weighted MRI contrast agents,18and in targeted therapeuticand bioresponsive applications.19MelNPs are preparedsynthetically via the spontaneous oxidative polymerization ofdopamine under alkaline conditions in aqueous solution.20Bycontrast, biosynthetic melanins are formed in epidermalmelanocytes involving tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidative polymer-ization of tyrosine,21giving rise to black, insoluble eumela-nins.22Both synthetic and biosynthetic melanins appear toconsist of largely planar oligomeric sca ﬀolds.23MelNPs can beprepared in a variety of sizes and shapes, including spheres,18nanorods,24and hollow spheres.25,26These various morphol-ogies are prevalent in nature, such as in bird feathers, wherethey play a shape- and packing-dependent role as iridescentstructural color elements.27However, extraction of melanins
from natural sources can be problematic and potentially morecomplex than direct synthetic routes. Therefore, syntheticMelNPs have been used as models for exploring the functionand mechanism of natural eumelanins. For example, our ownwork on MelNPs has shown that synthetic forms can be used tomimic the performance of bird feathers in terms of structuralcoloration, and the materials themselves can be prepared in afacile and precisely controllable manner.28We hypothesized that synthetic MelNPs would mimicnaturally occurring melanosomes and be taken up bykeratinocytes and transported intracellularly, providing photo-protection by adopting the same kind of perinulcear melanincap in human epidermal keratinocytes as is observed for naturalmelanin. This hypothesis was predicated on two known facts.First, the process of transfer of melanosomes from melanocytesto keratinocytes can occur when these two cell types arecocultured in vitro.10,29Second, synthetic ﬂuorescent micro-
10,29Second, synthetic ﬂuorescent micro-spheres had been used to establish the role of the dynactinp150Glued subunit as a required part of the cellular machineryfor keratinocytes in which the knockout showed a lack ofmicroparasol formation.30To test our hypothesis, we ﬁrstsynthesized spherical MelNPs by spontaneous oxidization ofdopamine under alkaline conditions, introducing aqueousammonium hydroxide to an aqueous solution of monomers(Figure 1 ).31The resulting spherical MelNPs showed a narrowsize distribution around 200 nm, observed by transmissionelectron microscopy (TEM) ( Figure 1 a), scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM) ( Figure 1 b) and dynamic light scattering(DLS) ( Figure S1 ). Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) measure-ments demonstrated that the elemental composition (C, N, O)of MelNPs is consistent with natural eumelanin ( FigureS2).32,33Additionally, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) of MelNPs showed signals consistent with naturaleumelanin including carboxylic acids (1038 cm−1), hydroxyls(3225 cm−1),−CO (1617 cm−1),−CC−bond (2156cm−1), and −C−Nbond (1402 cm−1)(Figure S3 ).34Eumelanin in the condensed phase and in solution has awell-known, broad-band monotonic absorbance, including inthe ultraviolet and the visible range.35Aqueous solutions ofMelNPs appeared black in color ( Figure 1 c, inserted photo-graph) with a broad absorption in the UV −vis spectrum from250 to 850 nm, consistent with eumelanin extracted fromnatural organelles.35To gain insight into the chemical structureof the particles, the MelNPs were analyzed using MALDI-TOFmass spectrometry. The signals with high intensities revealedoligomeric structures consistent with 5,6-dihydroxyindole(DHI) and 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA)(Figure S4 ). Similar monomeric units have been observedpreviously by MALDI-MS analyses of natural sepia eumela-nin.36,37
nin.36,37Uptake of synthetic MelNPs into human epidermalkeratinocytes (HEKa) was ﬁrst examined with respect to theconcentration dependence ( Figure S5 ) and time dependence ofthe process ( Figure S6 ). Initially, MelNPs at concentrations of
keratinocytes (HEKa) was ﬁrst examined with respect to theconcentration dependence ( Figure S5 ) and time dependence ofthe process ( Figure S6 ). Initially, MelNPs at concentrations of0.4, 0.1, and 0.02 mg/mL were incubated with HEKa cells for 4h. TEM images of the cells indicated that MelNPs were takenup. However, some MelNPs tended to adhere to the cellmembrane at high concentrations (0.4 and 0.1 mg/mL).Therefore, a concentration of 0.02 mg/mL was chosen forsubsequent experiments. In a prior study, Ichihashi et al.extracted natural melanosomes from melanocytes and studiedtheir interactions with keratinocytes. It has been shown that themelanosomes are gradually degraded, leading to the melaninbeing dispersed around the nucleus of the keratinocytesasymmetrically in a process occurring over the time course of24 h.12Therefore, to test whether MelNPs showed similarbehavior, they were incubated at 0.02 mg/mL with HEKa cellsand observed at 4 h, 1 day, 2 days, and 3 days ( Figure 2 ).
MelNPs were observed as black regions under bright- ﬁeldconfocal microscopy. At 4 h, the confocal images revealedMelNPs (black) surrounding the nuclei (blue), with othersdistributed in the cytoplasm, which was consistent with TEMdata ( Figure 2 ,Figure S6, and Figure S7 ). However, after 1 dayof incubation, melanin accumulated unevenly in the perinucleararea in a manner that appears consistent with observations ofnatural melanosomes. After 3 days incubation, the MelNPsshowed clear signs of morphological transformation ( Figure 2 ,Figure S7 for 2 day data). Further, we observed thattransformed MelNPs and spherical MelNPs exist in someHEKa cells simultaneously, which may be caused by sequentialorder of uptake into cells, or the time course of processing(Figure 2 c). To examine whether these processes were inherent
to the MelNPs within keratinocytes, we incubated the particleswith mesothelial cells (MeT-5A), chosen as a control epithelialcell type distributed within tissues that do not normally take upand process melanosomes.38At the same time points, MelNPsFigure 1.

lacked any speci ﬁc traﬃcking or localization, indicating arandom distribution in the cytoplasm ( Figure S8 ). In addition,gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with a similar size and surfacecharge to the MelNPs ( Figure S9 ) were incubated with HEKacells, again showing random dispersion, rather than speci ﬁclocalization ( Figure S10 ). To test for the role of polydopaminesurface chemistry on cellular tra ﬃcking and distribution inHEKa cells, we prepared two types of core −shell nanoparticles:(1) PDA@SiO 2nanoparticles consisting of polydopamine coresand SiO2shells and (2) SiO2@PDA nanoparticles with SiO2cores and polydopamine shells. Both core −shell nanoparticlesare similar in size and surface charge to MelNPs ( Figure S11 ).Treatment of HEKa cells with SiO 2@PDA at 0.02 mg/mLresulted in similar accumulation patterns to MelNPs, withparticles appearing around the nucleus. By contrast, randomaccumulation was observed in the case of PDA@SiO 2
nanoparticles ( Figure S12 and Figure S13 ). This suggests thatthe transport process may be dependent on particle type, andthat polydopamine nanoparticle surface chemistry plays a rolein governing cellular distribution patterns.30As described in the introduction, melanosomes are tissue-speciﬁc, lysosome-related organelles of pigment cells in whichmelanins are synthesized and stored.39,40In epidermalmelanocytes, melanosomes are ultimately transported toneighboring keratinocytes, which retain the melanin while inthe basal layer and degrade as they move to the skin surface anddiﬀerentiate.41The melanosome is characterized as a lysosome-related organelle because melanin must be synthesized andpolymerized with the help of enzymes and structural proteinswithin the organelle, where acidic pH seems to be required.42,43We hypothesized that the transportation and degradation of
MelNPs were similarly driven by a lysosomal process in HEKacells. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the possiblecolocalization of lysosomes and MelNPs. We incubatedMelNPs with HEKa cells for 4 h, 1 day, and 3 days andstained for lysosomes (LysoTracker, Red DND-99, red, Figure2). Confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy images show thecolocalization of lysosome and melanin ( Figure 2 b). Therefore,MelNPs might utilize a similar pathway to natural melano-somes, undergoing lysosome-induced degradation and sub-sequent accumulation to form an arti ﬁcial perinuclear cap(evident in Figure 2 d). After 4 h of incubation, MelNPs appearas clusters in the cytosol surrounded by a membrane ( Figure2a). After 3 days, MelNPs in cells were observed by TEM,without a surrounding membrane in the cytosol and dispersedamong keratin ﬁbers ( Figure 2 c). Similar phenomena were

observed when treating keratinocytes with extracted naturalmelanosomes,12supporting our conclusion that the MelNPsperform as arti ﬁcial melanosomes utilizing the same trans-portation and degradation pathway as natural melano-somes.44,45To investigate the photoprotection capability of MelNPperinulear caps, HEKa cells, after 3 days of incubation with theparticles, were treated for 5 min with UV light andsubsequently cultured under normal conditions for 1 day.Plain HEKa cells and those incubated with SiO2@PDA core −shell nanoparticles, PDA@SiO2core−shell nanoparticles, andAuNPs showed dramatically decreased viabilities after UVirradiation. However, HEKa cells incubated with MelNPsdisplayed signi ﬁcantly higher viability than other groups, at50%. That is, UV is still detrimental to the cells, but to adecreased level in the presence of MelNPs ( Figure 3 ).Furthermore, considering the fact that UV exposure leads to
the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting incell death,46,47we next assayed for ROS occurring in responseto UV irradiation, in the presence of the various nanoparticlesdescribed above. Here, we used 2 ′,7′-dichloro ﬂuorescindiacetate (DCFH-DA) as a marker, which exhibits greenﬂuorescence under ROS activation.48Following UV irradiation,the level of green ﬂuoresence in untreated HEKa cells is clearlyhigher than with MelNP treatment, con ﬁrming the protectivequalities provided by arti ﬁcial perinuclear cap formation.Moreover, HEKa cells incubated with PDA@SiO2core−shellnanoparticles and AuNPs respectively displayed signi ﬁcantincreases in ROS-related green ﬂuorescence. In turn, cellsincubated with SiO 2@PDA core −shell nanoparticles showedlow levels of green ﬂuorescence similar to MelNPs, an e ﬀect
potentially due to their surface exposed polydopamine.Controls without UV irradiation, with all types of nanoparticles,showed low to undetectable levels of green ﬂuorescence(Figure 4 ,Figure S14 ). These data imply that ROS can bedecreased utilizing particles that deposit polydopamine intra-cellularly. However, viability assays indicate that only MelNPsprovide actual protection. Therefore, we endeavored toexamine DNA damage directly.DNA damage is the predominant deleterious e ﬀect of UVradiation on cells. UV radiation induces two of the mostabundant mutagenic and cytotoxic DNA lesions known:cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts(6-4PPs) and their Dewar valence isomers.7,49,50Therefore, wetested for protective qualities of MelNPs by analyzing DNAdamage in HEKa cells after treatment with MelNPs followed byUV irradiation ( Figure 5 ). In mammalian cells, damage togenomic DNA can be lethal, inducing the formation ofphosphorylated H2AX.
51In our study, DNA damage wasdetected using a red ﬂuorescent antibody (Alexa Fluor 555)against phosphorylated H2AX. At the same time, cell viabilitywas investigated by Image-iT DEAD Green, which permeateswhen the plasma membrane is compromised. The results showthat HEKa cells su ﬀering this treatment had dramaticallyincreased DNA damage (red) and cell death (green), seensimultaneously (see magni ﬁed images in Figure S15 ). Bycontrast, after incubating with MelNPs for 3 days, HEKa cellswith 5 min UV irradiation and subsequent 24 h incubationdisplayed less DNA damage ( Figure 5 ). In addition, weconﬁrmed that there was no heat generation in MelNPssolutions after UV irradiation ( Figure S16 ). Therefore, thesupranuclear arti ﬁcial melanin caps reduce damage fromultraviolet light in HEKa cells, similar to the performance ofnatural supranuclear melanin caps.52In conclusion, we prepared melanin-like nanoparticles(MelNPs) by spontaneous oxidation of dopamine in alkaline
solution to investigate their potential as mimics of melano-somes. MelNPs were taken up by HEKa cells, followed byaccumulation in patterns typical of so-called microparasols orperinuclear caps. This cellular distribution pattern is similar to

that observed for natural melanosomes occurring in human skinin vivo12observed in tissue culture of keratinocytes treated withextracted melanosomes,39and in cocultures of melanocyteswith keratinocytes.29We demonstrated the UV photoprotectivequalities of synthetic MelNPs, as predominantly arising fromthe prevention of DNA damage. Considering limitations in thetreatment of melanin-defective related diseases and thebiocompatibility of these synthetic MelNPs in terms of uptakeand degradation, these systems have potential as arti ﬁcialmelanosomes for the development of novel therapies, possiblysupplementing the biological functions of natural melanins.■ASSOCIATED CONTENT*SSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on theACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.6b00230 .Synthetic methods, materials characterization, and nano-particles analysis in cells ( PDF)■AUTHOR INFORMATIONCorresponding Author*E-mail: ngianneschi@ucsd.edu .ORCID
