Initially
viewed as cellular garbage with no biological functions, exosomes are now recognized for their therapeutic potential and used in regenerative medicine. Cell-derived exosomes are released into almost all biological fluids, making them abundant and accessible vesicles for a variety of diseases. These naturally occurring nanoparticles have a wide range of applications including drug delivery and regenerative medicine. Exosomes sourced from a specific tissue have been proven to provide greater therapeutic effects to their native tissue, expanding exosome sources beyond traditional cell lines such as mesenchymal stem cells. However, standardizing production and passing regulations remain obstacles, due to variations in methods and quantification techniques across studies. Additionally, obtaining pure exosomes at sufficient quantities remains difficult due to the heterogeneity of exosomes. In this review, we will underline the uses of
exosomes as a therapy and their roles in lung regenerative medicine, as well as current chal-lenges in exosome therapies.ARTICLE HISTORYReceived 16 July 2019  Revised 10 June 2020  Accepted 11 June 2020  KEYWORDSExosome; regenerative medicine; lung spheroid cell; stem cellIntroductionExosomes are a type of extracellular vesicle (EV) whose diameter ranges from 30 to 100 nm and are character-ized by a cup-shaped morphology. They originate from multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and are released into the extracellular space following plasma membrane fusion. Exosomes carry cargo composed of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids to recipient cells, which take up the cargo and initiate a response [ 1]. These EVs can target cells through ligand-receptor mediated interactions, membrane infusion, and endocytosis. Exosomes and their components have the ability to influence the tissue microenvironment to mediate cellular commu-nication through local and distal alterations of extra-
cellular matrix [ 2,3]. Exosomes can be classified through immunolabeling, by identifying exosomal sur-face proteins that include tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, and CD81), integrins (ITG), cell adhesion molecules (CAM), and growth factor receptors [ 4,5]. Variations in proteins and receptors on the exosome surface allow for targeting to recipient cells, enabling exosomes to be utilized as a tissue-specific delivery vehicle [ 6]. Although exosome characterization has been further elucidated, as scientific articles continue to be pub-lished regarding extracellular vesicles as a whole, the Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (MISEV) provides guidelines to ensure stan-dardized characterization, isolation, and purification of particular EVs [ 7]. With consideration of the MISEV, exosome production and characterization can be more replicable, resulting in more reproducible data across studies.Exosomes as drug delivery vehicles

ability to target and carry out a tissue-specific response by controlling the RNAs, proteins, and lipids contained within the exosome [ 9]. To optimize targeting effi-ciency and retention, exosomes can be engineered by manipulation of specific cargo loading and surface decorating or “cloaking”, such as in the fabrication of artificial chimeric exosomes [ 10–13]. Bio-engineered exosomes can allow for in vitro and in vivo traceability, cellular response initiation, and increased cellular uptake through surface charge modifications [ 13,14]. However, these manipulations reduce clinical translat-ability, by altering the exosome’s natural state. Three main strategies have been developed for exosome drug delivery: isolating naïve exosomes and loading into drug-incorporated cells, loading drugs into parental cells which then release exosomes, and transfecting parental cells with DNA-encoding drugs which then release exosomes [ 15]. These strategies have clinical
applications but remain difficult to scale up to human patients, due to time-intensive and costly production [15]. Currently, there are only two ongoing Phase I clinical trials using exosomes as drug delivery vehicles (Table 1). Under the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, mesenchymal stromal cell-derived exosomes loaded with small interference RNA against KrasG12D, coined “iExosomes”, are being used to treat participants with pancreatic cancer with a KrasG12D mutation ( https:// clinicaltrials.gov , NCT 03608631). Under the James Graham Brown Cancer Center, the effects of curcu-min-conjugated plant exosomes are being evaluated in patients undergoing surgery for newly diagnosed colon cancer (https://clinicaltrials.gov , NCT 01294072). It is evident that exosomal cargo loading and surface dec-orating are effective therapeutic strategies with clinical applications. As exosome sourcing is refined, their targeting and retentive abilities will be optimized, mak-
ing exosomes a more feasible nanotechnology.Exosomes for regenerative medicineExosomes are already a feasible therapy for tissue regen-eration across all major organs. Selectivity based on par-ent cell type and exosomal cargo loading increases therapeutic outcomes and specificity while minimizing adverse effects. Exosomes have demonstrated regenera-tive properties by reducing inflammation and apoptosis while promoting proliferation and angiogenesis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived exo-somes are popular in regenerative medicine, due to their multipotency and self-renewing properties. This multi-potency provides therapeutic benefits to many organ and tissue types. For example, exosomes are able to combat cardiovascular disease, promote bone remodelling, and regress liver fibrosis, despite vast differences across dis-ease models [ 16–18]. Exosomes have also shown promis-ing regenerative effects in a wide variety of models, such
as myocardial infarction, kidney injury, and neurological injury. Injection of MSC-exosomes has been shown to reduce infarct size in a rat myocardial infarction model, while restoring long-term cardiac function [ 19]. Human cardiosphere-derived exosomes have shown greater glo-bal heart function than media controls in an acute MI mouse model [ 20]. Hypoxic cardiac progenitor cell- derived exosomes improve cardiac function, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and hypertrophy in a rat model of ischae-mia reperfusion [ 21,22]. Exosomal microRNA miR-21- 5p helps regulate apoptosis and angiogenesis and improves heart function in a mouse model of myocardial infarction [ 23]. Exosome-mediated delivery of Sonic hedgehog protein improves therapeutic efficacy of human CD34+ stem cells in a mouse model of acute myocardial infarction [ 24]. Engineered hydrogel patches loaded with induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardi-omyocyte EVs offer a slowly released cell-free therapeutic

loaded with induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardi-omyocyte EVs offer a slowly released cell-free therapeutic that reduces infarct size and cell hypertrophy in a rat model of acute myocardial infarction [ 25]. Delivery of MSC-exosomes overexpressing miR-let7 c targets and reverses kidney fibrosis in a murine unilateral ureteral obstruction model [B. 26]. Exosomes secreted from hypoxic rat renal proximal tubular cells are protective against renal tubular cell injury [ 27]. Additionally, human kidney tubular cells and their secreted exosomes prevent renal injury in a rat model of bilateral renal ischaemia [ 28]. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells with overexpressed miR-181-5p provide targeted therapy to hepatic stellate cells and attenuate liver injury in the mouse model of liver fibrosis [ 29]. Modified exo-somes can effectively deliver miR-124, bypassing the blood-brain barrier and inducing neurogenesis following
ischaemic injury in a murine photothrombosis model [30,31]. Human neural stem cell-derived EVs have a neuroprotective effect, leading to significant improve-ments at the tissue and function level of both mouse models of thromboembolic stroke and pig models of ischaemic stroke [ 32,33]. It is evident that exosome- mediated tissue regeneration has potential, as exosomes and their secreted factors have both shown improvement in tissue regeneration. MSC-secreted bioactive molecules have also been shown to exert paracrine effects on sur-rounding cells in the tissue microenvironment, providing therapeutic benefits [ 34,35]. This indicates that both MSC-exosomes and their secreted factors contribute to tissue regeneration. Exosome secretome can be manipu-lated to improve its therapeutic effects through cellular pre-conditioning [ 35].

allow for more specialized and effective exosome target-ing and regeneration, increasing clinical translatability. Currently, there are numerous clinical trials using exo-somes for regenerative medicine, ranging from cutaneous wound healing to macular hole regeneration ( Table 1). Under Kumamoto University, serum-derived exosomes are being used to accelerate cutaneous wound healing in patients with intractable cutaneous ulcers ( https://clinical trials.gov, NCT 02565264). Under Tianjin Medical University, mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes are being used to promote healing of large and refractory macular holes (MHs) in patients diagnosed with large and long-standing idiopathic MHs ( https://clinicaltrials. gov, NCT 03437759). Exosome use for regenerative med-icine is a feasible therapeutic, offering practical applica-tions for a wide range of diseases.Lung regenerative medicineMesenchymal stem cellsMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are among the most
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are among the most popular stem cell types in research, due to their differ-ential potential and ability to maintain tissue homo-eostasis [ 36]. MSCs can be obtained from multiple sources, such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, periph-eral blood, placenta, and umbilical cord. The use of MSCs in clinical trials continues to expand each year, with over 900 studies listed in ClinicalTrails.gov and over 50 for the use of MSCs for lung diseases specifi-cally (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov). The trials focus on a range of lung diseases including acute lung injury, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, acute respiratory dis-tress syndrome, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, demonstrating that MSCs can be used to treat a wide spectrum of diseases, even within a particular organ. Yi et al. found that overexpressing miR-30b-3p in MSC- derived exosomes helped relieve inflammation and repair alveolar epithelial cells in a mouse model of
acute lung injury [37]. Systemic administration of MSCs to two patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome alleviated respiratory, haemodynamic, and multiorgan failure [ 38]. Intranasal delivery of MSCs helped attenuate lung injury in a neonatal rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia [ 39]. MSCs and MSC- derived exosomes are clearly effective biological ther-apeutics for lung regenerative medicine. Small-scale clinical studies show promising results for MSCs in their early stages, giving hope for future acellular exo-some clinical applications. Transitioning from stem cell therapies to their acellular exosomes will help over-come current obstacles of low cellular engraftment and stability in the lung, making MSC-derived exo-somes an attractive alternative [ 40]. Despite these Table 1. Clinical applications of exosomes in drug delivery and regenerative medicine.Drug delivery Regenerative medicine

advances over the past several years, challenges such as batch consistency and purity remain when transition-ing from rodent models of lung disease to large-scale clinical trials [ 41]. Nevertheless, MSC-exosomes offer an alternative to cellular therapies that may provide similar regenerative abilities, devoid of adverse effects following cellular administration.MSC-exosomes carry a unique and diverse group of nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids that have yet to be identified to reside in one or multiple types of exo-somes (Figure 2) [36]. This array of cargo elicits a diverse range of cellular responses to provide thera-peutic benefits for various diseases but may require higher specificity to provide superior tissue regenera-tion and homoeostasis for organs like the lung [ 36]. Although MSCs and MSC-exosomes are popular bio-logical agents in lung regenerative medicine, elucidat-ing their cargo and developing consistent batches
would help unveil key targets for specific lung diseases.Lung progenitor and spheroid cellsLung progenitor cells (LPCs) prove to be popular cell types for lineage tracing and differentiation studies, reg-ulatory studies in cancer models, and lung regenerative medicine [ 42–44]. As opposed to MSCs, lung progenitor cells are a more intrinsic stem cell type and better facil-itate lung cell regeneration after injury, offering greater potential targeting and retention abilities [ 45]. Our lab has developed a heterogeneous lung cell line from healthy human whole-lung and transbronchial biopsies, that con-sists of a lung progenitor cell core supported by a surrounding layer of stromal cells [ 40]. The lung pro-genitor cell core, positive for alveolar type II cells (ProSPC+) and secretory cells (CCSP+), is formed when cells outgrow from lung tissue explants and aggregate into three-dimensional lung spheroids when seeded
onto ultra-low-attachment flasks [ 45]. Supported by stro-mal-like cells, positive for CD90 and CD105, the progeni-tor core significantly increases stemness when assuming a 3D structure [ 40]. This three-dimensional culturing technique may also enhance stemness by more closely mimicking an in vivo stem cell niche. These spheroids can reactivate the plasticity of differentiated lung cells upon disease or injury and have greater therapeutic tar-geting to the lung than traditional adherent mesenchymal stem cells [ 45–47]. When plated on an adherent surface, lung progenitor cells can dissociate from their three- dimensional spheroid shape to a monolayer of cells we termed “lung spheroid cells” (LSCs) ( Figure 1). LSCs maintain a similar phenotype to lung progenitor cells but may differentiate into mature lung cells, indicated by an increase in Epcam+ expression [ 40]. LPC and LSC expansion and conditioning can provide novel exo-
somes and exosome-secretome that may elicit a greater regenerative effect to the lungs than traditionally used MSCs. Such intrinsically sourced cell therapy can eluci-date therapeutic targets and pathways that current cell models cannot achieve.The effect of adult human stem cells, such as our LSCs, is superior to multipotent stem cells for the treatment of lung-specific diseases by providing a more specialized tis-sue microenvironment [ 40]. Although a heterogeneous lung cell population, allogeneic LSCs can alleviate inflam-mation, minimize immunological response, and slow fibrotic development through paracrine mechanisms and direction regeneration in both mouse and rat models of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, in a superior fash-ion to MSCs ( Figure 2) [40,48]. LSCs are retained for several weeks in the lungs of mouse and rat models of pulmonary fibrosis, providing prolonged cellular therapy to target diseased tissues [ 40,48]. Additionally, major

organs including the lung heart, liver, kidneys, and spleen are devoid of tumour formation in both mouse and rat models [40,48]. Mice who received LSCs had less fibrotic thickening and tissue infiltration than mice who received adipose-derived MSCs [ 45]. Additionally, administration of LSC-derived exosomes yields therapeutic effects in a pulmonary fibrosis mouse model, providing a cell-free alternative [ 49]. LSC-derived exosomes decrease fibrosis and attenuate the alveolar epithelium and vasculature, making exosomes and their unique array of cargo a potential target for cell-free therapy [ 49]. This intrinsic source of stem cells has the ability to treat a variety of pulmonary diseases and is not limited to fibrosis models, making LSCs and LSC-derived exosomes noteworthy cel-lular therapies in regenerative medicine. Similar strategies using cardiosphere derivation and cardiosphere-derived exosomes are also implemented in models of ischaemic
heart failure and myocardial infarction. Allogeneic cardio-sphere-derived cells (CDCs) extracted and isolated from human myocardium have promising preclinical and clin-ical results, triggering native cardiomyocyte proliferation and recruiting endogenous progenitor cells [ 50]. CDCs have been utilized in several clinical trials, including the CADUCEUS and DYNAMIC trials [ 51,52]. A decrease in intramyocardial scarring and minimization of adverse remodelling has also been demonstrated in a pig model of acute and convalescent myocardial infarction treated with CDC-exosomes, demonstrating clinical potential for a cell-free alternative [ 53].3D culturing of intrinsically sourced stem cells into spheroids is a promising cellular therapy for a wide variety of diseases beyond the heart and lungs. Studies should expand beyond traditional mesenchymal cell sources, to elicit greater therapeutic effects and enhance cellular targeting and retention.Challenges in exosome therapy
Exosome production, expansion, and delivery remain prominent challenges in regenerative medicine. As purification and production continue to improve, exo-somes in regenerative medicine will become more tar-geted and tissue-specific. However, further research needs to be conducted to fully understand the complete contents of exosomes, methods of tissue targeting, impact on targeted tissues, and long-term safety effects [54]. Overall, standardizing the production of exo-somes will improve consistency, dosage, and potency in the translational medicine community.Isolation and purification of exosomesIsolation and purification of exosomes remains imper-fect and difficult to produce in large scales for clinical applications. Although considered the current optimal method for exosome isolation, ultracentrifugation- based isolation techniques suffer from contamination and exosome loss due to the heterogeneous nature of exosomes [ 55]. Despite these drawbacks, ultracentrifu-
gation remains a popular isolation technique because it is easy and relatively cheap. Two common types of ultracentrifugation are differential and density gradient ultracentrifugation. In differential ultracentrifugation, a series of centrifugation cycles isolate sample compo-nents by size, with forces ranging around ~100,000 x g. These cycles are used to separate exosomes from unwanted components, such as apoptotic cells and cell debris. In density gradient ultracentrifugation, samples are separated through centrifugation in a density gradient medium. This creates defined solute zones of specific densities [ 55]. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of exosomes, these isolation tech-niques cannot perfectly differentiate exosomes from all other unwanted components; overlaps in cell size and density across exosome samples hinders current isola-tion techniques. Immunoaffinity capture-based techni-ques have also been developed to isolate exosomes
density across exosome samples hinders current isola-tion techniques. Immunoaffinity capture-based techni-ques have also been developed to isolate exosomes using exosome-specific surface markers, such as CD63 [10]. This technique provides highly specific and pure isolation, but is costly and is hindered by the lack of exosome-specific surface markers. A possible solution to improve isolation and purification of exosomes is to combine ultracentrifugation with immunoaffinity cap-ture techniques, using surface markers that specifically target exosomes from the sample undergoing such iso-lation and purification. An additional solution involves implementing higher resolution density gradients when undergoing ultracentrifugation. Higher resolution Figure 2. Comparison of exosomal cargo between lung spher-oid cell- and mesenchymal cell-derived exosomes [ 49].JOURNAL OF EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES 5

density gradients are necessary to produce more pure exosome fractions and gain a better understanding of exosome composition [ 56]. Jeppesen et al. employed a combination isolation technique by using density gradient fractionation to separate extracellular vesicles from non-vesicular material, along with direct immu-noaffinity capture to specifically isolate exosomes [ 56]. This combination successfully separated exosomes for other heterogenous sample matter, allowing for more accurate and specific identification and analysis of exo-somal properties. Chemical-based isolation techniques isolate highly purified exosome populations and are available as commercial kits, but risk composition alteration and chemical retention in exosome samples [57]. Commercial kits for polymer precipitation have also been developed to overcome these disadvantages, by using solutions of superhydrophilic polymers for isolation. However, these kits are expensive and not
suitable for large sample sizes. Additionally, EV type cannot be differentiated, making biomarker elucidation difficult [ 57]. Microfluidic devices have gained popu-larity for EV isolation, by trapping vesicles of defined diameter into nanofilters [ 58]. Although this allows for isolation customization, complex fabrication of the device along with low recovery rates makes microflui-dic devices hard to translate to clinical settings [ 58]. Because of the heterogeneous nature of exosomes, opti-mal isolation strategies vary with each sample. Although many exosomes types contain similar surface markers (CD9, CD81, and CD63) that can be targeted for affinity-based purification, chemical alterations and low yields may outweigh the benefits of such pure isolation. A combination of isolation techniques opti-mized for particular exosome samples will allow for proper sample selection while maintaining clinically relevant yields. Overall, as the characteristics and sur-
face phenotypes of tissue-specific exosomes become more defined, isolation and purification techniques will improve and become more clinically translatable.Large-scale production and immortalizationTranslation to large-scale production of exosomes for clinical trials remains difficult, as traditional cell cul-ture is inefficient in terms of time and cost. Production will be optimized once the ideal exosomal microenvir-onment is identified in an in vitro system [ 59]. Currently, 2D culture techniques remain common means of production, but they are labour-intensive and result in low exosome yield. Transitioning to 3D culturing techniques increases efficiency, but still does not meet the demands for clinical application, which requires significantly more cells for treatment than traditional animal models. Bioreactors and microcar-riers provide large-scale expansion methods, by max-imizing surface area for stem cell and exosome growth
[60]. Exosome yields can be increased ~40-fold through bioreactor culture, in comparison to conven-tional cell culture [ 61]. Although requiring more media and more frequent passaging, these larger-scale meth-ods maximize surface area and allow for efficient cell expansion, all without comprising cellular function. However, exosome isolation in large-scale applications remains impractical, with structural damage and batch inconsistencies hindering clinical translation. Although solutions such as higher resolution density gradients would help produce purer batches, they are not a feasible approach for large-scale production and GMP standards, due to discrepancies in successful iso-lation and retained quality [ 62]. Systems such as tan-gential flow filtration (TFF) have been developed to combat such limitations, assuring more efficient exo-some yields and decreased vesicular damage [ 63]. By directing liquid suspension flow tangentially, as
opposed to dead-end, filter clogging by larger particles
some yields and decreased vesicular damage [ 63]. By directing liquid suspension flow tangentially, as opposed to dead-end, filter clogging by larger particles is minimized and particles are separated more effi-ciently. This redirection yields higher concentrations of isolated exosomes from the same sample, making TFF desirable for large-scale production. Cell line immortalization can also produce higher yields and ensure infinite supply. Because some stem cell lines, such as our LSCs, have only a finite number of cell divisions before they senesce, discovery of immortali-zation agents for these specific cell types will allow infinite cell division and safer expansion. Chen et al. implemented this strategy by immortalizing MSCs through transfection of lentivirus carrying the MYC gene [64]. This transfection was a practical strategy that not only ensured an infinite supply of cells and exosomes but also increased proliferative rates [ 64].
Although immortalization generates large genomic and proteomic outputs, gene expression is manipulated and may no longer represent its native stem character-istics [65]. Stem cell marker expression must be vali-dated upon each passage, to ensure cell characteristics and functions do not deviate among generations. Large-scale exosome production will be optimized through a combination of advanced culturing and iso-lation techniques. Because of the heterogeneous nature of cell types and their secreted exosomes, no one com-bination of large-scale production and exosome isola-tion is optimal for all cell types. An individual evaluation of the risk factors associated with the trans-lation to large-scale production and cellular immorta-lization must be taken before achieving a clinically relevant product.6K.

Dosage and potencyStandardization of exosome dosage and potency needs to be implemented but is difficult due to the heterogeneous nature of exosomes across various progenitor cells, varia-tions in animal models, and differences in cellular char-acteristics and evaluation. Therefore, extrapolating exosome dosage from animal models to humans also requires careful consideration. Inconsistencies in dosage methods and potency quantifications make it difficult to reference and exchange data across studies and clinical trials [66]. Since exosome characteristics also vary among cell types, standards may be more effectively formed when considering the tissue being targeted and the mechanisms by which the exosomes reach the target tissue. An in-depth evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacody-namics of exosomes across various tissue sources will help elucidate optimal dosage and catalyse regulatory approval. The biodistribution and cellular uptake of exo-
somes need to be identified, to further investigate exosomal half-life, off-target organ accumulation, and surface mod-ification to minimize non-target cell interactions [ 67]. Standardization will allow for more comparable results and will increase consistency across batches [ 68].Regulatory hurdlesFDA approval processes pose as obstacles in translating exosomes to clinical trials. Many commercial companies have emerged, producing products and therapies that uti-lize exosomes, with Aegle Therapeutics being a noteworthy company to receive IND clearance from the FDA ( Table 2). However, the heterogenetic nature of exosomes between batches, cell sources, and purification techniques compli-cates the approval of such biological products by impeding reproducibility. With the FDA’s definition of biological products continuing to be revised, it is difficult to interpret and fit within these standards. In addition, extensive testing
on exosome stability, sterility, quality, and potency must be measured and maintained during processing and shipping conditions. The effects of such processing are not well known and may result in exosome content or composition variations during each processing step. As guidelines for exosome therapeutics are developed specifically to aid in manufacturing and validation during each processing step, exosomes will become easier biological products to approve.Exosome-based biomarker developmentCurrently, there are FDA-approved diagnostic tests that utilize exosome collections from liquid biopsies, such as blood and urine [ 69]. In such minimally invasive diagnostic tests, unique exosomal surface antigens and cargo are tar-geted and serve as precise biomarkers for disease diagnosis [70]. Disease evolution can also be evaluated through exo-some concentration, proving exosomal-based liquid biopsy to be a powerful tool for cancer metastasis or disease
progression [ 70,71]. However, improvements need to be made to increase sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy in other disease models to expand FDA approval outward from liquid biopsies [ 72]. From a clinical standpoint, Exosome Diagnostics offers cutting-edge technology that utilizes patient-derived exosomes for biomarker discovery, RNA analysis, mutation detection, protein detection, and signal enhancement through their approved productions: Exolution RNATM, Exolution PlusTM, and EDDETM (Table 2). From a research standpoint, atherosclerosis diagnosis through circulating microRNAs in blood is a promising diagnostic tool, but still targets eight microRNAs, whose expression levels vary as atherosclerosis manifests [ 73]. Although early detection would significantly improve patient outcome, since clinical signs may take years to develop, identifying a single or combination of microRNAs that are sensitive and precise at the right con-
centration would be crucial for FDA approval [ 73]. Translating exosomes to a clinical setting is feasible, but
microRNAs that are sensitive and precise at the right con-centration would be crucial for FDA approval [ 73]. Translating exosomes to a clinical setting is feasible, but refining biomarker selection for diagnosis is imperative for FDA approval.Exosome therapeuticsExosomes pose as a cell-free alternative to cellular therapies but continue to face challenges when translating to clinical studies. Although the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of exosomes from xenogeneic and allogenic sources have not been fully characterized, numerous preclinical studies have made such evaluations in cellular therapies. With studies showing disease improvement in both allogeneic and autologous treatments, it is promising that pre-clinical studies using exosomes from such cellular sources would better overcome regulatory hurdles when translated to a clinical setting [ 48,74,75]. Since some exosome studies have shown unaffected differentially expressed genes
related to inflammation or toxicity, as well as no visual signs of toxicity after repeated administration, exosome therapies show promise [ 76,77]. However, the efficacy of such treatments is more difficult to validate, as disease outcomes following exosome therapeutics may vary between patients due to product variations. Federal regula-tion of exosome therapies will help improve consistency by implementing standardized data collection, product- tracing information, dosage levels, and potency quantifica-tion. These regulations would help facilitate data exchange across studies and disease models. Exosome therapy has JOURNAL OF EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES 7

great potential and FDA approval will catalyse clinical trials for translational medicine.ConclusionExosomes have great potential to treat a wide variety of diseases. Secreted by many cell types and into almost all biological fluids, exosomes harness the great potential for biological therapies. Drug delivery and regenerative medi-cine are just some of the many applications. Through bio- engineering techniques such as cargo loading and surface modifications, exosomes can be enhanced to deliver super-ior therapeutic components at greater concentrations to targeted cell types. Exosomes in regenerative medicine continue to improve across all major organs and tissues, as parent cell selection enhances cargo specificity, void of adverse immune responses or rejection seen in cellular therapies. Intrinsic sources of exosomes further facilitate these enhancements, expanding sourcing from traditional multipotent cell lines to cells derived from the target tissue.
Nevertheless, new manufacturing techniques need to be developed and regulated to perfect exosome production, expansion, and delivery. Isolation and purification will be improved as separation is perfected through an optimal combination of techniques. Large-scale production of exosomes will meet demands as culturing techniques tran-sition from standard 2D practices, to 3D culturing techni-ques and bioreactors. Immortalization of stem cell lines will also ensure infinite expansion, but at the cost of cell manip-ulation. Standardization of exosome dosage and potency across studies and trials will improve data exchange and consistency with help through federal approval and regula-tion. Even with production optimizing, exosomes will con-tinue to face challenges in clinical translation, with federal guidelines and requirements continuing to change and become more stringent. As the heterogeneous nature of exosomes is further elucidated, exosomes will become
more reproducible and easier to translate. Exosomes cur-rently harness the great potential for biological therapies and will continue to improve as current challenges are met.Disclosure of interestK.C. is an equity holder of BreStem Therapeutics.
