Interest in protection against solar ultraviolet radiation UVR among the general public in Australia has been increasing
steadily as a result of the `SunSmart' campaigns run by the various state cancer councils. This increasing awareness is due inpart to the requirements for occupational protection of outdoor workers and to provision of UVR protection for therecreational market. Behaviour outdoors can significantly affect exposure to solar UVR and use of items of personalprotection can provide a substantial reduction in the UVR dose received. The protective properties of sunscreens, sunglasses,hats and clothing against UVR have been the subject of considerable research for some time, and over the last few yearsinterest has extended to the provision of shade structures and the UVR protection provided by various commonly usedmaterials. These materials include shadecloth, plastics, glass, windscreens and applicable tints.

has increased substantially as a result of educationalcampaigns such as `SunSmart' run by the Australianstate cancer councils. The long term aim of thesecampaigns is to reduce the very high incidence ofskin cancer and melanoma in Australia by reducingthe population's solar UVR exposure. People havebegun to take positive steps to protect themselvesagainst ambient solar UVR by measures which in-clude changing behaviour and wearing appropriateclothing, sunglasses and sunscreens when outdoors.Although recreational exposures account for most ofthe significant UVR exposures of a large proportionof the population, the UVR exposures of outdoorworkers in occupational situations has generated in-creasing interest among workers, trade unions andemployer organisations. This has certainly been thecase since the National Health and Medical ResearchCouncil of Australia adopted the exposure guidelinesof the International Radiation Protection Association
. wx IRPA 1989 6 for UVR as an exposure standard. wx NHMRC 1989 7 . The Australian Council of Trade.Unions ACTU and the Victorian Trades Hall.Council VTHC issued an occupational health andwx safety standard on UVR hazards in 1989 8.ACTU rVTHC 1989 . Larger employer organisa- tions now regularly provide protective items hats,sunscreens, sunglasses and more recently, rated.clothing to their outdoor workers.1.1. Ambient solar UVRAustralia has high levels of solar UVR in compar-
Australia has high levels of solar UVR in compar-ison with Europe and North America, due mainly toits geographical position, with most of Australiacloser to the equator than all of Europe. Duringsummer in Australia, the earth's ellipticalorbit bringsit closer to the sun than during the northern summer,resulting in 7% additional intensity of solar UVR.This, coupled with clearer atmospheric conditionsand the more significant ozone depletion observedover the Antarctic, may result in a measured ambientUVR which is 12 to 15% higher for geographicallocations in the southern hemisphere than it is atwx comparable locations in the northern hemisphere 9 .Australia has a significant problem with solar
Australia has a significant problem with solarUVR, as evidenced by the fact that it has the highestskin cancer rates in the world. No increases in thelevels of solar UVR at the earth's surface due toozone depletion are needed to exacerbate what isalready a major problem. Measurements of the ambi-ent levels of biologically effective solar UVR. wx UVReff fromtheAustraliannetwork 10 areshownin Fig. 1 in comparison with some other publishedwxdata 11¬±14 . Cloud cover variations from year toyear result in a 10% variation in the measured yearlytotal UVReff. Given that ozone depletion is of theorder of 3% per decade at mid-latitudes, it is unlikelythat long-term ozone depletion effects on the mea-sured UV levels will be observed for many yearswx15 . Fig. 1 shows a clearly evident latitude gradient,and indicates that the levels for Australia are veryhigh. Levels of skin cancer are also very high andwx the variation with latitude is shown in Fig. 1 16 .
The magnitude of the problem is evident from thefact that in 1988, 1019 people died of skin cancer inAustralia; of these deaths, 784 could be attributed tomelanoma and the majority of the rest to squamous. cell carcinoma SCC . The non-melanoma skin can-.cer NMSC incidence rate was 850 r100,000, whichmeans that each year there are 140,000 new caseswx16 . The rates of NMSC increase as latitude de-.creases Table 1 and as solar UVR levels increase.Fig. 1.

Personal exposure to solar UVRNot only is it important to know what the levelsof ambient solar UVR are, but it is also important toknow how much of this ambient UVR people areexposed to. A number of personal exposure studiesw using polysulphone film have been undertaken 17¬±x20 to try to quantify human solar UVR exposures.wx These include recreational exposure activities 18,19as well as occupational exposures of outdoor work-wxers 18,19 . The anatomical distributions of solar
UVR exposures depend upon the activity undertakenas well as the surroundings. Generally, males havegreater UVR exposures than females, indicating thatbehaviour is also an important factor in determiningexposure. Outdoor workers and people undertakingrecreational activities can receive 10 to 20% of thedaily total ambient UVR and up to 30 to 40%wx18¬±20 of available ambient UVR, for the timeperiod they are outside. Consequently, body sites notcovered by clothing need to be protected in some.way hats, sunscreens , since in Australia aroundwx wx noon in summer the IRPA 6 and NHMRC 7guidelines will be exceeded in approximately 10 to12 min.2. Protection against solar UVRFull use of all elements of UVR protection, in-
Full use of all elements of UVR protection, in-cluding behaviour, environment, legislation and mostimportantly, personal protection, can reduce an indi-vidual's solar UVR exposure to between 1 and 10%of that without any protection. It is therefore possibleto more than compensate for any increases in solarUVR which may eventuate due to ozone depletion,and hopefully to significantly reduce the exposuresof the population if the awareness and attitudinalchanges required can be brought about.2.1. Beha Àùioural changesBehavioural changes, such as avoiding the sun,
Behavioural changes, such as avoiding the sun,can play a very important role in the reduction of anindividual's total UVR exposure. Since 70% of thedaily total biologically effective solar UVR occurswithin 3 h either side of noon, scheduling of outdooractivities at other times outside of these hours willsignificantly reduce an individual's total UVR expo-sure. If people must undertake outdoor activities,then provision of shade and subsequent reduction insolar UVR exposure should be a high priority.2.2. Legislati Àùe and enÀùironmental changesChanging the environment, by the provision ofshade and other UVR protective structures can helpto reduce human UVR exposures considerably. Manyschools around Australia, especially in Queensland,are providing shade or shade structures for theirstudents during recess and lunch breaks. A numberwx of policy documents have been released 21¬±23
wx of policy documents have been released 21¬±23covering the provision of shade. One motive forthese moves is the avoidance of potential legal com-pensation claims in the future, since organisationssuch as schools and employers may be held responsi-ble for providing a non-hazardous environment fortheir students or employees. Protection can also in-volve legislation, which can insist on the use ofitems of personal protection. Primary schools areadoptingthe rule that studentswithout hats are barredfrom playing in the schoolgrounds at recess andlunch times. This helps reduce the avenues of expo-sure to solar UVR. Provision of shade structures hasalso generated interest in the amount of UVR protec-tion provided by shadecloth and roofing and con-wx struction plastics 24 . Many people are also havingtheir car windscreens and side windows tinted andthe amount of protection provided by various auto-wx glass materials and tints has been determined 25 .2.3. Personal protection
2.3. Personal protectionOften it is not possible to schedule the time spentoutdoors or choose shaded positions, in which casepersonal protection against solar UVR is the onlyoption. Such protection should be considered as the
() P.H. Gies et al. rMutation Research 422 1998 15¬±22 18last line of defence, and may include the use of hats,sunglasses, sunscreens and clothing.

Wearing a hat with a 5 cm brim willwx reduce the UVR dose at all facial sites 26 , whilewx sunglasses reduce the ocular dose 27 . The applica-tion of an SPF 15 qsunscreen to all exposed areas
tion of an SPF 15 qsunscreen to all exposed areasof skin as well as wearing a hat, good qualitysunglasses and well-designed clothing, should allprovide very significant amounts of protection. Edu-cational campaigns attempt to minimise solar UVRexposure and thus the long-term risk of skin cancer.These have resulted in greater use of items of per-sonal protection against solar UVR, and have in-creased the public demand for these products to beUVR rated. A dual approach is needed to ensure thatthere is an effective reduction in solar UVR exposureof the population. Reduction of an individual's totalUVR exposure at work is pointless if they thenspend the entire weekend sunning themselves on thebeach.3. Results3.1. UVR protecti Àùe eyewear and sunglassesThe general public will normally use commer-cially available sunglasses as eye protection whileoutdoor workers will generally be supplied withprotective eyewear. The requirements for sunglasses
wx are well covered by the SAA standard 2 , whilethose for protective eyewear are covered by AS 1337. wx1992 3 , both standards setting limits on the UVRtransmittances allowed by the lenses. Sunglasseswx complying with AS1067 2 will provide a consider-able degree of protection. Fig. 2 shows the spectraltransmittancesof three pairs of sunglasses, one which.No. 1 fails to comply with the optical transmittancewx requirements of the standard 2 , since they havesignificant transmittance in the UVR spectral region.Sunglasses 2 and 3 both pass the standard, No. 3having especially low UVR transmittances and there-fore providing a very high degree of protection.Fig. 2. The spectral transmittances of three sunglasses. SunglassesNo. 1 fail to comply with the optical transmittance requirementswx of the standard 2 while No. 2 passes and No. 3 passes and hasalmost 100% absorption in the UVR region.Occasionally this additional protection may be nec-
essary, for example, when a person undergoes PUVAtherapy for psoriasis, they should avoid UVR expo-sure of the eye for several days, in particular UVAexposure. Also, people who have had one of theirlenses surgically removed should then wear virtually100% UVR protective sunglasses, such as sunglassNo. 3. Currently it is very difficult to ascertain whatprotection is offered by eyewear. A scheme similarto SPFs for sunscreens has been proposed for sun-wxglasses 28 , where each pair which complies with. AS 1067 is given an eye protection factor EPFbased on the biologically effective solar UVR trans-mitted by the sunglass lens. In addition to UVRprotection other requirements for eyewear used foroccupational protection include robust construction,shatterproof lenses and other safety requirements.wx Compliance with the Australian Standard 2 for
wx Compliance with the Australian Standard 2 forsunglasses became mandatory in 1988. This hassignificantly raised the UVR protective properties ofsunglasses currently on the market. The number ofexamples of sunglasses which claim 100% protectionagainst UVR has increased sharply and the numberwhich fail the standard or which have poor UVRprotective properties has diminished significantly.Companies selling sunglasses which fail to complywith the mandatory standard can have substantialfines imposed.

Sunscreenswx The Australian Sunscreen Standard 1 is currentlyundergoing revision and will shortly raise the maxi-. mum allowed sun protection factor SPF claim from15qto 30 q. The higher the SPF, the greater theamount of protection provided by the sunscreen. Inline with the increasing current concerns about theeffects of UVA radiation, the standard sets in vitrotest methods for the determination of UVA transmit-tance of sunscreens. In general, sunscreens providegood protection, in particular if SPF 15 qsunscreensare chosen. Sunscreens that completely block UVBand absorb strongly in the UVA would be preferable.Education campaigns emphasizing correct applica-tion are required, since most surveys indicate thatsunscreens are applied at a thickness approximatelyhalf of that used in laboratory SPF determinations
wx29 , with a consequentreductionin the SPFachievedin practice. Thus sunscreens should not be used asthe sole method of protection but rather in conjunc- tion with clothing where the level of protection canbe very high and is independent of the method of. application to protect areas of the body not coveredby the garment.3.3. Clothing and UVR protectionCancer Council education campaigns have longurged the use of clothing in conjunction with hatsand sunscreens as UVR protection. A joint surveybetween the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria and theAustralian Radiation Laboratory of typical summerT-shirts in the summer of 1991 indicated that not allclothing provided sufficient protection against solarUVR. Further work soon showed that almost one third of summer-weight clothing cotton and. wx polyester-cotton provided less protection 30 thanwould be expected from an SPF 15 qsunscreen,
would be expected from an SPF 15 qsunscreen,with protection factors sometimes as low as 5 to 10.Given the increasing interest in protection againstsolar UVR, both as regards recreational exposuresbut also particularly for the provision of clothing foroutdoor workers, it was felt that a rating scheme forclothing would allow individuals the choice of gar-ments with sufficient UVR protection. The ultravio-. let protection factor UPF scheme for clothing wastherefore devised at the Australian Radiation Labora-wxtory 30 , and eventually a modified version of thiswas adopted by the Australian and New Zealandwx Standard 5 . Test methods developed at the Aus-tralian Radiation Laboratory and the University of. New South Wales Unisearch were also adopted inwx this standard 5 . The protection categories and al-lowed UPF ratings from the current Australian rNewZealand Standard are shown in Table 2.Fig. 3 shows the daily total ambient solar UVReff
Fig. 3 shows the daily total ambient solar UVRefflevels as measured in Melbourne over the course ofthe year.

Swingtags issued by ARL showing the UPF rating with aprotection message from the Australian Cancer Soci-ety on the reverse side can be used to denote theamount of protection provided by various garments.To date, in excess of 5 million such swing tags havebeen used on UVR rated garments. Design consider-ations such as long sleeves and collars are also veryimportant in sun protective clothing in an effort tomaximize the amount of body coverage and thus theprotection provided.There are many factors which play a role in theamount of protection provided by fabrics.

This is due in part to increasing awareness ofthe hazards of exposure to solar UVR, and partly dueto perception that there is a real demand for commer-cial products which provide UVR protection. Themandatory sunglass standard in Australia has raised
() P.H. Gies et al. rMutation Research 422 1998 15¬±22 21the quality of sunglasses available substantially. Theintroduction of other standards has also improved thesituation as regards protection. One of the mostsignificant changes was the entrance of the variousstate Cancer Councils into the marketing of UVRprotective items. This ensured that the public wasable to purchase appropriate sunscreens, sunglasses,UVR rated clothing and hats at a reasonable cost. Ifsuch items are inexpensive, then people who wish touse UVR protection will not be discouraged byeconomic factors, an important consideration in at-tempts to widen their use.As a visit to almost any Australian beach in
As a visit to almost any Australian beach insummer will show, there are still many people whohave not yet heard or implemented the advice fromthe various educational campaigns run by the stateCancer Councils. Nevertheless, the awareness of anddemand for items of personal protection against solarUVR is increasing substantially in Australia, indicat-ing that the educational campaigns are beginning tobe successful. Over the last 5 to 10 years the numberand range of items available which offer protectionagainst solar UVR has seen a massive increase. TheAustralian Radiation Laboratory publishes a guidewx  37 which lists products and the companies that. produce them which provide protection against solarUVR and the number listed increases each year.Many people are heeding the advice and choosing touse hats, sunscreens, UVR rated clothing and sun-glasses in an effort to reduce their solar UVR expo-wx sures. The standards covering these items 1¬±5 are
necessary to ensure that the protection sought isactually achieved. Continuation of the successfulstate Cancer Council educational campaigns is alsovital.5. Conclusions.1 Australia has high ambient levels of solarUVR, with resulting high skin cancer rates..2 All forms of personal protection available, inconjunction with public education programmes re-quired to induce behavioural changes, should be usedin an attempt to reduce the UVR exposures of thepopulation..3 Use of the various forms of protection and sunavoidance behaviour can reduce an individual's solarUVR exposure to a few percent of that without anyprotection.Referenceswx1 Standards Australia rStandards New Zealand, Sunscreenproducts√êevaluationandclassification,ReportNo. AS2604,Sydney rWellington, 1993.wx2 Standards Australia, Sunglasses and fashion spectacles√ênonprescription types, Report No. AS 1067.1, Sydney, 1990.wx3 Standards Australia rStandards New Zealand, Eye protectors
