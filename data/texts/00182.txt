Molecules 2014 , 19 6203   1. Introduction  Due to its anatomic location at the external boundary of  the body, skin is expos ed to a variety of environmental factors such as UV ra diation that derives naturally fr om the sun. Solar UV exposure is a major causative factor for age-related changes such  as skin cancer devel opment. UV radiation is composed of UVA, UVB and UVC components based on photon wavelength with UVA having the longest wavelengths (315–400 nm), UVB being mi d-range (290–320 nm) and UVC being the shortest wavelengths (100–280 nm). Ambient sunlight is composed primar ily of UVA (90%–95%) and  UVB (5%–10%) energy, with most solar UVC absorbed by the ozone layer (Figure 1).  Figure 1.  UV radiation in ambient sunlight is composed primarily of UVA and UVB energy. Most UVC is absorbed by the ozone , therefore although it is  highly bioactive, terrestrial organisms are not exposed to sign ificant levels of UVC. UVB can cause direct
damage to DNA and reach the epidermis. UV A can penetrate the dermis and increases levels of ROS that indire ctly induce DNA mutagenesis.  Naturally occurring UV radiation is the environmenta l mutagen responsible for the largest percentage of environmentally induced skin pathologies, including erythema and in flammation, degenerative aging changes, and cancer [1]. Humans are expose d to UV radiation primarily as a consequence of unprotected exposure to sunlight [2]. UV radiation has many delete rious effects on cells [3–5]. UV radiation produces both direct and indirect DNA damage, and each can re sult in mutagenesis in skin cells. The DNA double helix can absorb energy from shorter-wave UV photons and undergo covalent
Molecules 2014 , 19 6204   modification. Neighboring py rimidines are particularly vulnerable to direct UV da mage at the 5–6 double bond position. When UV causes this bond to break, abnor mal covalent interac tions between adjacent thymines and/or cytosines can result. There are tw o main DNA lesions that result from UV-induced damage to the 5–6 double bond: (1) cyclobutane dime rs formed from two covalent bonds between adjacent pyrimidines to form a ring structure; and (2) pyrimidine 6–4 pyrimidone (6,4)- photoproducts that form upon reaction of the op en 5–6 double bond with the exocyc lic moiety of an adjacent  3' pyrimidine [6]. Both of these lesions distor t the double helix and can lead to mutation, and an individual skin cell may accumulate up to 1 00,000 such lesions from one day’s worth of sun  exposure [7]. UV radiation also damages cellula r macromolecules indirectly, through production of
oxidative free radicals [8]. Seve ral DNA modifications can result from oxidative injury, including  7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoguanine;  8-OH-dG), which promotes mutagenesis (specifically  GC-TA transversion mutations [9]. Both direct a nd indirect DNA changes inte rfere with transcription and replication, and render skin cel ls susceptible to mutagenesis. Mu ch of solar UV en ergy is absorbed by stratospheric ozone, and the grad ual depletion of stratospheric oz one over the last several decades has resulted in higher levels of so lar UV radiation that strikes the su rface of the Earth [10]. Increased ambient UV radiation from global climate change may be an important factor to explain the burgeoning prevalence of melanoma and skin cancer over the last several decades [11–14].  UVB is a well-characterized muta gen and inducer of skin cancers [15], but recent studies have
implicated an increasing role of UVA as a carci nogen [16–18] likely through its pro-oxidative effects and possibly through other mechanisms such as telome re shortening [19]. In addition, UVA is less able to induce melanin production compared to UVB, leavi ng the skin less able to protect itself against further UV insult [15,19–22]. Increasing attention is being paid to the poten tial impact of UVA radiation to the body focusing on di fferential cellular repair and ap optosis depending on anatomic  site [23]. The role of UVA in melanoma formation is also suggested by the observation of rising melanoma incidence over the last several decad es and sunscreen use in the 1980s when only  UVB-blocking sunscreens were used.  2. Factors Contributing to UV Exposure  Geographical variations such as altitude, latitude and urbanization all determine ambient UV strength. Because atmospheric partic les such as dust or water droplets can scatter, reflect or otherwise
interfere with UV photons, the more atmosphere sunlig ht has to traverse, the weaker its energy will be at the surface of the Earth. At higher altitudes, w ith less atmosphere for sunlight to traverse before hitting land, there is higher exposure to UV and a hi gher risk for melanoma. There is a 2% increase in risk with every 10 m rise in alt itude [24] and in addition those liv ing at altitudes over 1,400 m above sea level are at most risk for developing melanoma [25]. In addition to liv ing in high altitudes, occupations routinely operating at high altitudes such as airplane p ilots and mountain guides have a higher incidence of melanoma a nd precancerous lesions [26,27].  UV strength is strongest at the equator because sunli ght hits the Earth most directly at the equator. Toward the poles, sunlight hits the earth obliquely and must pa ss through more atmosphere. Not surprisingly, there is a higher incide nce of melanoma in locales closest to the equator, most especially
among Caucasians [28] who are most UV-sensitive because of lower cutaneous melanin pigments, but
Molecules 2014 , 19 6205   also among lower-risk populations of darker skin tone [29]. In a study of the Norwegian Cancer Registry, decreased latitude by 10° was associated  with a 2–2.5 increased ri sk of melanoma [30]. Another study of 5,700 melanoma cases worldwide found a 1.5-fold increased risk when living at latitudes closer than 20° from the equator [31] . Importantly, though latitude risk for melanoma has been historically strong, recent studies suggest decr eased correlation [32], or even an opposite trend.  A 2012 study of Northern Europeans, for example, showed an increase in melanoma incidence with increase in latitude beyond 50° north of the equator [ 33], perhaps due to the dram atic rise in artificial indoor tanning. Urban-versus-rural lifestyle also seems to be important, with as much as a 50% increased melanoma risk in urban regions [34] . Urbanization may affect cancer risk by bringing together many independent
risk factors such as occupational chemical exposure, social pressure s regarding skin appearance, easy access to indoor tanning, and higher socio-economic le vels lending to increased use of indoor tanning and holiday travel [35]. The increase in urbanization worldwide and the increase in these activities may help explain the rise in melanoma rates for nor thern Caucasian populations that would otherwise not be exposed to natural risk f actors such as latitude [24].  3. Age  UV exposure may account for up to 80% of visible signs of aging in the skin including dry appearance, scalping, wrinkling [ 15] and impaired pigmentation, and photoaging correlates with cancer risk. A 2012 study of Central Europeans, for example, showed those with early signs of wrinkling on the neck were over four times more su sceptible to melanoma th an the general population. Freckling on the back also showed  over three times the risk [21]. Cutaneous photoaging and melanoma
risk both correlate with age and UV exposure. The average age of me lanoma diagnosis is about 55 and incidence varies worldwide from five to ove r 60 cases per 100,000 people per year [12]. Although melanoma is a malignancy mostly diagnosed in the fi fth and sixth decade of life, one fifth of cases occur in young adults [36,37]. It is  important to note, however, that the UV e xposure and accumulation of DNA damage that underlie melanoma formation begin with sun exposure ea rly in youth, which is why sun protection in the pediatric years is so impor tant. There is a significan t correlation of melanoma risk with excessive sun exposure be fore adolescence, perhaps contribu ted to by structural anatomical differences between the skin of children and adults making it easier for UV to penetrate [38]. Childhood UV exposure also increases the risk of young adult melanoma (melanoma under the age of 30) by over
three times, showing how exposure can accelerate the proc ess of carcinogenesis [39]. Furthermore, a new study published in 2014 of over three million peopl e in Sweden showed that accumulation of UV damage begins as early as in the neonate, with melanoma incidence increased in those born in the spring and summer  versus  those born in the fall or winter [40]. Indeed, some es timates indicate that up to 80% of lifetime UV exposure occurs before the age of 20 because of the outdoor recreational habits of children. This risk for melanoma among the middle-aged popula tion has risen in the past few decades. An epidemiologic study in Minnesota found an inci dence of 60 cases per 100,000 in 2009 compared to just eight per 100,000 in 1970; that  is a 24-fold increase in ri sk for this population. Another unfortunate finding is the steady increase in occu rrence in young adults, particularly for young women
Molecules 2014 , 19 6206   in the United States (US). Whereas young American women aged 15–39 had a melanoma incidence rate of 6 out of 100,000 cases  in 1973, their rate more  than doubled to 14 out  of 100,000 cases per year in 2006 [41]. Because of ongoing recreat ional UV trends such as increa sed use of artificial tanning sources, melanoma rates are expected to continue to rise [37], making this di sease an increasing public health threat.  4. Artificial UV and Tanning Beds  Indoor tanning use has dramatically ri sen in the last thirty years and is predicted to continue rising largely because of societal and commercial incentives for a tanned appearance viewed by many as appealing. In 2013, over 40% of adol escents aged 15 to 18 had tried indoor tann ing with about 18% using indoor tanning routinely [42]. A recent larg e-scale systematic review, published in 2014, reported that over 50% of college-aged students trie d indoor tanning, with over 40% using it in the past
year. In a 2014 study of college-aged women from 18 to  25 years of age, 25% of  current users could be classified as tanning-dependent [ 43]. Similarly, prevalence among Amer ican adults may be as high  as 35% [42,44]. Interestingly, tann ing behavior has increasingly been  compared to classic “substance use” disorders, with so me classifying frequent indoor UV pa tronage as a true addiction [45,46]. Tanning-addictive behaviors have been associated es pecially with young age, other high-risk behaviors and psychiatric disorders [45,46]. Indoor tanning involves exposure to high doses of UV with the intent to trigger skin pigmentary responses. Tanning beds emit varying blends of UVA and UVB energy, and their use is clearly linked with ph otoaging, keratinocyte mali gnancies and melanoma. Generally, most basic tanning beds emit a blend of UVB and UVA radiation with more advanced beds emitting mostly UVA radiation to emulate natura l UV radiation. However, with UVA now firmly
implicated in melanoma carcinogenesis, such be ds may be no safer than those with higher UVB output. Alarmingly, despite strong epidemiologic data  correlating younger age of tanning bed use with skin cancers, tanning bed use among minors is poorly  regulated and its use increasing. In 2013, the National Conference of State Legislatures of US A approved new laws limiting or banning the use of tanning beds by adolescents, however actual laws  that govern indoor tanning among minors vary by state with most states not prohibiting use among mi nors. Use of tanning salons before the age  of 35 years is associated with a 75% increased lif etime melanoma risk [47], therefore the increasing use of tanning beds may be an impo rtant factor to explain the incr easing incidence of  melanoma in recent decades.  5. Sunburns and Melanoma Overexposure to UV is a key factor in developm ent of skin cancers, and melanoma incidence
correlates particularly with inte rmittent intense UV exposures that cause sunburn. More than five sunburns in a lifetime doubles risk for melanoma and there is increased risk for melanoma as a young adult if there are increased sunburns in childhood [31,39,48]. The melanoma-sunburn link may reflect the contribution of inflammatory me diators to carcinogenesis or perh aps a particular threshold above which the dose of UV must exceed in order to tr ansform melanocytes. Nonetheless, intense blistering sunburns seem to play a role in ma ny cases of melanoma. Unfortunatel y, over half of all adults in the US suffered from sunburn in 2013 and prevalence of sunburn in the US population today is over 50%
Molecules 2014 , 19 6207   in all adults and over 65% in fair-skinned young adu lts under the age of 30. Furthermore, prevalence of sunburn has not declined despite the variety of lotions, sprays and clothing advertised and available for sun protection [49]. Risk of sunburn is complex and influenced by a variety of factors ranging from geography, cloud cover, climat e, societal norms relating to amount of clothing worn,  etc. Not surprisingly, incidence of sunburns in children (and indoor tanning use among adolescents) correlates with parental attitudes regarding sun protection. For this reason, educational campai gns targeted at parents’ ideas about UV safety might be particul arly useful for prevention and pr otection against UV-induced skin pathologies [50].  6. The Melanocortin 1 Receptor (MC1R) and the Tanning Response  One important aspect of the solar radiation in hu man’s skin is the adaptive tanning response. After
UV exposure, cellular damage response activation induces melanin production by melanocytes and proliferation and melanin deposition in keratinocytes , all of which result in enhanced pigmentation of the skin. This important physiologic pathway is a na tural UV-protective respons e to protect the skin against further UV insult after an initial UV exposure.  The ability of the skin to tan depends on the function and activity of the cutaneous melanocor tin 1 receptor (MC1R) signaling pathway [51–55] (Figure 2).  Figure 2.  MC1R signaling cascade in melanocytes . Activated by its agonist alpha-MSH, MC1R promotes cAMP second messenge r generation which induces melanocyte differentiation and survival pathways involvi ng PKA, CREB and Mitf. In this way, cAMP induces both melanin production and antioxidant s that reduce cellular ROS. cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate. PKA, protein kina se A. pCREB, phosphorylated cAMP
response binding element. ROS, reactive oxygen species. MITF, microphthalmia (Mitf) transcription factor.
Molecules 2014 , 19 6208   The MC1R is a G s-couple protein located in the extracellu lar membranes of epidermal melanocytes. When bound by agonistic ligands, most notably α-melanocyte stimulating hormone ( α-MSH) [51], the MC1R initiates a cascade of UV-protective events mediated by activation of  adenylyl cyclase and generation of the second messenger cAMP. MC1R activ ates adenylate cyclase that converts ATP to cAMP which activates protein kinase A (PKA) . PKA phosphorylates the cAMP-responsive binding element (CREB) and induces activa tion of the microphthalmia (MITF) transcription factor. MITF is a myc-like master transcription factor that, in mela nocytes, drives expression of tyrosinase and other pigment biosynthetic enzymes. In this way, epidermal melanocytes pr oduce melanin pigment that gets deposited in the epidermis to physically interfere with penetration of UV photons, thereby protecting
skin cells from the damaging effects of sunlight [ 56]. Importantly, MC1R signa ling also influences the ability of melanocytes to recover from UV-induced  DNA damage [57–61]. Overall, there is much evidence placing MC1R as a “master regulator ” of melanocyte UV physiologic responses.  7. Pigmentation Phenotype De pends on MC1R Signaling  Loss-of-function polymorphisms of MC 1R lead to a fair-skinned, sun- sensitive, and cancer-prone phenotype [62–64]. The major MC1R polymorphisms am ong human populations are the so-called “red hair colored” (RHC) genotypes th at yield a characteristic UV-sen sitive and melanoma-prone phenotype, namely propensity for sun burning rather than tann ing, fair skin complexion, freckling and red/blonde hair. The RHC phenotype include R151C, R160W and D294H MC1R genotypes [65–67]. In these cases, there is blunted cAMP pr oduction in melanocytes, and the sk in produces less of the highly
UV-protective dark brown/black pigment species know n as eumelanin. Instead, there is production of a red/blonde pigment known as pheomelanin that is much less effective at blocking incoming UV energy and may even potentiate UV-induced oxidativ e injury. Without effec tive cAMP induction in melanocytes, as is the case in MC1R-defective i ndividuals, the skin cannot accumulate significant amounts of eumelanin and therefore will be prone to UV damage and carcinogenesis.  8. Forskolin Rescues cAMP Deficient Signaling  Forskolin is a naturally derived diterp enoid extracted from the roots of the Plectranthus barbatus  (Coleus forskolii ) plant that grows naturally in Asia and th at has long been used in various Aryuvedic teas and therapeutic preparations. Forskolin, which is a skin-permeable com pound, directly activates adenylate cyclase to induce produc tion of cAMP. Our laboratory was among the first to show that
topical application of fors kolin promoted UV-independe nt production of eumelani n in an MC1R-defective fair-skinned animal model [53] , resulting in robust UV protection by interfering with epidermal penetration of UV photons [68]. Phar macologic stimulation of cAMP using forskolin may protect the skin in ways other than through melanin inducti on. For example, cAMP provided enhancement of keratinocyte migration to promote wound healing [69] and it also decr eased blister formation [70].  De Vries and co-workers proposed using a topical  cAMP approach to regulate beta-adrenergic response in psoriasis patients [71] . Interestingly, cAMP stimulation has also been studied as an activator of hair follicle  activity and has been  considered as a th erapy for age-relate d hair loss [72,73]. We and others have been interest ed in the UV-protective consequen ces of topical cAMP induction to promote melanin protection from UV-mediated DNA damage [68] a nd to enhance levels and/or
Molecules 2014 , 19 6209   activity of key DNA repair and antioxidant enzymes [74]. Forskolin and other cAMP-promoting agents may also protect the sk in against UVB-induced apoptosis [75] and by promoting epidermal thickening which also aids in resisti ng UV damage [76]. In particular, Scott  et al.  reported that  cAMP-mediated accumulation of basal and epidermal keratinocytes resulted in a melanin-independent mechanism of blocking UVA and UVB penetration into the skin [76]. Others reported that forskolin protected against generation of oxidative stress by decr easing levels of nitric oxide [77] and enhancing stimulation of the cytoplasmic antioxidant enzyme copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/ZnSOD) [78]. Taken together, studies suggest th at pharmacologic induct ion of cAMP in the skin may represent a potential UV-protective strategy for MC1R-defective individuals who are fair-skinned, sun-sensitive and melanoma prone.  9. Oxidative Stress and Aging
9. Oxidative Stress and Aging  Reactive oxidative species (ROS) are produced by cells during normal metabolic activities such as mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, however levels of ROS vary with UV exposure and levels of antioxidant enzymes. Figure 3 shows a simplified scheme of the location of  protective antioxidant enzymes in the cell (Figure 3).  Figure 3.  Cellular antioxidant defenses. UV induces  a variety of free radical and oxidative molecules, which because of their chemical reactivity alter the molecular structure and damage lipids, proteins and nucleic acids [ 79]. Antioxidant enzyme s mediate the removal of ROS, with different enzymes functio ning in specific compartments (e.g., MnSOD localized to mitochondria). If  not removed, ROS may react with DNA and other cell signal proteins, impairing their function. ECSOD, Ex tracellular Superoxide dismutase. Cu/Zn SOD, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase. MnSOD, Manganese Superoxide dismutase.
Molecules 2014 , 19 6210   Without inactivation, ROS damage macromolecu les including lipid, pr oteins and DNA. UV, particularly longer-wavelength UVA, is a well-known inducer of ROS, and UV-induced oxidative stress may be an important contributive factor  for melanoma [80–82]. ROS can inappropriately activate signaling pathways, interfere with genome  maintenance and affect apoptosis. Numerous studies have tested the effect s of solar radiation and oxidative stress on the skin [29,83–85], and oxidative stress has been linked to  age-related loss of skin elas ticity [86–88], defective cellular signaling [68] and photoaging [89,90]. Because it trigge rs cellular damage pathways, oxidative stress activates cellular senes cence which is thought to directly lead to photoaging  [91–94]. Cellular senescence is associated with a reduced capacity to divide and proliferate, sometimes in conjunction
with shortening of telomeres [95–98]. Yokoo  et al.  found that exposing cells to a pro-oxidant agent (H2O2) impaired telomerase function which eventual ly resulted in telomere shortening, decreased proliferation and cellular enlargemen t [97]. Wrinkling of th e skin is one of the most overt signs of photoaging, and UV exposure ca n induce wrinkling over time [99–102]. Though the molecular mechanism(s) of wrinkling are likely to be comp lex, UV exposure may reduce elastic properties of the skin to alter the three-dimensiona l structure of elastic fibers [ 103]. Using an animal model, Shin  et al.  noted an inverse correlation between wrinkling and important antioxidant  enzymes that reduce cellular levels of ROS [104]. Thus UV-induce d oxidative cutaneous damage may pl ay a major role in photoaging.  Cells have a network of antioxidants and antioxida nt enzymes that function to inactivate ROS and
limit free radical injury. Because they house the enzy mes that mediate the electron transport chain, mitochondria are the main intracel lular source of endogenous levels of ROS. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a mitochondrial protein, is a major regulator of ROS in the mitochondria. Glutathione is the most widely expr essed antioxidant in the cell, and its levels and oxidation state are regulated by feedback signaling de pendent on total ROS level. Incr eases in ROS lead to use and depletion of glutathione and trigger recruitment of an tioxidant enzymes such as catalase and superoxide dismutases (SODs).  Many synthetic and natural products have been repor ted to enhance levels of  antioxidant enzymes, which make them therapeutic candidates to mitigate UV-mediated damage and to prevent the health consequences of UV exposure. Some products incl ude alpha-tocopherol, sele nium, phloretin, ferulic
acid, flavangenol, lipoic acid, and uric acid [57,105–111]  as well as a variety of flavonoids derived from plants including pomegranate and strawbe rry [112,113]. Lipid-soluble carotinoids such as lycopene and beta-carotene have been reported to s cavenge superoxide radicals [114] and to promote vitamin A activity [115]. However, large doses of  UV may inactivate caroten oids in the skin and promote degradation of dermal collagen and elas tin [114,116]. Vitamin C is  another anti-oxidant compound that has been studied as a UV photoprotective agent [108], particularly  in combination with other compounds such as ferulic acid and phloretin [108].  There is emerging evidence implicating MC1R and cAMP signaling in regulating antioxidant proteins. Using keratinocytes transfected with MC1R, Henri  et al.  reported lower cellular levels of ROS after pharmacologic activati on MC1R/cAMP pathway and higher levels of ROS when PKA was
pharmacologically inhibited [117]. In other work  using human melanocytes, Song and colleagues found that αMSH-induced MC1R signaling incr eased levels of catalase afte r UV exposure. Catalase is
pharmacologically inhibited [117]. In other work  using human melanocytes, Song and colleagues found that αMSH-induced MC1R signaling incr eased levels of catalase afte r UV exposure. Catalase is an antioxidant enzyme that converts excess of h ydrogen peroxide molecules to water and molecular oxygen [118]. Finally, Kaderaro and coworkers reported that cAMP st imulation reduced levels of
Molecules 2014 , 19 6211   hydrogen peroxide, an important ROS, in human mela nocytes after UV exposure [74]. Therefore, there is great interest in exploiting the MC1R UV-protective signaling pathway as a protective mechanism against UV-mediated oxidative injury.  10. Conclusions UV exposure is one of the most important environm ental health hazards, clearly causative for  age-related skin changes such as wrinkling, pi gmentary changes, thinning and carcinogenesis.  Because of complex societal factors, UV expos ure may actually be increasing through increased occupational and recreational activ ities including indoor tanning. As we learn more about innate signaling mechanisms that regulate na tural antioxidant defense pathways in the skin such as the MC1R hormonal axis, new approaches are being designed to exploit these signaling path ways to delay or even prevent free-radical induced symptoms of aging. Use of natural extracts  such as forskolin derived from
the roots of the Plectranthus barbatus (Coleus forskolii) plant may enha nce protection against  UV-induce molecular damage to the skin. cA MP-induced melanin deposition and antioxidant induction may prove to be an important therapeutic  opportunity to reduce UV-me diated pathologies.
