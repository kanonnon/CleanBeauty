In this context,mutations to and activation of genes may be important.Other responses likely to result from UVR exposure of cellsinclude increased cellular proliferation, which could have atumor-promoting effect on genetically altered cells, as wellas changes in components of the immune system present intheskin[2].Solar radiation was tested for carcinogenicity in a series
of exceptional studies in mice and rats. Large numbers ofanimals were studied, and well-characterized benign andmalignant skin tumors developed in most of the survivinganimals. Although the reports are deficient in quantitativedetails,theresultsprovideconvincingevidencethatsunlightis carcinogenic for the skin of animals [ 3].

Most important oxidative damage prevention mecha-nisms include antioxidative enzymatic and nonenzymaticdefenses as well as repair processes. But the problem ariseswith age, when endogenous antioxidative mechanisms andrepair processes do not work anymore in the effective way.The identification of free radical reactions as initiators andpromoters of the cancer process implies that interventionsaimed at limiting or inhibiting these factors should be abletoreducetherateofcancerincidence.Therestillremainstheanswer regarding controversial data on the use of syntheticantioxidantsincancerpreventionandtreatment.2. Skin Antioxidant DefensesAlthoughtheskinpossessesanelaborateantioxidantdefensesystem to deal with oxidative stress, excessive and chronicexposuretoUVlightorotheroxidizingagents(e.g.,cigarettesmoke) can overwhelm the cutaneous antioxidant andimmune response capacity, leading to oxidative damage andimmunotoxicity,prematureskinaging,andskincancer.

stance that when present at low concentrations comparedto those of an oxidizable substrate significantly delays orprevents oxidation of that substrate [ 6]. Antioxidant func-tions are associated with lowering oxidative stress, DNAdamage, malignant transformation, and other parametersof cell damage in vitroas well as epidemiologically withloweredincidenceofcertaintypesofcanceranddegenerativediseases. Antioxidants attenuate the damaging effects ofreactiveoxygenspecies(ROS)andcanimpairand/orreversemany of the events that contribute to epidermal toxicity anddisease. However, increased or prolonged free radical actioncanoverwhelmROSdefensemechanisms,contributingtothedevelopment of cutaneous diseases, disorders, and skin can-cer.Thetwomaincategoriesofantioxidantdefensesarethosew h o s er o l ei st op r e v e n tt h eg e n e r a t i o no fR O Sa n dt h o s ethatinterceptanyradicalsthataregenerated[ 7].Thedefense
system exists in aqueous and membrane compartments ofcells and can be enzymatic and nonenzymatic. A secondcategory of natural antioxidants are repair processes, whichremovethedamagedbiomoleculesbeforetheyaccumulatetocausealteredcellmetabolismorviability[ 7].The skin is equipped with a network of protectiveantioxidants. They include enzymatic antioxidants such asglutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase,and nonenzymatic low-molecular-weight antioxidants suchas vitamin E isoforms, vitamin C, glutathione (GSH), uricacid, and ubiquinol [ 8]. Various other components presentinskinarepotentantioxidantsincludingascorbate,uricacid,carotenoids, and sulfhydrils. Water-soluble antioxidants inplasma include glucose, pyruvate, uric acid, ascorbic acid,bilirubin,andglutathione.Lipid-solubleantioxidantsincludealpha-tocopherol,ubiquinol-10,lycopene, ùõΩ-carotene,lutein,
zeaxanthin, and alpha-carotene. In general, the outer partof the skin, the epidermis, contains higher concentrationsof antioxidants than the dermis [ 9,10].

Lipophilic antiox-idants (alpha-tocopherol, ubiquinol 9, and ubiquinone 9)andhydrophilicantioxidants(ascorbicacid,dehydroascorbicacid, and glutathione) were also higher in epidermis thanin dermis. The stratum corneum (SC) was found to containboth hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants. Vitamins Cand E (bothùõæ-a n dùõº- t o c o p h e r o l s )a sw e l la sG S Ha n du r i cacid were found to be present in the SC [ 12]. Surprisingly,they were not distributed evenly, but in gradient fashion,with low concentrations on the outer layers and increasingconcentrations toward the deeper layers of the SC. Thisphenomenon may be explained by the fact that O2partialpressure is higher in the upper SC, which already causesa mild oxidative stress resulting in the partial depletion ofantioxidants.
Taken together, all the major antioxidant enzymes arep r e s e n ti ns k i nb u tt h e i rr o l ei np r o t e c t i n gc e l l sa g a i n s toxidativedamagegeneratedbyUVRhasnotbeenelucidated.In response to the attack of ROS, the skin has developeda complex antioxidant defense system including, amongothers,themanganese-superoxidedismutase(MnSOD).Thestudy of Poswig et al. [ 13]r e v e a l e dt h a ta d a p t i v ea n t i o x i -dantresponseofmanganese-superoxidedismutasefollowingrepetitive UVA irradiation can be induced. The authorsprovide evidence for the increasing induction of MnSODupon repetitive UVA irradiation that may contribute to theeffective adaptive UVA response of the skin during lighthardening in phototherapy. The study of Fuchs et al. [ 5]on mouse skin showed that acute UV exposures lead alsoto changes in glutathione reductase and catalase activityin mouse skin but to insignificant changes in superoxide
dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. The study of Sanderet al. [14] confirmed that chronic and acute photodamagearemediatedbydepletedantioxidantenzymeexpressionandincreasedoxidativeproteinmodifications.3. The Importance of Antioxidants inDecreasing ROS Formation and SkinCancer PreventionThe only protection of our skin against UVR is its endoge-nous protection (melanin and enzymatic antioxidants) andantioxidants we consumed with the food (vitamin A, C, E,etc.). Dietary antioxidants thus play a major role in main-taining the homeostasis of the oxidative balance. Vitamin C(ascorbicacid),vitaminE(ùõº-tocopherol),beta-carotene,andother micronutrients such as carotenoids, polyphenols, andselenium have been evaluated as antioxidant constituents inthe human diet. UVR exposure affects the skin antioxidants.
Ascorbate, GSH, SOD, catalase, and ubiquinol are depletedinUV-Bexposedskin,bothdermisandepidermis.Levelsofelectron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) detectable ascorbylradicals rise on UV exposure of skin. Studies of culturedskin cells and murine skin in vivohave indicated that UVR-induced damage involves the generation of ROS and deple-tion of endogenous antioxidant systems [ 15]. For example,inthestudybyShindoetal.[ 8],enzymaticandnonenzymaticantioxidants in epidermis and dermis and their responsesto ultraviolet light of hairless mice were compared. Afterirradiation epidermal and dermal catalase and superoxidedismutase activities were greatly decreased. ùõº-Tocopherol,ubiquinol 9, ubiquinone 9, ascorbic acid, dehydroascorbica c i d ,a n dr e d u c e dg l u t a t h i o n ed e c r e a s e di nb o t he p i d e r m i sanddermisby26‚Äì93%.Oxidizedglutathioneshowedaslight,nonsignificant increase.

Many other studies confirmed thatacute exposure of human skin to UVR in vivoleads tooxidationofcellularbiomoleculesthatcouldbepreventedbyprior antioxidant treatment. There have been many studiesperformed where different antioxidants or combinations ofantioxidants and different phytochemicals were tested inorder to find evidence against ROS-induced damage. Theoutcomesofthestudiesexaminingtheinfluenceofexogenousantioxidantsonthephotoagingordamageprotectiveeffects,which are relevant for clinical practice, were in detailspresentedelsewherebyPandeletal.[ 16]andPoljsaketal.[ 17].4. Vitamin COral vitamin C supplements (500mg/day) were taken by12 volunteers for 8 weeks resulting in significant rises inplasma and skin vitamin C content [ 15]. Supplementation
had no effect on the UVR-induced erythemal response.The skin malonaldehyde content was reduced by vitaminC supplementation, but, surprisingly, reductions in the skincontent of total glutathione and protein thiols were alsoseen.Authorsspeculatethatthisapparentlyparadoxicaleffectcouldbeduetoregulationoftotalreductantcapacitybyskincells, such that vitamin C may have been replacing otherreductantsinthesecells.Ascorbic acid was a photoprotectant in clinical humanUV studies at doses just above the minimal erythema dose(MED). An opaque cream containing 5% ascorbic acid didnot induce dermal sensitization in 103 human subjects. Aproductcontaining10%ascorbicacidwasnonirritantina4-day minicumulative patch assay on human skin and a facialtreatment containing 10% ascorbic acid was not a contactsensitizer in a maximization assay on 26 humans [ 15].

However, topically applied alpha-tocopherol israpidly depleted by UVB radiation in a dose-dependentmanner[22].6.ùõΩ-CarotenùõΩ-carotene is a major constituent of commercially avail-ableproductsadministeredforsystemicphotoprotection. ùõΩ-carotene supplements are frequently used as so-called oralsun protectants, but studies proving a protective effect oforal treatment withùõΩ-carotene against skin responses tosun exposure are scarce and conflicting results have beenreported [ 23]. Studies on the systemic use of ùõΩ-caroteneprovideevidencethat15‚Äì30mg/doveraperiodofabout10‚Äì
provideevidencethat15‚Äì30mg/doveraperiodofabout10‚Äì12 weeks produces a protective effect against UV-inducederythema. Similar effects have been attributed to mixturesof carotenoids or after long-term intake of dietary productsrich in carotenoids. Supplementation with carotenoids con-tributes to basal protection of the skin but is not sufficientto obtain complete protection against severe UV irradia-tion [23]. Studies showed that the efficacy of ùõΩ-carotenein systemic photoprotection depends on the duration oftreatment and on the dose [ 23]. For successful intervention,treatment with carotenoids is needed for a period of at leastten weeks [ 24]. A study by Stahl et al. [ 25]w a sp e r f o r m e d
where carotenoids and tocopherols antioxidant effect wasinvestigated against scavenging of ROS generated duringphotooxidativestress.ItwasinvestigatedwhetherantioxidantoralsupplementationmayprotecttheskinfromUV-inducederythema. The antioxidants used in this study providedprotection against erythema in humans and may be usefulfor diminishing sensitivity to UV light. Heinrich et al. [ 26]additionallycomparedtheerythemaprotectiveeffectofbeta-carotene (24mg/d from an algal source) to that of 24mg/dof a carotenoid mix consisting of the three main dietarycarotenoids, beta-carotene, lutein, and lycopene (8mg/deach).Arandomized,placebo-controlledclinicaltrialontheefficacy of oralùõΩ-carotene (50mg/day over 5 years) in pre-v en tio no fskinca ncerinpa tien tswi thr ecen tno nmela no maskin cancer showed no significant effect of ùõΩ-carotene oneither number or time of occurrences of new nonmelanomaskin cancer [ 27]. In a separate trial among healthy men, 12
yearsofsupplementationwithùõΩ-carotene(50mgonalternatedays) produced no reduction of the incidence of malignantneoplasms,includingnonmelanomaskincancer[ 28].Itmustbe pointed out that these intervention trials were conductedw i t hp a t i e n t sw h o s es k i nc a n c e rw a sp r i m a r i l yU Vi n d u c e dand it remains to be seen whether antioxidants are clinicallyeffective in prevention of cutaneous chemocarcinogenesis[29]. Although the photoprotective effects of beta-carotenearethoughttooriginatefromitsantioxidantproperties,somestudiesdocumentedprooxidanteffectsofbeta-carotene.7. RetinoidsA study was done to compare the effects of dietary admin-istration of a vitamin A drug (13-cis-retinoic acid) to thenatural form of vitamin A (retinyl palmitate).

Coenzyme Q10It was recently reported that coenzyme Q10 protects againstoxidative stress-induced cell death and enhances the syn-thesis of basement membrane components in dermal andepidermalcells[ 32].CoenzymeQ10(CoQ10)wasreportedtoreduceROSproductionandDNAdamagetriggeredbyUVAirradiation in human keratinocytes in vitro.F u r t h e r ,C o Q 1 0wasshowntoreduceUVA-inducedMMPsinculturedhumandermal fibroblasts [ 33]. It was reported that it is considered

GlutathioneIn cell culture models using human skin cells, it has beenclearlyshownthatglutathionedepletionleadstoalargesensi-tizationtoUVA(334nm,365nm)andnear-visible(405nm)wavelengths as well as to radiation in the UVB (302nm,313nm) [ 35,36]. There is a direct correlation betweenthe levels of sensitization and cellular glutathione content.Additional evidence that glutathione is a photoprotectiveagent in skin cells is derived from experiments which havedemonstrated that glutathione levels in both dermis andepidermisaredepletedbyUVAtreatment[ 37].10.

[ 39] demonstrated that topical applicationof green tea polyphenols reduced UVB-induced oxidationof lipids and proteins and depletion of antioxidant enzymes.Other protective effects include the reduced production ofROSandlipidperoxidationproducts,areduceddepletionofLangerhans cells and of endogenous antioxidant systems asreportedbyAfaqandMukhtar[ 40].11. ConclusionsSkin DNA molecules are constantly ‚Äúbombarded‚Äù by ROSoriginatingfromendogenousprocessesaswellasfromenvi-ronmental agents and from radiation sources. Antioxidantsmight act by quenching free radicals and by enhancing theDNA enzyme repair systems through a posttranscriptionalgene regulation of transcription factors [ 41]. The repaircapacity of human skin cells therefore directly relates to theprobability of initiation of the carcinogenesis process and
eventually tumor formation. Evidence is accumulating thatdietary changes and special nutrients may help to reduceoxidative stress and free radical formation and thereby slowdown the skin damage process. Exogenous antioxidants likevitaminsCandEandmanyotherscannotbesynthesizedbythe human body and must be taken up by the diet. Since theeffectivenessofendogenousantioxidantsystemisdiminishedduringaging,theexogenoussupplementationofantioxidantsmight be a protective strategy against age-associated skinoxidativedamage.Itcanbeconcludedthatoxidativestressisaproblemofskincellsandendogenousaswellasexogenousantioxidantscouldplayanimportantroleindecreasingit.However,itisimportanttopretreattheskinwithantiox-

Animal and human studieshave convincingly demonstrated pronounced photoprotec-tive effects of ‚Äúnatural‚Äù and synthetic antioxidants whenapplied topically before UVR exposure. No significant pro-tective effects of melatonin or the vitamins when appliedalone or in combination were obtained when antioxidantswereappliedafterUVRexposure.UVR-inducedskindamageis a rapid event, and antioxidants possibly prevent suchdamage only when present in relevant concentration att h es i t eo fa c t i o na tt h eb e g i n n i n ga n dd u r i n go x i d a t i v estress [42]. Treatment of the skin with antioxidants afterthe damage was caused by UVR might cause additionalharmful effects on cell cycle control and apoptosis process.Antioxidants may thus have dichotomous activities withrespecttocarcinogenesis,namely,suppressingcarcinogenesisbypreventingoxidativedamagetoDNA[ 43]andpromoting

The most important strategy to reduce the risk ofs u nU Vr a d i a t i o nd a m a g ei st oa v o i dt h es u ne x p o s u r ea n dthe use of sunscreens.
