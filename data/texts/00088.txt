Mechanism of UVB-Induced Wrinkling of the Skin:Paracrine Cytokine Linkage between Keratinocytes andFibroblasts Leading to the Stimulation of ElastaseGenji Imokawa1In clinical studies, the formation of facial wrinkles hasbeen closely linked to the loss of elastic properties ofthe skin. Repetitive irradiation of animal skin withUVB radiation at suberythemal doses significantlyreduces its elastic properties, resulting in the forma-tion of wrinkles. Repetitive UVB irradiation elicits amarked alteration in the three-dimensional structureof elastic fibers, which is closely associated with asubsequent reduction in the elastic properties of the
skin. Although UVB irradiation stimulates the activityof fibroblast elastases in the dermis, a syntheticinhibitor specific for fibroblast elastases preventswrinkle formation. The close interrelationships amongwrinkle formation, elastic properties, and elastic fiberlinearity are revealed by the effects of differentconcentrations of the elastase inhibitor (R240.9),suggesting that enhanced elastase activity by dermalfibroblasts plays a pivotal role in the UVB wrinklingmechanism. Inin vitro studies we identified aparacrine linkage between keratinocytes and fibro-blasts that leads to wrinkle formation through theupregulation of fibroblast elastases. These studiessupport our hypothesis for a mechanism of wrinkleformation by which cytokine expression is activated inepidermal keratinocytes by UVB radiation and triggersdermal fibroblasts to increase their expression ofelastase.Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings (2009) 14,36–43; doi:10.1038/jidsymp.2009.11
36–43; doi:10.1038/jidsymp.2009.11INTRODUCTIONFacial wrinkles are the most prominent characteristic bywhich skin aging is recognized. Histologically, in aged andwrinkled skin, there is an accumulation of altered elasticfibers and degradation or degeneration of collagen bundles inthe dermis. However, there is no direct evidence that solarelastosis from sunlight causes wrinkle formations, and there isno published study showing that the dermis underlying facialwrinkles, especially at the most susceptible site, the corner ofthe eye, includes elastosis. Repetitive exposure to sunlighthas been thought to be the most plausible factor producingwrinkles because wrinkles frequently appear on the face.However, little is known about the precise physicochemicaland biological mechanism(s), which lead to the formation ofwrinkles due to sunlight exposure. This review focuses on our
long-term research directed towards clarifying the mechan-ism of formation of UVB-induced wrinkles in an evidence-based fashion.Wrinkling results from the loss of skin elasticityOur previous studies in mice and rats (Imayama et al., 1994;Imokawa et al ., 1995; Takema and Imokawa, 1998)suggested that cumulative UVB radiation causes degenera-tion in the three-dimensional structure of elastic fibers, whichresults in the loss of skin elasticity, and eventually leads towrinkle formation. Figure 1 shows the marked wrinkling ofhairless mouse skin induced by 2 weeks of daily UVBirradiation at a suberythemal dose, where the wrinkle scorecontinued to increase up to 12 weeks (Takema and Imokawa,1998). When changes in various elastic parameters weremeasured by a commercial instrument (Cutometer SEM 474,Courage and Khazaka, Cologne, Germany) after 14 weeks ofdaily UVB irradiation (Tsukahara et al., 2001a), all elastic
parameters (Ue, Uf, Ur and Uv) decreased significantly,which suggests that the loss of skin elasticity is directlyassociated with wrinkle formation. The close relationshipbetween loss of elasticity and wrinkle formation wascorroborated by our other studies using human facial skin(Takema et al., 1995; Akazaki and Imokawa, 2001; Akazakiet al., 2002). To clarify why the corners of the eyes are mostsusceptible to wrinkle formation among facial sites (Takemaet al., 1995), we measured the thickness and elasticity of skin

To clarify why the corners of the eyes are mostsusceptible to wrinkle formation among facial sites (Takemaet al., 1995), we measured the thickness and elasticity of skinon the face and on the ventral forearm of 170 women using aCutometer, and evaluated the effects of age and exposure tosunlight (Takema et al., 1994). Skin thickness decreased withREVIEW36 Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings (2009), Volume 14 &2009 The Society for Investigative DermatologyReceived 14 November 2008; accepted 13 January 20091School of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Tokyo University of Technology, Tokyo, JapanCorrespondence: Dr Genji Imokawa, Tokyo University of Technology, School of Bioscience and Biotechnology, 1404-1 Katakura Hachioji, Katayanagi I nstitute-W204, Tokyo 192-0982 Japan.E-mails: imokawa@bs.teu.ac.jp or imokawag@dream.ocn.ne.jpAbbreviations: SEM, scanning electron microscopy
age in ventral forearm skin, which has limited exposure tosunlight, but increased significantly in skin on the forehead,at the corners of the eyes and on the cheeks, which areexposed markedly to sunlight. Although skin elasticity (Ur/Uf)decreased with age on both the face and forearm, we foundthat during age-dependent changes in skin elasticity atvarious facial sites, the corner of the eye had the strongestage-dependent decline (Takema et al ., 1994). To furtherelucidate the susceptibility of the corners of the eyes towrinkle formation, we evaluated the effects of temporary skinfixation on wrinkle formation after UVB irradiation using thedorsal skin of hairless mice (Takema et al., 1996). In micetreated with UVB radiation immediately after production ofan artificial groove parallel to the midline using a cyanoa-crylate resin, wrinkles formed parallel to the midline, anuncommon direction for wrinkle formation in this mousemodel. These wrinkles did not disappear even when the skin
was stretched. No such changes were observed in mice inwhich the temporary groove was produced, but without UVBirradiation. This result indicates that temporary grooves orwrinkles, seen as laugh grooves in the corners of the eyes,may eventually become permanent as a result of the loss ofskin elasticity due to repetitive UVB irradiation. Thesefindings suggest strongly that wrinkle formation is closelyassociated with the loss of skin elasticity, which is induced byfrequent sunlight exposure.For a quantitative evaluation of facial wrinkles, a systemwas developed wherein the morphology of the skin surfacecould be evaluated directly in three dimensions (Akazaki andImokawa, 2001; Akazaki et al., 2002). This system employs a
non-invasive device that utilizes white light of halogen bulborigin and allows the computation of wrinkle depth andwidth, and other parameters of skin surface morphology. Anoptical system was devised so that light is transmitted througha slit and can measure not only replicas of the skin but alsothe skin surface directly. The measured area is 6.4 /C26.4 mm,and the theoretical resolution with a 50-magnification lens isless than 12.5 mm. The system was applied to study age-related changes in the morphology of wrinkles in the cornersof the eyes in women at varying ages. Representativeanalytical data obtained (Akazaki et al., 2002) demonstratedthat wrinkles rapidly increased in depth in women of 40 years
or older and plateaued at the age of 60 years. Surfacemorphology parameters yielded results similar to age-relatedchanges in wrinkles. When the depth and the width ofwrinkles in the corners of the eyes were plotted against age, aclose correlation was found between these parameters andchronological age (Akazaki et al., 2002). Therefore, it was ofconsiderable interest to determine whether severity ofwrinkles correlated with the reduction in elasticity of humanfacial skin. When the elasticity of the skin at the cornerof the eye was measured in 36 women aged 60 years or older,using a Cutometer and was compared with the depth or thewidth of wrinkles at the same sites, a significant inversecorrelation was found between the depth of wrinkles andskin elasticity (Akazaki et al., 2002) suggesting that wrinkleformation results from the preceding loss of skin elasticity.Skin elasticity is closely linked to the function of elastic fibersdue to their three-dimensional configuration
due to their three-dimensional configurationWe used scanning electron microscopy (SEM), combinedwith perfusion, resin injection, and selective digestion, todetermine the effects of UVB irradiation on the three-dimensional architecture of elastic fibers in rat hind limbskin (Imayama et al ., 1994). These SEM observations(Tsukahara et al., 2001b), showed that elastic fibers in the
(Tsukahara et al., 2001b), showed that elastic fibers in thedermal connective tissue of unexposed animals have anorderly pattern of relatively straight fibers arranged inmultiple dense layers. The fibers in each layer are orienteddifferently from the fibers in adjacent layers, producing ameshwork appearance. This orderly arrangement is main-tained until 15 weeks of age, when maturation is essentiallycomplete. SEM further showed that, after 6 weeks of UVBirradiation, elastic fibers in the exposed skin becametortuously deformed (Tsukahara et al., 2001b). Fibers in thesuperficial layer became increasingly tortuous, whereas thosein the deep layer remained straight. After 12 weeks of UVBirradiation, the fine branches developed into an irregularnetwork by anastomosing with each other, or by intercon-necting with the tortuous fibers in the superficial layer of thedermal connective tissue.We quantitated the deformation by measuring the linearity
of individual fibers every 3 weeks for 15 weeks, andconfirmed that the tortuosity of the fibers increased inaccordance with the total time of UV exposure (Imayamaet al., 1994). Generally, the elastic properties of unexposedcontrol skin decreased in the first 2 weeks, when the animalswere 3–5 weeks old, and then maintained at a certain leveluntil 25 weeks of age, shortly after maturation. In contrast, theelastic properties of UVB-irradiated skin decreased relativelysteeply in the first 2 weeks and showed a further gradualdecrease over the remainder of the irradiation period. Therewas a significant difference in the curve for one elasticparameter, the immediate distension (Ue), between controland UVB-irradiated skin. Curves for the other elasticparameters, such as delayed distension (Uv), immediateretraction (Ur), and final distension (Ue), each showedUVB +  − UVB −Figure 1 .Marked wrinkling in the dorsal skin of hairless mice after
14 weeks of UVB irradiation. A suberythemal dose of 50–65 mJ cm/C02wasadministered five times a week (reprinted with permission from Tsuji et al.,2001).www.jidonline.org 37G ImokawaMechanism of UVB-Induced Wrinkling of the Skin
features resembling those of the immediate distension (Ue)curve, which consisted of the initial, purely elastic compo-nent. Thus, exposure to UVB produces tortuous deformation,together with fraying of elastic fibers in rat skin. Thesedeformations may be responsible for the decline in skinelasticity in situ , because the tight fit of rat skin may beattributed to the ability of elastic fibers to resume a short,straight configuration after being stretched (Gibson andKenedi, 1970; Cua et al., 1990). Thus, it is likely that thetortuous appearance of elastic fibers suggests a loss of theiroriginal elasticity (Imayama and Bravermann, 1989). Thethree-dimensional alterations revealed by these SEM studiescorrelated with previous observations using light and electronmicroscopy (Smith et al., 1962; Mitchell, 1967; Stevanovic,
1976; Montagna and Carlisle, 1979). The pathogenicrelationships among the three-dimensional alterations ofelastic fibers, loss of skin elasticity, and wrinkle formationis also corroborated by other animal studies in which inducedwrinkles were repaired by CO2laser (Tsukahara et al., 2001c)or retinoic acid treatment (Tsukahara et al., 1999).UVB irradiation specifically stimulates elastase activity in thedermisTo determine what matrix proteases are linked to the loss ofskin elasticity, the activities of several matrix proteases in thedermis of UVB-irradiated mouse skin were measured at week14 (Tsukahara et al., 2004a). There was a significant increasein the activity of elastase in UVB-irradiated skin comparedwith non-irradiated skin. The increase in dermal elastaseactivity appeared 2 weeks after the onset of irradiation andcontinued until 18 weeks (Tsuji et al ., 2001). In contrast,
there was a slight, but not significant, increase in the activityof collagenase I in the dermis at week 14 in irradiated skincompared with non-irradiated skin. On the other hand, therewas a decrease in the activity of collagenase IV in irradiatedskin at the same time compared with non-irradiated skin.Thus, it is likely that enhanced elastase activity in the dermisof irradiated skin plays an important role in the degenerationof elastic fibers, which eventually results in the loss of skinelasticity.A specific inhibitor of human skin fibroblast elastase preventsthe UVB-induced formation of wrinkles and maintains the linearconfiguration of elastic fibers and skin elasticityWe designed an inhibitor specific for human skin fibroblast
elastase to determine whether that enzyme is responsible forthe degeneration of elastic fibers, leading to a loss of elasticityin the skin. Comparing the effects of various protease inhibitors(Tsuji et al., 2001) revealed that neutrophil elastase is inhibitedby serine protease inhibitors, such as PMSF and elastatinal, butis not inhibited by the other inhibitors tested. In contrast,fibroblast elastase is inhibited remarkably by metal-chelatingagents (such as EDTA and phenanthrolin) and by a metallo-protease inhibitor (phosphoramidon), but it is not inhibited bythe serine protease inhibitors (PMSF or elastatinal), by a thiolprotease inhibitor (leupeptin) or by a carboxyl proteaseinhibitor (pepstatin A). These results indicate that fibroblastelastase does indeed belong to the metalloprotease family.In designing a specific inhibitor for skin fibroblast elastase,
it should be noted that phosphoramidon is known as a typicalinhibitor of metalloprotease, but that it has poor permeabilitythrough the skin because of its hydrophilic rhamnose residue.To enhance the cutaneous permeability of phosphoramidon,we synthesized a derivative (designated here as NPLT) byreplacing the hydrophilic rhamnose residue with a phenethylresidue (Tsuji et al ., 2001). NPLT was the best suitedderivative tested and was able to inhibit skin fibroblastelastase significantly, with an IC50of 50 n M, but it did notaffect the activity of neutrophil elastase or collagenases Type Ior Type IV (Figure 2) (Tsuji et al., 2001).
50of 50 n M, but it did notaffect the activity of neutrophil elastase or collagenases Type Ior Type IV (Figure 2) (Tsuji et al., 2001).To determine whether NPLT inhibits elastase in mouseskin, UVB-exposed and non-exposed mouse skin wasexamined for elastase activity in vitro . The elastase activitystimulated by UVB irradiation was reduced significantlyby NPLT, to a level similar to that of non-irradiatedmouse skin in a dose-dependent manner (Tsuji et al .,2001). This indicates that NPLT can inhibit UVB-inducibleelastase activity and that the enhanced elastase activity inUVB-exposed skin is associated with an NPLT-sensitivemetalloprotease. When NPLT was applied daily for 18 weeksat a concentration of 1 mMto the dorsal skin of hairless mice,immediately after each suberythemal UVB irradiation, thewrinkle formation was diminished significantly comparedwith ethanol-treated controls (Tsuji et al ., 2001).

treatment with a UVB sunscreen (p-MCX) had no effect.Comparison of wrinkle scores in that study revealed thatNPLT suppressed wrinkle formation significantly after 15 to18 weeks of irradiation, compared with ethanol-treatedcontrols. In contrast, similar treatment with the UVBsunscreen p-MCX had no suppressive effect, indicating thatthe sunscreen effect played no role in the prevention ofwrinkle formation by NPLT. This study, using a specificinhibitor of skin fibroblast elastase, revealed that theenhanced activity of skin fibroblast elastases from UVBradiation is involved primarily in the loss of skin elasticity andsubsequent wrinkle formation.To assess how wrinkle formation, loss of skin elasticity,and degeneration in the three-dimensional configuration ofelastic fibers are linked, we conducted a similar wrinklingstudy using rat hind limb skin at different concentrations ofthe skin fibroblast elastase inhibitor (Tsukahara et al., 2001b).
When NPLT was applied topically for 6 weeks at variousconcentrations, 1 hour or 24 hours after each UVB exposure,wrinkle formation was remarkably suppressed at concentra-tions of NPLT greater than 0.5 mMcompared with ethanol-treated controls (Figure 3) (Tsukahara et al ., 2001b). Incontrast, similar treatment with a UVB sunscreen (p-MCX) didnot suppress wrinkle formation, indicating little involvementof a sunscreen effect. When assessed by image analysis ofskin replicas, NPLT treatment reduced wrinkle formationsignificantly at concentrations greater than 0.5 mM, reachinga plateau at concentrations greater than 1 m M, whereas theUVB sunscreen p-MCX had little suppressive effect. Inmeasurements of skin elasticity using a Cutometer, whereas6 weeks of UVB irradiation decreased skin elasticitymarkedly (expressed as the parameters, Ue, Uf, Ur, andUv), 6 weeks of treatment with NPLT after exposureprevented the decreases in skin elasticity at concentrationsgreater than 0.1 m
greater than 0.1 mM(for Ue, Uf, and Ur) or 1.0 m M(for Uv)(Tsukahara et al., 2001b). In contrast, similar treatment withthe UVB sunscreen p-MCX did not prevent the decrease inskin elasticity. In parallel, electron microscopic observationsof the three-dimensional structure of elastic fibers revealedthat although 6 weeks of UVB irradiation caused a markeddisruption of the three- dimensional structure of elastic fibers,treatment with NPLT after UVB exposure over the 6 weeksprevented the disruption of elastic fibers, at concentrationsgreater than 0.1 mM(Figure 4) (Tsukahara et al., 2001b). Incontrast, similar treatment with the UVB sunscreen p-MCX
did not prevent the disruption of elastic fibers. Quantitativemeasurements by image analysis of the disruption of elasticfibers based on elastic fiber linearity revealed that although 6weeks of UVB irradiation induced a distinct decrease inelastic fibers with a high linearity, 6 weeks of treatment withNPLT during that cumulative UVB exposure prevented thatdecrease, in a dose-dependent manner and at concentrationsgreater than 0.1 mM, reaching a plateau at concentrationsgreater than 1 m M. In contrast, similar treatment with the UVBsunscreen p-MCX did not prevent the decrease in elasticfibers, with high linearity. Thus, there is a close andsignificant interrelationship ( R240.9) among wrinkle forma-tion, elasticity, and elastic fiber linearity at differentconcentrations of NPLT (Figure 5).These NPLT inhibition studies suggest strongly that theenhanced elastase activity of dermal fibroblasts plays animportant role in the degeneration of elastic fibers followingUnirradiated/

UVB irradiation and that the loss of skin elasticity occurs as adirect result of the altered elastic fiber configuration, whichsubsequently triggers wrinkle formation. The inhibitory effectof NPLT on wrinkle formation was corroborated by a humanclinical study using an extract of Zingiber officinale (L.) Rose ,which is capable of inhibiting skin fibroblast elastase (with anIC50of 0.013%, residue weight percentage) but not neu-trophil elastase (Tsukahara et al ., 2006). A 1 year clinicalstudy (Tsukahara et al., 2004b; Imokawa, 2008) on humanfacial skin to determine the efficacy of the L. Rose extractdemonstrated that it inhibits UV-induced decreases in skinelasticity and prevents or improves wrinkle formation in skinaround the corners of the eyes without changing the watercontent of the stratum corneum. The subjects studied were 20healthy Japanese men with a mean age of 37.6 years(Tsukahara et al., 2004b). A 1% extract of Zingiber officinale
(L.) Rose or a placebo was applied topically to each half ofthe face in a double-blind manner twice daily for 12 months.Before and 12 months after the initiation of topical treatment,wrinkles were assessed visually, replicas were collected, andskin elasticity and water content of the stratum corneum weremeasured.

image analysis. After 1 year of topical application of theextract, the wrinkle score and the image analysis area ratio(%) of wrinkles and fine wrinkles had increased at the cornersof the eyes and at the lower eyelid areas on the placebo-treated side but were significantly less in those areas on theside of the face treated with the extract. Skin elasticity,evaluated in terms of Ur/Uf, had significantly decreased after1 year only on the placebo-treated side, and that decreasewas prevented on the extract-treated side. The water contentof the stratum corneum did not differ between the extract-and placebo-treated sides throughout the measurementperiod. These results suggest that the extract of Zingiberofficinale (L.)

Identification of skin fibroblast elastaseSkin fibroblast elastase is a 94 kDa membrane-boundtype metalloprotease with a neutral optimum pH (Szendriet al ., 1984; Schwartz et al ., 1986, 1988; Nakagawaet al., 1987; Godeau and Hornebeck, 1988; Homsy et al.,1988; Croute et al., 1991; Mecham et al., 1997). Althoughthere are several candidate enzymes for skin fibroblastelastase, such as 92, 72 kDa type IV collagenase, neutrophilelastase, cathepsin G and protease 3, none of thesehave properties which match the above characteristics.Recently, we observed similarities between fibroblastelastase and neutral endopeptidase (Fulcher et al., 1982) interms of their size (MW 97,000), both being membrane-bound metalloproteases, and in their inhibitory profiles.Immunoprecipitation and western blotting using anantibody to neutral endopeptidase revealed that skin fibro-blast elastase is identical to neutral endopeptidase (Moriwakiet al., 1995).
Biological mechanisms underlying UVB-induced upregulationof skin fibroblast elastaseAlthough the enhanced activity of neutral endopeptidase inskin fibroblasts may be responsible for a UVB-inducedcascade of biological events in which the degeneration ofelastic fibers reduces skin elasticity, which in turn leads towrinkle formation, little is known about the mechanism(s) bywhich skin fibroblast elastase activity in dermal fibroblasts isstimulated by UVB irradiation. Based on the poor penetration
of UVB into the dermis, the most plausible mechanism isthat UVB causes the production of a basementmembrane-permeable biological factor(s), which stimulatesthe expression of elastases by dermal fibroblasts. To test thishypothesis, we asked whether conditioned medium fromUVB-exposed human keratinocytes stimulates the geneexpression of matrix proteins or matrix metalloproteases inhuman fibroblasts (Imokawa, 2008) as follows: Real-timereverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR for neutral endopeptidasemRNA reveals that the conditioned medium from UVB-exposed keratinocytes stimulates gene expression for neutralendopeptidase at 4–6 hours and 24 hours post-incubation.Real-time RT-PCR for elastin mRNA reveals that conditionedy = 6.4032x + 34.984R2 = 0.8628102030405060102030405060TNF- α secretion (pg ml–1)y = 2.7347x + 46.036R2 = 0.2165ET-1 secretion (pg ml–1)Relationship between NEP and  IL-8 Relationship between NEP and IL-8

medium from UVB-exposed keratinocytes downregulates thegene expression of elastin at 4 hours post-incubation. Real-time RT-PCR for collagenase type I mRNA reveals that theconditioned medium from UVB-irradiated keratinocytesstimulates gene expression for collagenase type I at 4–12and 24 hours post-incubation. Real-time RT-PCR for collagenmRNA reveals that the conditioned medium from UVB-irradiated keratinocytes downregulates gene expression forcollagen only slightly at 12 and 24 hours post-incubation.Further, western blotting of conditioned medium-treatedfibroblasts reveals that the conditioned medium from UVB-exposed keratinocytes increases protein levels of neutralendopeptidase at 48 hours post-incubation. The abovefindings indicate that paracrine factors are secreted byUVB-exposed keratinocytes, which may penetrate into thedermis to trigger dermal fibroblasts to generate fibroblastelastase activity.In a comparison between in vivo profiles for matrix
proteins and proteases and in vitro cellular effects, it isevident that the effects of conditioned medium from UVB-irradiated keratinocytes on fibroblasts may mimic the in vivosituation for matrix proteins and proteases in wrinkled skin.This suggests that the enhanced activity of skin fibroblastelastase in UVB-irradiated skin is mediated by basementmembrane-permeable soluble factors secreted by keratino-cytes. These results support our hypothesis for a mechanismof wrinkle formation by which cytokines are released bykeratinocytes following UVB irradiation, triggering dermalfibroblasts to generate neutral endopeptidase. The neutralpeptidase results in deterioration of the three-dimensionalarchitecture of the elastic fibers, reducing skin elasticity, andeventually leading to the formation of wrinkles.Identification of keratinocyte-derived cytokines responsible forincreased gene expression of skin fibroblast elastaseTo determine which cyotokine(s) secreted from human
keratinocytes following UVB irrradiation are responsible forthe increased gene expression of skin fibroblast elastase, wecompared the gene expression of skin fibroblast elastase(measured by real-time RT-PCR) and levels of cytokinesreleased into the medium by UVB-exposed human keratino-cytes (HaCaT cells) at different UVB doses (Figure 6). Therewas a close correlation ( R240.75) between the secretedlevels of IL-1 aand GM-CSF and gene expression of theelastase, but no correlation with TNF a, IL-8, or ET-1. Thissuggests that both IL-1 aand GM-CSF may play roles involvedin the stimulated gene expression of skin fibroblast elastase(Imokawa, 2008), although additional studies are required toreach a final conclusion.Thus, we propose a UVB-induced wrinkling mechanism asfollows: Repetitive UVB exposure causes keratinocytes tosecrete IL-1 awhich triggers GM-CSF secretion in anautocrine fashion. Secreted IL-1 aand GM-CSF penetrate into
the dermis to stimulate the expression of skin fibroblastelastase, which then cleave elastic fibers surrounding thefibroblasts, leading to the deterioration of the three-dimen-sional configuration of elastic fibers. This results in a loss ofskin elasticity and subsequently to wrinkle formation.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors state no conflict of interest.REFERENCESAkazaki S, Imokawa G (2001) Mechanical methods for evaluating skinsurface architecture in relation to wrinkling.
