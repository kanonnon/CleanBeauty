Treatment X-linked protoporphyria ABSTRACT  Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) and X-linked protoporphyria (XLP) are characterized by skin photosensi -tivity caused by accumulation of protoporphyrin IX. We aimed to review the clinical evidence of efficacy and safety of skin photosensitivity treatments in individuals with EPP or XLP. We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. A total of 40 studies with data on 18 treatment modalities were included. Comprehensive treatment safety data were obtained from the European Medicines Agency and the United States Food and Drug Administration. The studies used different outcome measures to evaluate the sensitivity without a generally accepted method to assess treatment effect on skin photosensitivity. Of the included studies, 13 were controlled trials. Gathered, the trials showed moderate positive effect of inorganic
sunscreen application and subcutaneous implant of afamelanotide and no effect of organic sunscreen application, or oral treatment with beta-carotene, cysteine, N-acetylcysteine, vitamin C, or warfarin. Studies without control groups suggested treatment effect of foundation cream, dihydroxyacetone/lawsone cream, narrow-band ultra-violet B phototherapy, erythrocyte transfusion, extracorporeal erythrocyte photodynamic therapy, or oral treatment with zinc sulphate, terfenadine, cimetidine, or canthaxanthin, but the real effect is uncertain. Assessment of treatment effect on photosensitivity in patients with EPP or XLP carries a high risk of bias since experienced photosensitivity varies with both weather conditions, exposure pattern, and pigmentation. Controlled trials of promising treatment options are important although challenging in this small patient population.   1.Introduction Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) and X-linked protoporphyria
(XLP) are inherited cutaneous porphyrias characterized by skin photo -sensitivity [1]. Both diseases are caused by accumulation of the photo -active substance protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) [1]. PpIX accumulates as the result of altered activity of enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway due to genetic variants (illustrated in Fig. 1) [1,2] . PpIX accumulates in the red blood cells. Visible light penetrates the skin and is absorbed by the accumulated PpIX in the dermal blood vessels. This starts a photodynamic reaction causing vascular injury leading to PpIX release, erythema, inflammation, and severe pain (illustrated in Fig. 2A) [3,4] . Reduced light penetration through the skin and symptomatic treatment of photosensitivity may reduce discomfort of the patient. Photosensitivity worsens with increasing PpIX concen -tration [3,5,6] , and reducing the PpIX load is desirable. PpIX is excreted in the bile by the liver, with the potential risk of liver
damage from the increased PpIX load [5-8] . Treatment options for patients with EPP or XLP are very limited and more effective therapy is needed [9]. The present review aimed to provide an updated systematic evaluation of the clinical evidence of the
more effective therapy is needed [9]. The present review aimed to provide an updated systematic evaluation of the clinical evidence of the efficacy and safety of treatments for skin photosensitivity in individuals with EPP or XLP, providing an overview of tested treatments, treatment targets, study designs, outcome measures, and potential confounders, to aid and guide the research for future therapeutic interventions. *Corresponding author.

Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy 158 (2023) 11413222.Methods The systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic reviews [10,11] . The protocol for this review was registered prospectively in PROSPERO (CRD42022322568). With publication permissions figures were downloaded from Colourbox.dk or created with BioRender.com and modified in GIMP (Gimp.gov). 2.1. Eligibility criteria Inclusion criteria. (1) English-language study. (2) Containing data on treatment of skin photosensitivity in patients with EPP or XLP. (3) Assessment of at least one of our outcomes listed in Section 2.2. (4) The treatment must be described so it is repeatable. No restrictions were applied to intervention modality or study design. However, case series including less than 5 patients, non-human studies, and conference ab-stracts were excluded. Data were extracted from original articles not
from reviews. 2.2. Outcomes Our primary outcome was treatment efficacy assessed as change or difference in photosensitivity, sun habits, or erythrocyte PpIX level. Changes were defined as: comparing the situation of the patient before with the situation during treatment. Differences were defined as comparing placebo with active treatment. Photosensitivity and sun habits could be patient-reported or assessed by investigators. PpIX levels were measured. No restrictions were applied to data collection method. Our secondary outcome was safety, assessed through prevalence and severity of adverse events (AEs) as reported in the included studies. If studies reported results on multiple outcomes, all of these were included in the review. 2.3. Search strategy and study selection We systematically searched MEDLINE (via Ovid), Embase (via Ovid), the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov from database inception to
14th of June 2022. Subject headings as well as text words were used to catch all studies. A detailed description of the used search terms is available in Appendix Table A.1. Duplicates were removed using Men-deley (version 1.19.8, Mendeley, London, UK). An initial screening of titles, abstracts, and keywords was conducted to exclude obvious irrel-evant references using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The searches were complemented with a manual check of references from included articles. The final selection of studies was based on full-text assessment. 2.4. Data extraction Data were extracted from the included studies using a predefined collection form with the following parameters: first author; publication year; country; study design; number of participants who started and completed treatment; how the EPP or XLP diagnosis was established; treatment modality (including dose, timing, and duration); efficacy
outcome measures; efficacy data collection methods; results on efficacy; AEs; conflicts of interest; and funding. One author (IH) extracted data, and another author (CL) quality checked all extracted data. 2.5. Methodological quality assessment The studies were divided into interventional studies (treatment assigned by the investigator) and observational studies (treatment not assigned by the investigator). Interventional studies were sorted into the following categories: randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), non- randomized controlled clinical trials (NRCTs), and uncontrolled clinical trials (UCTs). Observational studies were divided into controlled and uncontrolled studies. Controlled observational studies (COS) may have used a parallel or crossover design. Observational studies without a control group were categorized as a case series (CS). The risk of bias for each RCT was assessed in accordance with
Cochrane ’s risk of bias tool [11]. This tool assesses bias in seven different domains (random sequence generation, allocation conceal -
Cochrane ’s risk of bias tool [11]. This tool assesses bias in seven different domains (random sequence generation, allocation conceal -ment, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other bias), with each domain being assessed as being at high, low, or unclear risk of bias, depending on the review author ’s judgement. Only RCT studies were risk-assessed. 2.6. Official drug labels Official drug labels for centrally approved medicines in the European Union (EU) were obtained from the website of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [12]. For approved medicines used in the included studies the label of the most recently marketed medical product in the EU containing only the relevant active substance was obtained. If no official label was available at the website of EMA the label was instead sought after on the website of the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency [13]. If no official label was
found here either, it was finally sought after on the website of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [14]. If no label was available from any of these sources, the treatment was noted as without an official label. All data on undesirable effects from official drug la-beling were obtained on 18th of August 2022. Subsequently, it was assessed whether the extracted AEs from the included studies were known undesirable effects reported on official drug labels. 3.Results 3.1. Study selection A PRISMA flowchart of the study selection process is available in Appendix Fig. The systematic searches yielded 2832 references from MEDLINE (1195), Embase (1581), the Cochrane Library (36), and ClinicalTrials.gov (20). The manual scanning of reference lists yielded 5 additional records. Subsequently, 911 duplicates were discarded. After screening of 1926 records by title, abstract, and keywords 103 Fig. 1.Heme synthesis. EPP and XLP are due to genetic variants causing

Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy 158 (2023) 1141323references were eligible for full-text analyses. Reasons for the exclusion of studies during full-text assessment are listed in Appendix Table A.2. A total of 38 references met the selection criteria and were included. Three references contained two studies each, providing 6 studies for inclusion [15–17]. Results from two studies have not been published in articles, but were reported in two references on ClinicalTrials.gov and in one “European Public Assessment Report ” by EMA [18–20]. Gathered, 38 references with a total of 40 studies were included in the present review. 3.2. Description of included studies and bias assessment Table 1 summarizes therapies, study designs, number of patients, treatment effects, and reported AEs of the 40 studies that met the eligibility criteria. A total of 8 studies were RCTs, 4 were NRCTs, 1 was a COS, 16 were UCTs, and 11 were CS. Intention-to-treat analysis of the
results were performed in 3 studies [18–21]. All other included studies presented the treatment effect based only on those patients who completed the treatment. A total of 1114 treatment courses were started and of these 1061 were completed. Predominantly, patients were diag-nosed with EPP. Only two studies included a total of 8 patients with XLP [22,23] . In the included studies, 18 unique treatment modalities were eval-uated: application of inorganic or organic sunscreen [17], subcutaneous implant of afamelanotide [18–22,24 –28], dihydroxyacetone/lawsone application [29], foundation application [30], narrow-band ultraviolet (UV) B phototherapy [31,32] , erythrocyte transfusion [33], extracor -poreal erythrocyte photodynamic therapy [34], or oral treatment with beta-carotene [16,35 –42], cysteine [15,43,44] , N-acetylcysteine [45, 46], vitamin C [47], warfarin [48], zinc sulphate [49,50] , terfenadine [16], cimetidine [51], isoniazid [23], or canthaxanthin [52].

Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy 158 (2023) 1141326reported photosensitivity was the most frequent outcome, collected from 31 studies. Studies measuring photosensitivity for assessment of efficacy (n=14) used phototesting for this purpose. Patient-reported sun habits, PpIX level, and dosimeter measured sun habits were used by 6, 13, and 1 study, respectively. One study assessed none of the ef-ficacy outcomes but reported on safety outcomes [25]. A total of 28 studies reported on safety. Extended characteristics of included studies with information on publication year, first author, location, diagnostic method, conflicts of interest, and funding are presented in Appendix Table A.4. Due to the wide heterogeneity of the included studies a meta-analysis was not conducted. The 8 included RCTs were evaluated with the Cochrane ’s risk of bias tool. Results are shown in Appendix Table A.5. The RCTs had a high risk
of performance bias due to lack of blinding of participants and health -care personnel. In addition, 6 of the RCTs used crossover design with high risk of systematic bias. 3.3.

A wide variety of other AEs including, nausea, headache, dizziness, and increased serum alanine transaminase, were reported. Other AEs were extracted from each study and presented in Table 1. Implant afamelanotide, tablet cimetidine, tablet isoniazid, tablet N- acetylcysteine, tablet vitamin C, tablet warfarin, and sunscreens con-taining octinoxate or titanium dioxide, and tablet zinc are approved drugs in EU and/or in the US carrying official drug labels. For these 9 treatments all reported AEs in the included studies were also found in the corresponding official drug label. Drug label sources are presented in Appendix Table A.6. Dihydroxyacetone cream and iron oxide in foun-dation were categorized as cosmetics without an official drug label. Tablet beta-carotene and cysteine were categorized as supplements which allowed them to be marked without an official drug label. Tablet
terfenadine is withdrawn from the European and American market and has no official drug label. Tablet canthaxanthin is not approved and consequently has no official drug label. Lawsone is not approved for skin application by FDA or EU and have no drug label. Narrow-band UVB phototherapy, erythrocyte transfusion, and extracorporeal erythrocyte photodynamic therapy are not pharmaco -logical treatments and have no drug labels. Known short-term AEs of narrow-band UVB phototherapy are erythema and skin dryness. Long- term AE include photoaging and potential photocarcinogenesis [53, 54]. Iron overload, infections, and immunologic transfusions reactions are known risks of transfusions [55,56]. Erythrocyte photodynamic therapy is only described in the included article [34]. 3.4. Treatment effect summarized by treatment modality 3.4.1. Sunscreens Topical application of sunscreen, dihydroxyacetone, lawsone, and
foundation were suggested to reduce the penetration of light to dermis [17,29,30]. Single application (2mg/cm2) of inorganic (18% titanium dioxide) or organic sunscreen were tested in a NRCT, where 7 patients had their photosensitivity measured on unprotected skin and after sunscreen application [17]. The inorganic sunscreen provided decreased photo -sensitivity in all patients with a median protection factor of 2 compared to unprotected skin. The organic sunscreen did not change the measured photosensitivity. An UCT investigated the change in photosensitivity by application of foundation (containing octinoxate, titanium dioxide, and iron oxide) once or twice per day for 6 month in 23 patients [30]. Most (78%) re-ported decreased photosensitivity by foundation application while 22% reported unchanged photosensitivity. Dihydroxyacetone (6%) and lawsone (0.25%) cream were investi -gated in another UCT of 7 patients and all patients reported decreased
photosensitivity during treatment [29]. 3.4.2. Afamelanotide Afamelanotide is an analogue of alfa-melanocyte-stimulating hor-mone that increases the pigmentation of epidermis to reduce light penetration [21]. Nine studies on treatment with a subcutaneous implant of afamelanotide were included being three RCTs [18–21], one COS [28], two UCTs [24,26], and three CS [22,25,27]. In one study an implant contained 20mg afamelanotide [24]. In the remaining studies, one implant contained 16mg afamelanotide. The implant was given as a single dose or given several times with intervals down to 60 days. One CS suggested decreased PpIX load during treatment [22]. The remaining studies did not report PpIX levels during treatment. Pigmentation of the skin is an effect of afamelanotide which makes definitive blinding of participants and investigators impossible [24]. The 3 RCTs reported conflicting results. One found a decrease in reported as well as measured
photosensitivity by afamelanotide with an estimated difference between
conflicting results. One found a decrease in reported as well as measured photosensitivity by afamelanotide with an estimated difference between afamelanotide and placebo of 8 additionally minutes direct sunlight exposure per day without pain [20,21]. Another RCT found no difference in reported photosensitivity or sun habits between afamela -notide and placebo group [18,20]. The last RCT reported increased sun exposure while receiving afamelanotide [19,20]. The one included COS measured sun habits among a total of 26 patients with EPP who them -selves had chosen to be on or off treatment with afamelanotide. The COS found patients on treatment were more exposed to visible light than patients off treatment [28]. All studies without control groups suggested decreased photosensitivity during afamelanotide treatment compared to off treatment periods [24,26,27]. 3.4.3. Beta-carotene Beta-carotene is a precursor of vitamin A. Deposition of beta-
carotene in the skin gives it a yellow orange coloration, making defini -tive blinding of participants and investigators difficult [35,36,38,42]. Color in the skin from the beta-carotene is suggested to reduce pene-tration of light. Nine studies on treatment with oral beta-carotene were included: one crossover RCT [38], 4 UCTs [16,35,37,42], and 4 CS [36,39–41]. Dos-ages of oral beta-carotene varied both within and among studies be-tween 15mg and 300mg daily. Each beta-carotene treatment course lasted more than 2 months and the majority more than 4 months. The crossover RCT included 11 patients and found no difference in patient-reported photosensitivity or sun habits between 100mg beta- carotene daily for 4 months and placebo [38]. The studies without control groups have completed a total of 231 treatments measuring patient-reported change in photosensitivity dur-ing treatment [16,35–37,39–42]. Of these 85% of patients reported
decreased photosensitivity, 15% reported minimal or no change in photosensitivity, while no one reported worsening during treatment. Two studies investigated the PpIX load during treatment and found it unchanged by beta-carotene [35,40]. 3.4.4. Cysteine or N-acetylcysteine N-acetylcysteine is a prodrug of the antioxidant cysteine proposed to have anti-inflammatory properties in the skin [57]. Three RCTs [43,45, 46], one NRCT [15], and two UCTs [15,44] investigated oral cysteine [15,43,44] or N-acetylcysteine [45,46] for treatment of skin photosen -sitivity. All controlled studies were performed in a crossover design where each patient received treatment and placebo serially. Cysteine was administered daily in a dose of 1000 mg, N-acetylcysteine in a daily dose of 1800 mg. Cysteine provided a decrease in measured photosensitivity (protec -tion factor of 2) in a double blinded RCT of 15 EPP patients. However,
patients reported no difference in photosensitivity between placebo and cysteine [43]. In addition, cysteine was tested in a NRCT where all pa-tients received placebo in the first study period in June or July while receiving cysteine later in the summer [15]. No control for seasonal effect was conducted and 60% of patients experienced least photosen -sitivity during cysteine treatment. In the two UCTs of cysteine, 13 and 29 patients were examined respectively [15,44]. Out of the 42 patients 81% reported decreased photosensitivity during treatment, 14% unchanged photosensitivity, and 5% increased photosensitivity. The studies of N-acetylcysteine did not find any difference in PpIX level or in reported or measured photosensitivity between N-acetylcys -teine and placebo [45,46]. 3.4.5. Other supplements One double-blind crossover RCT has investigated the effect of 1g oral vitamin C daily and found no difference in photosensitivity between vitamin C and placebo [47].

vitamin C and placebo [47]. Two uncontrolled studies investigated the effect of 4 months oral treatment with the antioxidant zinc sulphate [49,50]. One study pre-scribed 400mg zinc sulphate daily. 33% of patients reported decreased photosensitivity from this treatment [49]. The second study used 600mg daily. 71% reported decreased photosensitivity [50]. No I.M. Heerfordt et al.
Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy 158 (2023) 1141328patients reported increased photosensitivity during the zinc treatment. Oral canthaxanthin (4,4-diketo-beta-carotene) was tested in a single UCT of 7 patients [52]. After treatment with canthaxanthin 50–200mg daily for between 7 and 16 months, 86% of patients reported decreased photosensitivity. No difference in PpIX level was found. 3.4.6. Antihistamines Antihistamines are suggested to alleviate symptoms of photosensi -tivity [16]. Patients (n=7) had their photosensitivity measured before and after two days of treatment with oral terfenadine 120–240mg daily. The treatment decreased the flare reaction produced by phototesting in all patients [16]. Treatment with oral cimetidine 800mg to 1600 mg daily provided a median decrease in PpIX level of 20% after 4 months treatment in a CS of 15 patients [51]. Of patients 73% reported decreased photosensitivity. No patients reported increased photosensitivity. 3.4.7. Warfarin
3.4.7. Warfarin One single-blind crossover RCT including 5 patients with EPP has investigated the effect of oral warfarin [48]. No significant difference in patient-reported photosensitivity or PpIX level was found. 3.4.8. Isoniazid The potential of reducing PpIX load by oral isoniazid has been tested in a single study. The level of PpIX was measured in 15 patients before and after treatment with isoniazid for 8 weeks [23]. No change in PpIX level was found. 3.4.9. Phototherapy and blood therapy Three non-pharmacologic treatment modalities have been tested in 4 CS. Two CS from the United Kingdom described treatment with narrow- band UVB phototherapy with doses between 0.04 and 0.978 J per cm2 skin to increase pigmentation [31,32] . Patients were treated with pho-totherapy 7–20times per summer. Most patients (76%) reported decreased photosensitivity. No patients reported increased photosensi -tivity. Five patients were phototested, showing a decreased photosen -
sitivity [32]. In a CS of 7 patients blood was taken from the patient ’s circulation for extracorporeal red light inactivation of PpIX before returning the blood to the patient [34]. Erythrocyte PpIX was reduced with a mean of approximately 30% just after treatment. In the first days after treatment 71% experienced increased photosensitivity. Subsequently, all 7 pa-tients reported decreased photosensitivity. Another CS treated 5 patients with erythrocyte transfusions every 5–6 weeks to reduce PpIX load [33]. One months after transfusion the PpIX level was reduced with a mean of 70% and all patients reported decreased photosensitivity. 4.Discussion This review included 13 controlled trials showing moderate positive effects of inorganic sunscreen application and implanted afamelanotide and no effect of organic sunscreen application, or oral treatment with beta-carotene, cysteine, N-acetylcysteine, vitamin C or warfarin on light
tolerance in patients with EPP or XLP [15,17 –21,28,43,45 –48]. Afa-melanotide is an analogue of alfa-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. It increases the production of eumelanin in epidermis which is an effective absorbent of light [21]. The inorganic sunscreen also provides photo -protection against visible light [58]. The rest of the included studies were conducted without control groups. These UCTs and CS suggested good effects of foundation cream, dihydroxyacetone/lawsone cream, narrow-band UVB phototherapy, erythrocyte transfusion, extracorporeal erythrocyte photodynamic therapy, or oral treatment with zinc sulphate, terfenadine, cimetidine, or canthaxanthin (see Table 1). Suggested therapeutic targets and mechanisms of action for each included treatment are presented in Fig. 2B. In theory, foundation, dihydroxyacetone, lawsone, and yellow deposit of canthaxanthin in the skin work by reducing penetration of
visible light through epidermis, protecting the dermal blood vessels [52,
deposit of canthaxanthin in the skin work by reducing penetration of visible light through epidermis, protecting the dermal blood vessels [52, 58,59] . Narrow-band UVB phototherapy provides increased thickness of the stratum corneum and pigmentation as photoprotection [31,32,60] . The rationale behind zinc sulphate treatment was to provide antioxidant protection to minimize the symptomatic reaction to light exposure through anti-inflammatory properties [49,50] . By their histamine re-ceptor blockade properties, the antihistamines terfenadine and cimeti -dine may alleviate the patients ’ symptoms of histamine-release in the skin during PpIX photoactivation [16,51] . In addition, cimetidine may lower PpIX production by delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS2) inhibition (see Fig. 1) [51]. Erythrocyte transfusion and extracorporeal erythrocyte photodynamic therapy aim to reduce the PpIX level by increased PpIX elimination [33,34] . However, existing uncontrolled
studies are at high risk of providing misleading evidence and needs validation. XLP is quite similar to EPP [2]. Both diseases are caused by PpIX accumulation, EPP because of ferrochelatase deficit, XLP due to increased activity of ALAS2 [1,2] . Consequently, treatment based on photoprotection and alleviation, aimed to lessen the light-induced re-action will probably work on both. As for lowering the PpIX level, dif-ferences are expected. The photosensitivity in patients with EPP or XLP varies, and their experiences largely depends, on weather, season, time of day, exposure in the days before, and skin pigmentation [6,61,62] , making it difficult to assess their sensitivity. Many patients report a decreased photosen -sitivity after repeated exposure during the summer [62]. This is consistent with the reported treatment effect of narrow-band UVB phototherapy [31,32] . In several studies patients were asked to test their
photosensitivity regularly throughout the study periods by exposing their skin to sunlight [47,50] . If patients increase their light exposure to test a new treatment, which they often do [50,51] , this exposure in itself may result in reduced photosensitivity. In addition, individual PpIX level is found to vary with the season and decreases by 8–20% during summer compared to winter which may also affect light tolerance [63, 64]. Evaluation of effect when treating erythropoietic photosensitivity is challenging. The included studies used heterogenous outcome efficacy measures making direct comparison and combination of results impos -sible, and no generally accepted method for efficacy assessment exists [65]. Besides skin photosensitivity hepatobiliary manifestations of EPP and XLP are found [61]. Protoporphyric hepatopathy is the most serious complication occurring in fewer than 5% of patients [7,61] . In addition,
patients have an increased risk of gallstones, anemia, vitamin D defi-ciency, and osteoporosis [61,66 –68]. Theoretically, reducing the PpIX load will lessen the risk of hepatobiliary manifestations. This is yet un-tested in clinical trials, and related pathology must be managed along -side the photosensitivity. Hematopoietic cell transplantation is a curative treatment modality [69]. Due to the high morbidity and mortality rates of this procedure, it has never been tried in a clinical study, only used in single cases with severe liver disease [69]. Possible curative treatment by gene therapy is in pre-clinical testing [70–72]. The severe pain caused by photoactivated PpIX in the skin is well known from photodynamic therapy using topical delivery of PpIX in patients without EPP or XLP [73,74] . Pain alleviation by systemic and topically applied analgesia have been tried without effect [74]. A decreased PpIX level, cooling, inorganic sunscreen, and foundation have
been shown to reduce inflammation in PpIX photodynamic therapy [74, 75].
decreased PpIX level, cooling, inorganic sunscreen, and foundation have been shown to reduce inflammation in PpIX photodynamic therapy [74, 75]. No studies of the effect of clothing, window tinting, or seeking shade have been included in this review. These are, however, necessary and useful strategies for patients with EPP or XLP [6,61] . Avoiding visible light, covering the skin with clothes, and seeking shade does prevent the I.M. Heerfordt et al.
Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy 158 (2023) 1141329occurrence of painful skin symptoms. The clinical evidence in this re-view suggests that application of inorganic sunscreen may provide protection by a factor of 2. The included European Public Assessment Report [20] estimated treatment with afamelanotide to increase the time of direct sunlight exposure without symptoms by about 8min per day compared to placebo. Accordingly, the patient who can stay out-doors unprotected for just 15min at midday without symptoms can remain outdoors for 30min before symptoms occur if applying inor-ganic sunscreen (2mg/cm2), or 23min with afamelanotide. Patients with EPP or XLP will need to avoid visible light as their photosensitivity can only be treated minimally, placing large restrictions on lifestyle and work opportunities. More effective treatment is wanted. The review provides an overview of tested treatments, treatment targets,
study designs and potential confounders, to establish a stronger foun-dation for future therapeutic research of skin photosensitivity treatments.
