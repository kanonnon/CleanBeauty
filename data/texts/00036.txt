However, no study has investigated the ul traviolet properties of naturalfabrics dyed with natural colorants. This study reports the Ultraviolet Pr otection Factor (UPF) ofcotton fabrics dyed wi th colorants of plant and insect origins.Methods: Three cotton fabrics were dyed with three natural colorants. Fabrics werecharacterized with respect to fa bric construction, weight, thickn ess and thread count. Influence of
fabric characteristics on Ultravio let Protection Factor was studied. Role of colorant concentrationon the ultraviolet protection factor was examined via color strength analysis.Results: A positive correlation was ob served between the weight of the fabric and their UPFvalues. Similarly, thicker fabric s offered more protection from  ultraviolet rays. Thread countappears to negatively correlate wi th UPF. Dyeing with natural colo rants dramatically increased theprotective abilities of al l three fabric constructions. Addition ally, within the same fabric type UPFvalues increased with higher depths of shade.Conclusion: Dyeing cotton fabrics with natural colora nts increases the ul traviolet protectiveabilities of the fabrics and can be considered as an  effective protection again st ultraviolet rays. TheUPF is further enhanced with colorant of dark hue s and with high concentration of the colorant inthe fabric.Background
the fabric.BackgroundHigh, short-term exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR)from the sun causes sunburns and long-term exposureleads to skin cancer. The National Toxicology Program,U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has clas-sified UVR as a known human carcinogen [1]. The Ameri-can Cancer Society estimates that more than one millioncases of skin cancer cases are diagnosed each year in theUnited States [2]. In 2002, an estimated 54,200 new casesof melanoma skin cancer alone were diagnosed [2]. A pri-mary reason for the increased incidence of skin cancers isattributed to ozone depletion. Each one percent decreasein ozone concentration is predicted to increase the rate ofskin cancer by two percent to five percent [3]. The UnitedStates Environmental Protection Agency estimates thatozone depletion will lead to between three and fifteenmillion new cases of skin cancer in the United States bythe year 2075. Other reasons for the skin cancer epidemic
can be traced to lifestyle changes such as excessive expo-sure to sunlight during leisure activities, for example,Published: 27 October 2004BMC Dermatology  2004, 4:15 doi:10.1186/1471-5945-4-15Received: 09 July 2004Accepted: 27 October 2004This article is available from: http ://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-5945/4/15© 2004 Sarkar; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

In the case ofagricultural and other outdoor workers, exposure to thesun is an occupational hazard as they have no choiceabout the duration of their exposure to the sun [3-5].The ultraviolet radiation (UVR) band consists of threeregions: UV-A (320 to 400 nm), UV-B (290 to 320 nm),and UV-C (200 to 290 nm). UV-C is totally absorbed bythe atmosphere and does not reach the earth. UV-A causeslittle visible reaction on the skin but has been shown todecrease the immunological response of skin cells [3].UV-B is most responsible for the development of skin can-cers [3].Other than drastically reducing exposure to the sun, themost frequently recommended form of UV protection isthe use of sunscreens, hats, and proper selection of cloth-
ing. Unfortunately, one cannot hold up a textile materialto sunlight and determine how susceptible a textile is toUV rays. Even textiles which seem to be non-light trans-mitting may pass significant amounts of erythema-induc-ing UV irradiation [4]. Therefore, knowledge of the factorsthat contribute to the protective abilities of textiles is vital.Important factors include fiber composition, fabric con-struction and wet-processing history of the fabric such ascolor and other finishing chemicals that may have beenapplied to the textile material.To the author's knowledge, no study has investigated theultraviolet properties of natural fabrics dyed with naturalcolorants. A plethora of previous studies have concludedthat good UVR protection can be provided by syntheticfibers dyed with high concentrations of synthetic dyes.However, synthetic fibers such as polyester are hydropho-bic and are generally not deemed to be comfortable for
wear especially in warm weather. According to a report inAmerica's Textile Industries [6] natural fibers are back indemand. The emergence and popularity of a more naturalway of life as reflected in a return to organic farming andnatural foods has now extended into textiles where theresurgence of natural fibers and natural dyes is on theincrease [6,7]. It is hoped that data from the present studywill be useful for dermatologists advising patients regard-ing the UV-protective properties of clothing made fromnatural fibers and dyed with natural colorants.In this study, cotton fabrics were dyed with three naturalcolorants of plant and insect origin. Fabrics were charac-terized with respect to fabric construction, weight, thick-ness and thread count. Ultraviolet Protection Factor(UPF) was measured using a labsphere® UV-100 F Ultravi-olet Transmission Analyzer. The effect of colorant concen-
tration on the ultraviolet protection factor was examinedvia color strength analysis using a HunterLab ColorQuestXE® spectrophotometer.MethodsThree fabrics were chosen to cover the gamut of basicweave constructions. They were a bleached, mercerizedplain weave cotton fabric, a bleached mercerized cottontwill and a desized and bleached cotton sateen. Fabricweight was measured according to ASTM Test MethodD3776-96 [8]. Fabric thickness was measured accordingto ASTM Test Method D1777-96 [8]. Thread counts weremeasured according to ASTM D3775-98 [8].Natural plant colorants used were madder ( Rubia tincto-rum) and indigo ( Indigofera tinctoria ) and the natural col-orant of insect origin was cochineal ( Dactylopius coccus ).Since natural dyes do not have affinity for cellulosic fibersan alum mordant was used to impart affinity. Fabrics weremordanted prior to dyeing by treating with alum at boilfor 45 minutes. The liquor ratio was 1:40 and alum con-
centration was 10% on weight of the fabric. After mor-danting, fabric was squeezed thoroughly and dyed.Madder and cochineal dyeings were done in stainless steel
centration was 10% on weight of the fabric. After mor-danting, fabric was squeezed thoroughly and dyed.Madder and cochineal dyeings were done in stainless steelcanisters of an Atlas launder-ometer using 2%, 4% and6% dye on weight of fabric. The liquor-goods ratio was40:1. Fabrics were introduced into the dyeing solutions atroom temperature. Temperature was raised to the boil anddyeing continued at the boil for 60 minutes. After dyeing,fabrics were rinsed in deionized water, washed using anon-ionic detergent and air-dried. Three replications weredone for each colorant and at each dye concentration.Dyeing with indigo was done in the following manner.Indigo dye was made into a paste and solubilized usingsodium hydroxide and sodium hydrosulfite. Fabrics wereintroduced into dyebaths containing 2%, 4% and 6% dyeon weight of fabric. The liquor-goods ratio was 40:1. Afterthirty minutes of dyeing the fabrics were removed and oxi-
dized by drying in air. The fabrics were then rinsed indeionized water and washed using a non-ionic detergentand dried.Direct and diffuse UV transmittance through a fabric is thecrucial factor determining the UV protection of textiles[9]. Ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) is the scientificterm used to indicate the amount of Ultraviolet (UV) pro-tection provided to skin by fabric. UPF values are analo-gous to SPF values the only distinction being that SPFvalues for sunscreens are determined through human test-ing whereas UPF values are based on instrumental meas-urements [10]. UPF is defined as the ratio of the averageeffective UV irradiance calculated for unprotected skin tothe average UV irradiance calculated for skin protected bythe test fabric [5,10]. The higher the value, the longer a

An effective UVR dose (ED) forunprotected skin is calculated by convolving the incidentsolar spectral power distribution with the relative spectraleffectiveness function and summing over the wavelengthrange 290-400 nm. The calculation is repeated with thespectral transmission of the fabric as an additional weight-ing to get the effective dose (EDm) for the skin when it isprotected. The UPF is defined as the ratio of ED to EDmand calculated as follows [11]:where:Eλ = erythemal spectral effectivenessSλ = solar spectral irradiance in Wm-2nm-1Tλ = spectral transmittance of fabric∆λ = the bandwidth in nmλ = the wavelength in nmUPF's were measured in vitro using a labsphere® UV-100 FUltraviolet Transmission Analyzer according to standard
AS/NZ 4399:1996 [12]. Fabrics with a UPF value in therange 15 – 24 were classified as having "Good UV Protec-tion"; when the UPF values were between 25 and 39 fab-rics were classified as having "Very Good UV Protection"and "Excellent UV Protection" classification was usedwhen the UPF was 40 or greater [13]. In no event was afabric assigned a UPF rating greater than 50.Measured UPF values were also correlated to the colorstrength of the dyed fabrics. Color strength was evaluatedusing K/S values generated by a HunterLab ColorQuest XEdiffuse/8° spectrophotometer. K/S is a function of colordepth and is represented by the equation of Kubelka andMunk (Equation 2). Higher the value of K/S greater is thecolor strength [14,15].where R is the reflectance of the dyed fabric; K is the sorp-tion coefficient, and S is the scattering coefficient. Thespectrophotometer was standardized for a 1 inch diameterspecimen viewing aperture in reflectance – specular
included mode. Illuminant D65 and CIE 10-degreeobserver were used. During measurements, fabric sampleswere held flat and securely using a spring-loaded sampleclamp. Three measurements were taken on each dyed fab-ric with the fabric rotated between measurements.Results and discussionFabric characterization parameters and UPF values priorto dyeing are listed in Table 1. Based on the classificationparameters referenced previously the plain weave fabricand the sateen weave fabric cannot be rated as offeringany degree of protection since their UPF values were lessthan 15. The undyed twill weave fabric with a UPF of 19.2is rated as having Good UV Protection. The UPF values ofthe undyed fabrics can be explained in terms of fiber com-position and fabric construction. In terms of fiber compo-sition it is known that undyed bleached cotton, linen,acetate, and rayon fabrics afford poor protection againstUV radiation [16]. Fabric construction parameters of
weight and thickness show a positive correlation with UPFvalues. Higher the weight and thicker the fabric, higher isthe degree of protection afforded by the fabric. Accord-ingly, the twill weave fabric with a weight of 235 g/m2 anda thickness of 0.069 centimeters has the highest UPF valuefollowed by the sateen weave fabric which weighed 235 g/m2 and was 0.061 centimeters thick. The plain weave fab-ric with a weight of 120 g/m2 and a thickness of 0.035 cen-timeters offers no protection against transmittance of UVrays. The positive correlation between fabric weight andfabric thickness with UPF values can be explained withreference to porosity. Porosity is a measure of tightness ofweave and is also called as Coverfactor. Cover factor isdefined as the percentage area occupied by warp and fill-ing yarns in a given fabric area [4,17]. The closer theweave, the more is the percentage area occupied by theyarns and more opaque is the fabric to UV radiation.
Cover factor is increased by an increase in weight per unit
weave, the more is the percentage area occupied by theyarns and more opaque is the fabric to UV radiation.Cover factor is increased by an increase in weight per unitarea. Heavier fabric minimizes UV transmission by virtueof having smaller spaces between yarns thus blockingmore radiation [3,17]. A related variable is thickness.Thicker, denser fabrics transmit less UV radiation andhave a higher cover factor [10]. The data also reveals a neg-ative correlation between thread count and UPF. Higherthe thread count, lower is the degree of protectionafforded by the fabric. The plain weave fabric with athread count of 205 had a UPF of 3.2 whereas the twillweave fabric with a thread count of 81 had a UPF of 19.2with the sateen weave between the two with a threadcount of 106 and a UPF of 13.3. A possible explanationfor the negative correlation between thread count andUPF is the fact that fabrics that are thinner tend to contain
finer yarns and therefore have the highest thread counts[10]. In other words thickness and thread count areinversely correlated a point substantiated by the values inTable 1.UPFEDEDESESTmnmnmnmnm==∑∑λλλλλλλ∆∆290400290400Equation 1KSRR=−()122Equation 2

It is noted that since the relative erythemal spec-tral effectiveness is higher in the UV-B region compared tothe UV-A region, the UPF values depend primarily ontransmission in the UV-B region. Undyed plain weave fab-ric had significant transmittance and consequently a verylow UPF value of 3.8. UPF values and protection catego-ries of the plain weave fabric dyed with the different col-orants are listed in Table 2.

[18] who showed that pale colored fabricsof cotton, silk, polyamide, and polyamide/elastan gaveless protection against intense UV radiation. The resultsalso show that UPF values for colorants applied at higherconcentrations gave higher UPF values. For example, theUPF of the plain weave fabric at a 2% indigo on weight offabric was 43.1 and that increased to greater than UPF 50at an indigo concentration of 6%. We agree with Gies etal. [11] who indicated that dyeing fabrics in deeper shadesand darker colors improves sun protection properties.Thus although the studies by Reinert at al. and Gies et al.were done with synthetic dyes their conclusions seem tohold with natural colorants as well.
hold with natural colorants as well.The K/S values of the dyed fabrics which are a measure ofcolor depth seem to support the claim that higher colordepths increases UPF values. For example, in the case ofthe madder dyed samples when the K/S value increasedfrom 0.20 to 0.38 the UPF values rose from 11.1 to 16.6.However, the relationship of K/S with UPF is limited tothe same fabric type and the results cannot be generalizedacross fabrics of different weave structures. A primary rea-son for this observation is the acknowledgement that UPFvalues are dependent on a multitude of fabric construc-tion factors such as pores in the fabric, thickness, andweight in addition to processing parameters such as dye-ing and finishing. Another probable reason is the depend-ence of K/S on the absorbing properties of colorants in thevisible region of the spectrum and that may not influencethe absorption characteristics of colorants in the UVregion.
region.The percent UV transmittance data in the presence andabsence of colorants for the twill weave fabric is shown inFigure 2. UPF values and protection categories for thedyed twill weave fabric are shown in Tables 3. The twillweave fabric which prior to dyeing was rated as offeringGood UV Protection moved to the Excellent UV Protec-tion classification irrespective of the colorant and the con-centration of the dye used. Again, it was found that darkcolors within the same fabric type transmit less UV radia-tion than light colors and consequently have higher UPFs.Table 4 shows the UPF values and protection categoriesfor the dyed sateen weave fabric. The percent UV transmit-tance data in the presence and absence of colorants for thesateen weave fabric is shown in Figure 3. The increase inUPF values of the sateen weave dyed fabrics was dramaticin the sense that the sateen which prior to dyeing couldnot be rated (UPF < 15) achieved the Excellent UV Protec-
tion classification by virtue of its UPF values increasing bymore than a factor of four (UPF > 50). This result was truefor all colorants and at all dye concentrations. Again, aswas the case with the dyed plain weave fabric, the colorstrength (K/S) of the cochineal and indigo dyed twill andsateen fabrics were higher than the color strength of themadder dyed fabrics conclusively establishing that indigoand cochineal colorants resulted in deeper colors on thefabrics.ConclusionsFabric weight and thickness are important predictors ofUPF values for undyed cotton fabrics. In general, it wasfound that increase in weight and thickness increased theUPF though the relationship was not linear. UPF ofundyed fabrics was significantly enhanced by dyeing withnatural colorants especially for fabrics such as the plainweave and the sateen weave fabrics that displayed no pro-tective abilities in the undyed state. The degree of protec-tion imparted after dyeing was a function of the
tion imparted after dyeing was a function of theconcentration of the colorant in the fabric. Within thesame fabric type, as the percentage depth of shade
tion imparted after dyeing was a function of theconcentration of the colorant in the fabric. Within thesame fabric type, as the percentage depth of shadeincreased so did the UPF values. In addition, darker colorssuch as indigo provide better protection on account ofhigher UV absorption. Based on the results of this study itcan be theorized that plain, twill or sateen weave cottonfabrics dyed with natural colorants can provide good pro-tection against ultraviolet rays with the only conditionbeing that either the color has to be a dark hue or the con-centration of the colorant in the fabric has to be high.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competinginterests.Authors' contributionsAKS conceived the study, carried out the dyeing and test-ing and drafted the manuscript.AcknowledgementsThis research was supported by the U.
