Telomere-Mediated Effects on Melanogenesis and SkinAgingBarbara A. Gilchrest1, Mark S. Eller1and Mina Yaar1UV-induced melanogenesis (tanning) and ‘‘prematureaging’’ or photoaging result in large part from DNAdamage. This article reviews data tying both pheno-mena to telomere-based DNA damage signaling anddevelops a conceptual framework in which bothresponses may be understood as cancer-avoidanceprotective mechanisms.Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings (2009) 14,25–31; doi:10.1038/jidsymp.2009.9TELOMERE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONTelomeres are repeats of the short-base sequence, TTAGGG,and its complement in all mammalian species, at the ends ofeach chromosome (Morin, 1989; Greider, 1996). In humancells, telomeres are approximately 8,000–10,000 bp in lengthwith a single-stranded TTAGGG overhang of 100– 400 baseson the 30end (Stewart et al., 2003). Telomeres do not encode
genes, but rather prevent chromosome ends from beingrecognized as double-strand breaks (Blackburn, 2001).Moreover, because of the end-replication problem, bases atthe very tip of each chromosome are lost with each round ofcell division (Harley et al ., 1990; Blackburn, 1991; Levyet al ., 1992). This progressive telomere shortening, to acritically short length, has been shown to be responsible forthe Hayflick limit (Harley et al., 1990), the finite number ofcell divisions that may occur before a cell enters thepermanently non-dividing state termed replicative senes-cence (Hayflick, 1965, 1977). Hence, telomeres serve as abiological clock (Ishikawa, 2000; Bekaert et al ., 2005).Finally, work from several laboratories has shown thattelomeres play an important role in triggering DNA damageresponses (Karlseder et al., 1999; Harrington and Robinson,2002; Li et al ., 2005; Zhang et al ., 2007), although thephysiological role of this telomere-based signaling is as yetpoorly understood.
The telomere normally exists as a loop structure in whichthe 30overhang inserts back into the proximal duplextelomere and is held in place by various binding proteins,most critically by the telomere repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2)(van Steensel et al ., 1998; Griffith et al ., 1999). If cells aretreated with a dominant-negative TRF2 (TRF2DN), whichsequesters away wild-type TRF2, the loop opens, thetelomere linearizes, and the 30overhang is digested (vanSteensel et al ., 1998; Karlseder et al ., 1999). During thisprocess, the ATM kinase is activated, which in turn activatesthe p53 transcription factor and tumor suppressor protein,leading to senescence or apoptosis of the treated cells (vanSteensel et al., 1998; Karlseder et al., 1999). An experimentalremoval of the protection of telomeres-1 protein that bindsthe 30overhang sequence also induces these cellularresponses, but acts primarily through the ATR rather thanATM kinase (Denchi and de Lange, 2007).
PROBING THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLE OF TELOMERESOur group has shown that telomere homolog oligonucleo-tides, termed T-oligos, are a useful probe of telomerefunctions. T-oligos rapidly concentrate in the nucleus ofcultured cells (Eller et al ., 2002; Ohashi et al ., 2007; Yaaret al ., 2007), act at telomeres (Eller et al ., 2006b), and arepostulated to exaggerate innate signaling as detailed below,generating cell responses of potential therapeutic utility.We have proposed (Kosmadaki and Gilchrest, 2004;Gilchrest and Eller, 2005; Li et al ., 2005) that, in additionto experimental scenarios in which telomere-associatedproteins are manipulated, the telomere loop structure maybe disrupted as cells enter senescence, when the critically
to experimental scenarios in which telomere-associatedproteins are manipulated, the telomere loop structure maybe disrupted as cells enter senescence, when the criticallyshort telomere may create a stochastically unstable loop, or attimes of acute DNA damage, when introduction of basedamage or strand invasion by enzymes recruited to repair thedamage might lead to the exposure of TTAGGG repeats, asstrands separate or the loop itself is forced open (Figure 1).We further proposed that there is a nuclear sensor protein(subsequently identified as the Werner protein (Eller et al .,2006b): see below) that recognizes the TTAGGG repeatsequence, normally invisible within the loop structure,leading to activation of the ATM and ATR kinases, withsubsequent activation of p53 and other DNA damageresponse proteins, initiating the cellular responses of senes-cence or apoptosis (Eller et al., 2002, 2006b; Li et al., 2003,&2009 The Society for Investigative Dermatology www.jidonline.org 25REVIEW

2004; Puri et al., 2004; Ohashi et al., 2007; Yaar et al., 2007).Finally, we suggested that T-oligos similarly provideTTAGGG sequences to the sensor protein, activating thesame signaling pathway but allowing for more modulatedsignaling, at least in normal cells (Figure 1). We have nowexperimentally determined the pathway activated by T-oligosand have shown it to be consistent with the model.T-oligo treatment of normal or malignant cells activatesthe ATM kinase, autophosphorylating serine 1981 (Eller et al.,2003; Yaar et al., 2007), and also upregulates and activatesthe downstream effector protein, p53, and the p53 homolog,p73, p21, E2F1, p27, p33, and BRCA1, and the Fanconianemia protein, FANC D (Eller et al., 2002, 2007, 2008b; Liet al., 2003; Ruenger et al., 2007; Yaar et al., 2007). T-oligo-induced ATM activation also leads to modification of the p95Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein (Eller et al., 2003), inturn leading to an S-phase arrest. In addition to ATM, T-oligo
treatment activates the ATR kinase as indicated by phosphor-ylation of CHK1 and its downstream effector proteins (Elleret al ., 2006a). In malignant cells, a single T-oligo supple-mentation activates the above cascade and induces an S-phase arrest within 24 hours, which, within 72–96 hours,progresses to senescence, apoptosis, or autophagy, depend-ing on cell type (Eller et al., 2002; Li et al., 2004; Aoki et al.,2007; Ohashi et al., 2007; Yaar et al., 2007). Normal cellsactivate the same signaling pathways and enter an S-phasearrest within 24 hours, but, in contrast to their malignantcounterparts, resume exponential cell growth if providedwith fresh medium within 72–96 hours (Eller et al., 1997; Liet al ., 2004; Puri et al ., 2004; Yaar et al ., 2007). It isinteresting that within 24–48 hours of a single T-oligotreatment, normal cells also induce various protectiveresponses, as detailed below.Activation of the signaling cascade in at least some normal
and malignant cells requires WRN (Eller et al ., 2006b), theprotein mutated in the progeroid cancer-prone Wernersyndrome (Gray et al ., 1997), identifying an earlier unsus-pected role for WRN in telomere-based DNA damagesignaling. This interaction leads to the formation of ‘‘DNAdamage’’ foci, also termed telomere dysfunction-induced focior TIFs (Takai et al., 2003), which are known to occur as cellsenter senescence (Takai et al ., 2003; Herbig et al ., 2004).Such foci were recently definitively shown to occur in theabsence of DNA damage as a consequence of simplyretaining any of several DNA damage response proteins atchromatin sites in mammalian cells (Soutoglou and Misteli,2008) or in yeast (Bonilla et al., 2008). The T-oligo-inducedfoci form at telomeres (Eller et al ., 2006b) and, similar to
other foci that occur throughout the chromosome at times ofacute DNA damage (Lisby and Rothstein, 2004) or atundamaged DNA in the presence of DNA damage responseproteins (Soutoglou and Misteli, 2008), they contain thephosphorylated variant histone protein, gH2AX (Eller et al .,2006b), and multiple other proteins required for repair ofDNAdamageDNAdamageTelomereshorteningTelomereshortening3'3'5'5'3'3'5'5'3'3'5'5'3'3'5'5'ApoptosisApoptosis SenescenceSenescenceTRF2DNTRF2DNWRNWRNWRNAdaptivedifferentiation Adaptivedifferentiation ATMATRATMATRATMATRATMATR5'…TTAGGG…3'5'…TTAGGG…3'WRNWRNCellcyclearrestCellcyclearrestSenescenceSenescencesiPOT-1siPOT-1Figure 1 .Possible physiological mechanisms of telomere loop disruption: T-oligos as therapeutic alternative. Experimental disruption of the telomere loop byTRF2DNor siRNA directed against protection of telomeres-1 has been shown to cause senescence or apoptosis of treated cells, depending on cell type, mediate d
through ATM or ATR, respectively. We postulate that exposure of the TTAGGG repeat sequence on the 30telomere overhang, followed by interaction of the
through ATM or ATR, respectively. We postulate that exposure of the TTAGGG repeat sequence on the 30telomere overhang, followed by interaction of thesingle-stranded G-rich sequence with the Werner protein, WRN, is responsible for activating the kinases and for the subsequent cell responses. We fu rtherpostulate that critical telomere shortening as a result of multiple rounds of cell division causes the telomere loop to become stochastically unstab le,spontaneously opening and exposing the TTAGGG sequence, thereby activating the same signaling pathways. Acute DNA damage, expected to introduce bu lkyphotoproducts or modified DNA bases into the telomere loop structure, might also cause separation of the TTAGGG strand from its complement and/or ope n theloop structure, again activating the same signaling pathway. Treatment of cells or intact skin with T-oligos leads to rapid nuclear accumulation of t he TTAGGG
sequences, which then interact with WRN to activate the ATM and ATR kinases, as shown experimentally. Depending on the T-oligo dose and duration ofexposure, cells enter a cell cycle arrest and enhance production of DNA repair enzymes and differentiation-specific proteins. T-oligo-treated mal ignant cellsthen proceed to apoptosis or senescence, depending on cell type, although normal cells are far less likely to proceed to these biological end points.

DNA lesions (Eller et al., 2006b, 2007, 2008b). We postulatethat WRN recruits these multifunctional proteins that arecapable of mediating cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, differ-entiation, apoptosis, or senescence to sites of its interactionwith T-oligos and/or endogenous telomeric DNA, giving riseto various cell responses that are context-dependent andultimately protective of the organism’s genomic integrity.A T-OLIGO-INDUCED PROTECTIVE RESPONSE:TANNINGStudies in the early 1990s, directed at understanding themechanism of UV-induced tanning, first revealed a role fortelomere-based DNA damage signaling (mimicked andexaggerated by T-oligo treatment). A causative role forDNA damage in UV-induced tanning had been suggestedby studies in the 1980s, which showed that the actionspectrum for delayed tanning in human skin was essentiallyidentical to the action spectrum for UV-induced cyclobutanepyrimidine dimers (Parrish et al., 1982; Freeman et al., 1989).
In addition, treatment of human melanocytes with aliposome-encapsulated DNA repair enzyme, TN45, derivedfrom a bacterial phage, the only known action of which is toenhance excision of thymine dimers in UV-damaged DNA,stimulated melanogenesis (Gilchrest et al ., 1993). We hadtherefore examined the ability of thymidine dinucleotides(pTT), the obligate substrate for the most common UVphotoproduct, the thymine dimer (Setlow and Carrier,1966), to induce melanogenesis.Using a guinea pig model, we showed that topicalapplication of pTT repeatedly over 1–2 weeks led to increasedtyrosinase activity and epidermal melanin content, and to aclinical appearance identical to UV-induced tanning (Elleret al ., 1994). Subsequent studies revealed that agents thatdamaged DNA exclusively, such as DNA restriction enzymesor DNA-damaging chemicals, also induced tanning incultured pigment cells (Eller et al ., 1996). Consistent withextensive data implicating telomere disruption and the
consequent exposure of the TTAGGG sequence as thepostulated control mechanism of UV-induced tanning,oligonucleotides with greater telomere homology showhigher molar efficacy for increasing melanin content in bothcultured pigment cells (Figure 2) and human skin explants(Eller et al., 2008a). Moreover, experimental disruption of thetelomere loop by transfection with TRF2DNincreases themelanin content of cultured human melanocytes (Figure 3).Tanning because of either UV irradiation or T-oligo treatmentis mediated at least in large part by the p53 protein, in thatdominant-negative p53 blocks increased melanogenesisbecause of either UV irradiation or pTT treatment (Khlgatianet al., 2002); and moreover, in p53 knockout mice, increased
melanogenesis after UV irradiation is markedly decreasedand absent altogether after pTT treatment (Gilchrest, 2004).The greatly reduced or absent tanning response in p53knockout mice has recently been confirmed by others (Cuiet al., 2007). pTT treatment of human skin explants similarlyincreases melanogenesis, accompanied by the activation ofp53 and tyrosinase upregulation, leading to increasedepidermal melanin content with supranuclear melanin capsand enhanced melanocyte dendricity, fully reproducing thehistological picture of the UV-induced tanning response(Arad et al ., 2006, 2007). The functional aspect of UV-induced tanning—photoprotection—is also reproduced bypTT treatment, with pTT-treated guinea pig skin fully resistantto damage induced by a 6 minimal erythema-dose (MED)exposure, at least by histological criteria (Gilchrest and Eller,1999).A SECOND PROTECTIVE RESPONSE: ENHANCED DNA
1999).A SECOND PROTECTIVE RESPONSE: ENHANCED DNAREPAIRProtective responses after DNA damage are reminiscent ofthe bacterial SOS response, a term first coined in the 1970s(Radman, 1975) for a process now well understood at themolecular level (Gilchrest and Eller, 2001). In bacteria, afteracute DNA damage, single-stranded DNA generated atstalled replication forks combines with the RecA protein,and the DNA-protein complex then cleaves the Lex A
and the DNA-protein complex then cleaves the Lex Arepressor protein, leading to de-repression of approximately20 genes, all of which encode DNA repair enzymes (Walker,1984). As a consequence, within hours of the initial DNAdamage, the increased abundance of repair proteins allowsfor a more rapid repair of subsequently incurred DNAdamage, enhancing bacterial survival in the face of ongoingenvironmental insults. Indeed, pTT treatment of culturedhuman skin-derived cells, human skin explants, and intactmouse skin reveals a generally two- to threefold increase inthe level of multiple DNA repair enzymes and cell cycleS91 melanin content (pg per cell)S91 melanin content (pg per cell)DilDil pTT100 u MpTT100 u MpGTTA…pGTTA… pCTAA…pCTAA… pGATC…pGATC…40 u M40 u M140120100806040200Figure 2 .T-oligo-induced melanogenesis is influenced by the degree oftelomere homology. S91 murine melanoma cells known to respond to UV

Triplicate dishes of each condition were harvested after4 days and melanin content was determined spectrophotometrically(absorption at 475 nm; A475) and converted to pg per cell using a standardcurve. Compared with diluent alone, 100 mMpTT increased melanin contentapproximately four-fold. However, the 11 base 100% telomere homolog atonly 40 mMincreased the melanin content more than 12-fold ( Po0.05 vsdiluent).

regulatory proteins, prominently including p53, as well asaccelerated removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and(6–4) photoproducts after UV irradiation (Eller et al ., 1997;Goukassian et al ., 1999). The response is qualitatively andquantitatively comparable with that induced by a moderatelydamaging UV irradiation dose, aside from the fact that pTTtreatment does not initially introduce DNA damage, asjudged by the absence of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers(Arad et al., 2007) and by the low level of mutation in pTT-treated cells (Khlgatian et al., 1999; Goukassian et al., 2004).Thus, both pTT treatment and UV irradiation of human skininduce a response that is at least functionally analogous to thebacterial SOS response. In human skin, however, it is a dualresponse: within 48–72 hours of pTT or UV treatment, the skincontains increased melanin that absorbs damaging UVradiation from a second exposure, reducing the amount ofphotoproducts introduced into the epidermis (Arad et al .,
2007). Moreover, the rate of removal of this damage isgreatly accelerated in skin that has been pTT-treated orUV-irradiated earlier (Arad et al., 2007). This phenomenon,noted by others studying the effect of repeated UV exposureson human skin, has also been termed the photoadaptiveresponse (Agar and Young, 2005).The bacterial SOS response protects the genome andincreases the probability of bacterial survival by enhancingthe rate of repair after an initial episode of DNA damage. Ithas been well documented, however, that the induced repaircapacity is more error prone than the constitutive repairsystem (Radman, 1975; Foster, 2007). The resulting increasein mutation rate, attributable specifically to the UmuC andUmuD gene products (Rajagopalan et al., 1992; Tang et al.,1999; Maor-Shoshani et al., 2000), is interpreted as helpful tobacterial adaptation and survival in a DNA-damagingenvironment. However, an enhanced DNA repair capacity
that is error prone would likely be much less advantageousfor multicellular organisms in which cumulative mutationsmight be expected to result in cancer and death of theorganism. We were therefore intrigued to observe that theinducible component of DNA repair in mammalian cells isnot error prone. Moreover, in the face of repeated mutagenicexposures to UV irradiation, cells in pTT-treated skin incurredfewer mutations than those in control skin, as determined bythe quantification of either mutations in a LacZ reportertransgene (Goukassian et al ., 2004) or p53-mutated kerati-nocyte clones in chronically irradiated skin (Arad et al .,2008). The mammalian SOS-like response in human skin thusincludes at least two distinct components: enhanced mela-nogenesis (so-called tanning) and enhanced high-fidelityDNA repair capacity.A THIRD PROTECTIVE RESPONSE: CELL SENESCENCE
A THIRD PROTECTIVE RESPONSE: CELL SENESCENCEA third genome protective mechanism is replicative senes-cence (Campisi, 2005). It has long been recognized thatnormal somatic cells can undergo only a finite number ofpostnatal cell divisions, after which they can no longerdivide, regardless of mitogenic stimuli (Hayflick and Moor-head, 1961; Hayflick, 1965). More recently, it has beenshown that exposure to oxidative stress (Toussaint et al .,2000) or forced overexpression of an oncogene (Zhu et al.,
1998; Guney and Sedivy, 2006) similarly pushes the cell intoa senescent permanently non-dividing state. Although orga-nismal aging is not identical to cell senescence, it is widelyacknowledged that old tissues contain senescent cells andthat senescent cells have characteristics in addition toproliferative failure that are also found in old tissues (Krtolicaand Campisi, 2002). Furthermore, it has been suggested thataging, specifically cell senescence, is an anticancer defensemechanism, the price paid for protecting organisms fromsuccumbing to malignancy during the reproductive phase oflife (Campisi, 2005).PHOTOAGING
succumbing to malignancy during the reproductive phase oflife (Campisi, 2005).PHOTOAGINGIn skin, perceived aging is largely photoaging, the processoverwhelmingly responsible for unwanted age-associatedchanges in skin appearance and the context in which skincancer develops (Yaar and Gilchrest, 1998). Protectivetelomere-based mechanisms seem to play a large role.Chronological or intrinsic aging is understood to be theconsequence of repeated cell divisions over many years,AdTRF2DNDiluentAdTRF2DNAdTRF2DNTyrosinasep53ActinAdGFPDiluent AdGFP20015010050Melanin(pg per cell)0Diluent AdGFPFigure 3 .Telomere loop disruption by TRF2DNin human melanocytesincreases melanin content and upregulates p53 and tyrosinase protein levels.Paired dishes of melanocytes derived from newborn foreskin were infectedwith an adenovirus vector encoding TRF2DN, known to disrupt the telomereloop (van Steensel et al., 1998), or with green fluorescent protein as an

leading to critical telomere shortening and cell senescencefor at least many cells in the tissue, reducing proliferativecapacity and homeostatic reserve (Yaar and Gilchrest, 1998).The process of cell senescence is understood to beaccelerated by an oxidative cellular metabolism that pro-duces DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species (Toussaintet al., 2000; Bertram and Hass, 2008). In sun-exposed skin,chronic photodamage is superimposed on these processes.UVB, and to a lesser extent UVA, produces thymine dimersand other DNA photoproducts (Beukers et al., 2008), whichmay ultimately lead to mutations in coding or regulatorysequences and, cumulatively, to skin cancer (Nishigori,2006). UV, particularly UVA, also introduces oxidativedamage to DNA (Nishigori, 2006; Moriwaki and Takahashi,2008), largely in the form of 8-oxo-guanine (8-oxo-G).WHY DEPEND ON TELOMERES FOR DNA DAMAGE
WHY DEPEND ON TELOMERES FOR DNA DAMAGESIGNALING?It has been observed that DNA-damaging agents, including,but not restricted to, UV irradiation, introduce damagethroughout the genome, but introduce proportionately moredamage into telomeres (Oikawa and Kawanishi, 1999). Thisis the logical consequence of the telomere sequence,TTAGGG: dithymidines (one-third of the repeat sequence)are the preferred substrate for UV-induced damage (Setlowand Carrier, 1966; Bertram and Hass, 2008; Beukers et al .,2008) and guanine (one-half of the repeat sequence) is thepreferred substrate for oxidative damage, whereas damagebecause of chemical carcinogens targets either guanine oradjacent adenine–guanine bases (Kvam and Tyrrell, 1997;Ishibashi and Lippard, 1998; Redon et al ., 2003; Rao and
Bierbach, 2007). We thus suggest that chronic exposure tosunlight or other DNA-damaging agents would logicallyresult in DNA damage signaling through the telomere-basedpathway, leading either to proliferative senescence or to SOS-like responses, both of which reduce the risk of skin cancerdevelopment (Figure 4). We further speculate that theproficiency of the SOS-like response determines both thecharacter of photoaging (atrophy versus hypertrophy, focaldepigmentation versus hyperpigmentation, etc.) and skincancer risk. Specifically, we suggest that individuals currentlyclassified as having Fitzpatrick skin phototype I/II have poorSOS-like responses, whereas those with Fitzpatrick skinphototype IV–VI have good SOS responses (Kosmadaki andGilchrest, 2004). In this context, it is interesting to note thatpermanent darkening of the skin, a non-fading tan alsotermed ‘‘bronzing,’’ is a well-recognized aspect of photoa-ging (Bolognia, 1995; Halachmi et al ., 2005), especially in
individuals who tan proficiently and have a relatively lowskin cancer risk. As T-oligos can initiate telomere-basedsignaling in the absence of DNA damage (Eller et al., 2006b),and because T-oligos seem to preferentially induceSOS-like responses rather than cell senescence or apoptosisin normal cells (Puri et al ., 2004; Yaar et al ., 2007), itseems to be at least theoretically possible to manipulate theintrinsic signaling mechanism to favor protective SOS-likeresponses over replicative senescence as a means of canceravoidance.CONCLUSION
We suggest that telomere-based SOS-like responses, normallyinduced by DNA damage, have evolved, perhaps from theoriginal bacterial response, to protect human genomeintegrity. Components of the mammalian SOS responseinclude increased melanogenesis and enhanced DNA repaircapacity. T-oligos, which act at telomeres in the absence ofDNA damage to exaggerate these responses, may reducecellular reliance on senescence (aging), a third telomere-based genome-protective mechanism.CONFLICT OF INTEREST/DISCLOSUREThe authors are inventors of patents that protect the use of T-oligos to enhancemelanogenesis and reduce skin aging; and are equity holders in SemaCo, acompany formed to commercialize this intellectual property.8-oxo-G8-oxo-GOxidativecellularmetabolismOxidativecellularmetabolismRepeatedcell divisions Repeated

Chronological or intrinsic aging consists at least in part of cellsenescence, the result of progressive telomere shortening that causes cells toenter a permanently non-dividing state (senescence) that we postulate toresult from exposure of the TTAGGG telomere sequence (see Figure 1). Cellaging is also understood to result in part from chronic low-grade oxidativedamage, for example, because of aerobic metabolism, expected to produce8-oxo-guanine, which we postulate would enhance signaling through the
telomere pathway. Extrinsic aging in skin is largely the consequence of UVirradiation. Both UVB and UVA cause DNA damage, UVB primarily throughproduction of photoproducts such as thymine dimers, and UVA in large partthrough indirect oxidative damage of guanine bases. Such damage can lead tomutation of key regulatory genes and cumulatively to skin cancer. Lesionsproduced in telomeric DNA, however, are postulated to induce signaling asdescribed in Figure 1. Such signaling can lead to cell senescence. However, avariety of adaptive or SOS-like responses also occur, as described in the text,creating a balance that varies strikingly among individuals of differentphototype. T-oligos activate the same signaling pathway, but unlikeUV irradiation, without initial DNA damage. Moreover, in normal cells,T-oligos seem to favor adaptive responses over senescence (or apoptosis),whereas in dysregulated cells, the reverse is observed. Adapted fromHalachmi et al. (2005).
