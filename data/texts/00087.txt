Matrix-Degrading Metalloproteinases in PhotoagingTaihao Quan1, Zhaoping Qin1,2, Wei Xia1,2, Yuan Shao1, John J. Voorhees1and Gary J. Fisher1UV radiation from the sun impacts skin healthadversely through complex, multiple molecular path-ways. Premature skin aging (photoaging) is among themost widely appreciated harmful effects of chronicexposure to solar UV radiation. Extensive damage tothe dermal connective tissue is a hallmark of photo-aged skin. Disruption of the normal architecture ofskin connective tissue impairs skin function andcauses it to look aged. UV irradiation inducesexpression of certain members of the matrix metallo-proteinase (MMP) family, which degrade collagen andother extracellular matrix proteins that comprise thedermal connective tissue. Although the critical role of
MMPs in photoaging is undeniable, important ques-tions remain. This article summarizes our currentunderstanding of the role of MMPs in the photoagingprocess and presents new data that (1) describe theexpression and regulation by UV irradiation of allmembers of the MMP family in human skinin vivoand (2) quantify the relative contributions of epider-mis and dermis to the expression of UV irradiation-induced MMPs in human skin in vivo .Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings (2009) 14,20–24; doi:10.1038/jidsymp.2009.8INTRODUCTIONHuman skin is the only organ directly exposed to UVradiation from the sun. Solar UV radiation is a well-recognized environmental hazard. Acute exposure of humanskin to UV radiation causes sunburn, altered pigmentation,inflammation, immune suppression, and dermal connectivetissue damage (Kripke, 1984; Gilchrest and Yaar, 1992;Kaminer, 1995; Fisher et al., 1996, 1997, 2002). Chronic UV
irradiation over many years disrupts normal architecture ofthe skin and ultimately causes premature skin aging (photo-aging) and skin cancer.Clinically, photoaging is recognizable by fine and coarsewrinkles, blotchy dyspigmentation, increased fragility, andrough skin texture (Kligman and Kligman, 1986; Berneberget al., 2000; Scharffetter-Kochanek et al., 2000). Histologicaland ultrastructural studies have revealed minimal epidermalchanges. In contrast, major alterations are seen in dermalconnective tissue, characterized by damaged and disorganizedcollagen fibrils, which constitute the bulk (90% dry weight) ofskin connective tissue, and massive accumulation of aberrantelastic material, referred to as ‘‘solar elastosis.’’ These observa-tions indicate that UV radiation causes qualitative alterations inextracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and suggest that matrix-degrading proteases participate in this process.Type I collagen is the major structural protein in the dermal
ECM (Nimni, 1983; Uitto and Bernstein, 1998). Collagenprecursor molecules (procollagen) are synthesized by dermalfibroblasts. Procollagen is secreted into extracellular spaces,where it is enzymatically processed to mature collagen. Maturecollagen spontaneously forms fibrils, which are stabilized bycross-links. Collagen fibrils are largely responsible for thestrength and resilience of skin. Collagen fibrils have anestimated half-life of 17 years. Therefore, fragmented collagenfibrils accumulate with the passage of time and have long-lasting consequences on skin structure and function.UV irradiation causes alternations in dermal collagenthrough two primary pathways: (1) stimulation of collagenbreakdown, resulting in fragmented, disorganized collagenand (2) inhibition of procollagen biosynthesis, resulting in aloss of collagen content. A single exposure to UV radiation(2MED) causes near-complete loss of procollagen synthesis,
which persists for 24 hours, followed by recovery 48–72 hourslater (Fisher et al ., 2000). This reduction in procollagensynthesis is most likely mediated by impairment of transform-ing growth factor- bpathways, which control procollagenexpression (Quan et al ., 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005). Matrix-
synthesis is most likely mediated by impairment of transform-ing growth factor- bpathways, which control procollagenexpression (Quan et al ., 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005). Matrix-degrading metalloproteinases (MMPs) are key mediatorsof collagen degradation that is observed in photoaged skin(Fisher et al., 1996, 1997, 1998, 2002; Fisher and Voorhees,1998). This review article summarizes matrix MMP expres-sion and regulation by UV irradiation in human skin in vivo .MMP GENE EXPRESSION IN NON-IRRADIATED ANDUV-IRRADIATED HUMAN SKIN IN VIVOMMPs comprise a family of zinc-containing proteinases thatare responsible for degrading ECM proteins, which form skindermal connective tissue (Nelson et al., 2000; Sternlicht andWerb, 2001). To date, the MMP gene family consists of 25REVIEW

members, 24 of which are expressed in mammals (Sternlichtand Werb, 2001; Egeblad and Werb, 2002; Fu et al., 2008).MMPs are classified as collagenases, gelatinases, stromely-sins, and membrane-type MMPs according to their substratespecificities and depending on whether they are secreted assoluble proteins or bound to cell surface membranes (Fuet al ., 2008). MMPs are involved in a wide range ofproteolytic events in physiological and pathological circum-stances, including embryogenesis, wound healing, inflam-mation, angiogenesis, and cancer (Birkedal-Hansen et al .,1993; Sternlicht and Werb, 2001; Egeblad and Werb, 2002;Kerkela and Saarialho-Kere, 2003).Studies conducted by us and by others over the pastseveral years have revealed that UV radiation elevates at leastthree different MMPs in human skin in vivo , that is interstitialcollagenase (MMP-1), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), and 92-kDagelatinase (MMP-9) (Fisher et al., 1996, 1997, 2002; Fisher
and Voorhees, 1998; Brenneisen et al., 2002; Wang et al.,2008). These three MMPs are strongly regulated by transcrip-tion factor activator protein-1, which is rapidly induced andactivated by UV radiation in human skin in vivo (Gutman andWasylyk, 1990; Birkedal-Hansen et al., 1993; Mauviel, 1993;Fisher and Voorhees, 1998). The combined actions of MMP-1, -3, and -9 have the capacity to degrade most of the proteinsthat comprise the dermal ECM. However, whether UVirradiation induces expression of other members of theMMP family in human skin has not been fully determined.To address this question, we investigated basal and UVradiation-induced gene expression of each mammalian MMPin human skin in vivo .With the exception of MMP-14, basal mRNA expression
levels of the MMP family members were extremely low innormal healthy, sun-protected, adult human skin (Figure 1).Transcripts for MMP-8, -10, -12, -20, and -26 were notdetected. Transcripts for remaining MMPs were near the levelof detection, approximately 1,000-fold lower than theinternal control, housekeeping gene 36B4. Basal expressionof MMP-14 mRNA was approximately 35-fold higher thanthat of other detectable MMPs.Interestingly, among the 19 MMPs expressed in normalhuman skin, only three were significantly induced inresponse to UV irradiation: MMP-1 (collagenase), MMP-3(stromelysin-1), and MMP-9 (92-kDa gelatinase) (Figure 2).MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA levels were induced several1,000-fold at 24 hours post-UV irradiation, whereas MMP-9was induced modestly (sixfold). MMP-1 initiates cleavage offibrillar collagen, typically type I and III in skin, at a single sitewithin its central triple helix. Once cleaved by MMP-1,
collagen can be further degraded by elevated levels of MMP-3 and MMP-9. These data confirm and extend our earlierfindings (Fisher et al ., 1996, 1997, 2002; Fisher andVoorhees, 1998; Wang et al., 2008). Interestingly, in contrastto UV-inducible MMPs, MMP-14 was reduced nearly 80% at8 hours post-UV irradiation, and remained decreased for atleast 24 hours (data not shown). The physiological function ofMMP-14 in human skin remains to be determined.We have earlier reported that MMP-8 (neutrophil colla-genase) (Fisher et al ., 2001) and MMP-12 (macrophageelastase) (Chung et al., 2002) proteins are present in humanskin 24 hours after UV irradiation, as a result of an influx ofneutrophils and macrophages from the circulation. Skinneutrophils and macrophages are terminally differentiatedcells that no longer transcribe new mRNA. Residual MMP-8
and MMP-12 mRNA was below the limit of detection. Wehave earlier reported that the majority of MMP-8 proteinremained in the inactive precursor form (Fisher et al., 2001)and accounted for little, if any, collagenolytic activity in skinfollowing UV irradiation (Brennan et al., 2003). Furthermore,
and accounted for little, if any, collagenolytic activity in skinfollowing UV irradiation (Brennan et al., 2003). Furthermore,the exposure of sun-protected human skin to purified humanMMP-1 in organ culture causes collagen fragmentation andalterations in the structure and organization of collagen fibrilsin the dermis that resemble those observed in photoagedskin (Varani et al., 2001, 2008; Fligiel et al., 2003). Takentogether, these studies suggest that MMP-1, MMP-3, andMMP-9 are primary UV-inducible collagenolytic enzymes,and MMP-1 is the major protease capable of initiating thedegradation of native fibrillar collagens in human skinin vivo .E P I D E R M I SI ST H EM A J O RS O U R C EO FU VIRRADIATION-INDUCED MMPs IN HUMAN SKININ VIVOOn the basis of in situ hybridization and immunohistology,we have earlier reported that keratinocytes are the majorcellular source of MMPs in UV-irradiated human skin in vivo(Fisher et al., 1997; Fisher and Voorhees, 1998).

irradiation-induced MMP expression, epidermis and dermiswere analyzed separately by laser capture microdissection,coupled with real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. Figure 3shows human skin sections before and after laser capturemicrodissection of epidermis and dermis. Total RNA wasextracted from microdissected epidermis and dermis and UVirradiation-induced MMP mRNA levels were determined byreal-time reverse transcriptase PCR. In agreement with ourearlier data, all three UV irradiation-inducible MMPs wereproduced primarily in the epidermis, rather than in the dermis(Figure 4). It should be noted that dermal samples containedsome epidermal contamination (approximately 10%), basedon measurement of keratin 14 mRNA, which is expressedexclusively by keratinocytes. Therefore, dermal contributionsto UV irradiation-induced MMP expression cannot be greaterthan those shown in Figure 4.In contrast to the results presented above, cell culture and
skin equivalent model studies have concluded that dermalfibroblasts are the major source of MMPs that are expressedin response to UV irradiation (Fagot et al., 2002, 2004).

skin cells in vivo and responses of cultured skin cells in vitroare not known. However, there are many other examples ofcultured skin cells failing to mimic the behavior of cellsin vivo . Obviously, it is important to compare, wheneverpossible, results obtained from simple model systems withthose obtained from direct in vivo observations.Although collagen-degrading MMP-1, -3, and -9 areprimarily induced in the epidermis, the secreted enzymesdiffuse into the dermis and degrade collagen, as shown by insituzymography (Figure 5). This diffusion may be aided bydirect binding of MMPs to the collagenous ECM (Windsoret al., 1991; Knauper et al., 1997; Overall, 2001).Taken together with earlier findings, the data presentedabove indicate that epidermal keratinocytes are the majorcellular source of MMPs that are produced in response toexposure of human skin to solar UV radiation. However, it ispossible that dermal cells may also play a role in epidermal
production of MMPs, through indirect paracrine mechanisms,by release of growth factors or cytokines, which in turnmodulate MMP production by epidermal keratinocytes.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors state no conflict of interest.REFERENCESBerneberg M, Plettenberg H, Krutmann J (2000) Photoaging of human skin.Photodermatol Photoimmunol Photomed 16:239–44Birkedal-Hansen H, Moore W, Bodden M, Windsor L, Birkedal-Hansen B,DeCarlo A et al.
