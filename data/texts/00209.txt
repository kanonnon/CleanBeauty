REVIEWCarotenoids and Flavonoids Contribute to Nutritional Protectionagainst Skin Damage from SunlightWilhelm Stahl ÆHelmut SiesPublished online: 9 August 2007/C211Humana Press Inc. 2007Abstract The concept of photoprotection by dietarymeans is gaining momentum. Plant constituents such ascarotenoids and ﬂavonoids are involved in protectionagainst excess light in plants and contribute to the pre-vention of UV damage in humans. As micronutrients, theyare ingested with the diet and are distributed into light-exposed tissues, such as skin or the eye where they providesystemic photoprotection. b-Carotene and lycopene pre-vent UV-induced erythema formation. Likewise, dietaryﬂavanols exhibit photoprotection. After about 10–12 weeksof dietary intervention, a decrease in the sensitivity towardUV-induced erythema was observed in volunteers. Dietarymicronutrients may contribute to life-long protectionagainst harmful UV radiation.Keywords Photoprotection /C1Micronutrients /C1

UV exposureof the skin leads to chemical and biological reactions denotedas photooxidative stress [ 2]. Primarily, light of an appro-priate wavelength interacts with a suitable chromophore,which may be directly damaged or act as a photosensitizer.Short-lived electronically excited species initiate subsequentreactions. In the presence of oxygen, secondary reactiveoxygen species are generated extending the range of photo-damage. Photooxidative damage affects cellular lipids,proteins, and DNA and is involved in the pathobiochemistryof erythema formation, premature aging of the skin, devel-opment of photodermatoses, and skin cancer.Sunburn is a visible dermal reaction following excessiveexposure to sunlight, called UV-induced or solar erythema,
and is characterized by tenderness, sometimes painfulblistering, and second-degree burns [ 3]. Direct and indirectdamage resulting from photochemical reactions leads tovasodilation of dermal vessels and edema and causesincreased blood ﬂow in the affected area. Damage to pro-teins and DNA accumulates within skin cells, andmorphological changes occur in keratinocytes and otherskin cells. When a cell becomes irreversibly damaged byUV exposure, cell death follows viaapoptotic mechanisms,leading to the appearance of so-called sunburn cells in theepidermis [ 4,5].The UV-B part of solar radiation is highly erythemato-genic and is considered as major cause of typical sunburn,which starts to develop a few hours after irradiation, cul-minating about 18–24 h post-irradiation.The sensitivity of an individual toward erythematogenicUV exposure is determined by the minimal erythemal dose(MED), deﬁned as the threshold dose required to cause a
perceptible reddening of the skin 24 h after exposure [ 6].MED values differ between individuals and depend on theendogenous protection by melanin and on skin type. Mel-anin levels determine the skin color and are related to someextent to the skin type, which is often categorized fol-lowing the Fitzpatrick scale ranging from type I to VI. Skintype I is assigned to people with white or freckled skin,green or light-blue eyes, red hair and high sensitivity to sunlight; skin type VI shows black skin, dark brown eyes, andblack hair, almost never experiencing sunburn [ 7].W.

PhotoprotectionSeveral strategies are applicable for protection againsthazardous light exposure and subsequent impairment ofmolecular and cellular functions [ 8]. Avoidance of sunexposure, and protective covering and topical applicationof sunscreens with a high sun protection factor are rec-ommended during times of intense exposure. A majorcontribution to endogenous protection of the human skin isprovided by melanins, endogenous pigments that scatterand absorb UV light [ 9]. In epidermal melanocytes, theproduction of melanin is increased by exposure to sunlight(tanning).Endogenous or systemic photoprotection may beenhanced by supplying dietary or non-dietary compoundswith photoprotective properties. The concept of additionalendogenous protection was proposed about 30 years ago[10] and, as mentioned above, has been reviewed recently[1,11]. In order to increase the barrier for UV light, thecompound should absorb UV light over a broad range of
wavelengths with high efﬁcacy. Antioxidants protectmolecular targets by scavenging reactive oxygen species,including excited singlet oxygen and triplet state mole-cules. Compounds that modulate stress-dependentsignaling and/or suppress cellular and tissue responses likeinﬂammation are suitable for this purpose.A number of efﬁcient micronutrients are capable ofdirectly scavenging lipophilic and hydrophilic prooxidantsor serving as constituents of antioxidant enzymes. Carot-enoids, tocopherols, ﬂavanols, and other polyphenols aswell as vitamin C contribute to antioxidant defense andthus contribute to endogenous photoprotection.Carotenoids in PhotoprotectionCarotenoids as accessory light-harvesting pigments playan essential role in the protection of plants againstexcess light and photooxidative stress [ 12,13]. Carote-noids exhibit a long central chain of conjugated doublebonds carrying acyclic or cyclic substituents. Xantho-
phylls, also called oxocarotenoids, contain functionaloxygen groups [ 14]. The extended system of conjugateddouble bonds is crucial for the antioxidant properties ofcarotenoids [ 15–17]. Carotenoids are among the mostefﬁcient natural scavengers of singlet molecular oxygen[16,18]. It has been suggested that UVA-dependent skinaging is mainly associated with singlet oxygen formationand that the effects of b-carotene on signaling are atleast in part related to singlet oxygen-quenching prop-erties [ 19]. At low oxygen tension, carotenoids alsoscavenge peroxyl radicals [ 20], inhibiting the process oflipid peroxidation.The most abundant carotenoids in the human organism areb-carotene, a-carotene, and lycopene, as well as the xan-thophylls lutein, zeaxanthin, a- andb-cryptoxanthin [ 21,22].Carotenoid levels in human skin are in the range of 0.2–0.6 nmol/g wet tissue [ 23]; however, there are signiﬁcantdifferences regarding the level of single carotenoids and
distribution of carotenoids within different skin areas [ 24].b-Carotene supplements are applied as oral sun protec-tants. Data from human studies on the photoprotectiveeffects of orally applied b-carotene are contradictory. Insome of the studies, moderate photoprotection was deter-mined, while no effects were found in others (see [ 1]). Ithas been noted that the efﬁcacy of b-carotene in systemicphotoprotection is dependent on the duration of treatmentbefore light exposure and on the dose. In studies in whichprotection was observed, treatment with carotenoids wasfor at least 10 weeks, and the dose was higher than 20 mgof carotenoids per day [ 10,25–27]. In studies reporting noprotective effects, carotenoids were applied for only 3–8 weeks [ 28,29]. Based on these ﬁndings, it has beenconcluded that the application of moderate doses of b-carotene alone is not sufﬁcient to obtain sustained photo-protection [ 29].The use of high doses of b-carotene in supplements for
photoprotection has been discussed controversially, as a
carotene alone is not sufﬁcient to obtain sustained photo-protection [ 29].The use of high doses of b-carotene in supplements forphotoprotection has been discussed controversially, as aresult of safety concerns [ 30]. In two intervention trialswith individuals at a high risk for lung cancer, a highercumulative index for lung cancer was observed in thegroups that received b-carotene [ 31–33]. Therefore, othercarotenoids or dietary sources providing considerableamounts of other carotenoids may be suitable for endoge-nous photoprotection. Supplementation with a daily dose of24 mg of carotenoid mix comprising the three main dietarycarotenoids, b-carotene, lutein, and lycopene (8 mg each/d)provides protection against UV-induced erythema; theeffect was comparable to that of b-carotene alone appliedat 24 mg/d [ 34].LycopeneMore than 80% of lycopene consumed in the United Statesis derived from tomato products, although apricots, papaya,
pink grapefruit, guava, and watermelon also contribute todietary intake. Lycopene content of tomatoes can varysigniﬁcantly, depending on type of tomato and ripening. Inthe reddest strains of tomatoes, lycopene levels are close to50 mg per kg compared with only 5 mg per kg in theyellow strains. In most cases, bioavailability of lycopenefrom dietary sources is increased by thermal processingand by co-ingestion of dietary lipids [ 35,36]. Processing offood helps to release lycopene from the food matrix, thusimproving accessibility of the lipophilic compound for theMol Biotechnol (2007) 37:26–30 27
formation of lipid micelles together with dietary lipids andbile acids. Cooking and food processing enhance the bio-availability of carotenoids; e.g., lycopene uptake is higherafter ingestion of processed tomatoes (tomato paste) ascompared to fresh tomatoes [ 37].Many of the reported health beneﬁts of lycopene areattributed to its ability to protect cells against oxidativedamage. Although there has been less research focused onlycopene compared to other carotenoids, in vitro studies showthat lycopene is a very efﬁcient quencher of singlet oxygenand a potent scavenger of oxygen radicals [ 18,38,39].In the following paragraphs, we describe a series ofstudies performed in our laboratory investigating thephotoprotective effects in human intervention trials.Study DesignData from human intervention studies have been published,and methodological details have been described [ 40,41].
Volunteers who participated in the studies were of skintype II, which was evaluated based on the coloration ofskin, hair and eyes and the history of sensitivity to sunexposure [ 42]. Further criteria for inclusion were healthycondition, body mass index (BMI) of 18–25 kg/m2,n opregnancy or lactation, no supplementation with vitamins,and no medication during the study.Erythema Prevention and Measurement of Skin ColorPrior to the start of the study, the minimal erythemal dose(MED) was determined for each subject. At the time pointsof blood sampling, dorsal skin was irradiated with UV light(1.25–fold the MED) to induce erythema; for irradiation ablue-light solar simulator (Ho ¨nle, Munich, Germany) wasapplied. The test for photoprotection is based on the rec-ommendations of the COLIPA work group ‘‘Sun-Protection-Measurement’’ [ 43]. At each time point, skincolor was evaluated before and 24 h after irradiation. Skincolor was determined by chromametry (Chromameter Mi-
nolta CR 200, Ahrensburg, Germany) using the three-dimensional color system ( L,a,b-values). L-values are aparameter for lightness of skin and b-values (blue/yellowaxis) are indicative for pigmentation. a-Values (red/green-axis) are a measure for skin reddening. D-a values werecalculated subtracting the a-value measured before irradi-ation from the a-value determined after irradiation. Theyare directly related to UV-induced erythema formation andwere used to quantify skin responses to UV irradiation.Upon successful intervention, D-a values at the end of thestudy should be lower than at the beginning. The a-valuesdiffer between individuals due to skin sensitivity and basalskin color. For better comparison, the D-a values at thebeginning of the study were set at 100% and the otherscalculated as the percentage of basal numbers.Photoprotective Effects Following the Consumptionof Lycopene-Rich ProductsThe difference between chromametry a-values after and
before irradiation ( Da-value) were taken as a measure forUV-response of the skin, namely erythema formation.Decreasing D-avalues in comparison to week 0 (set to100%) reﬂect a protection against UV-induced erythema.Following the ingestion of tomato paste, a decrease in theDa-values from week 0 to week 4 and week 10 wasdetermined. The difference was most pronounced andstatistically signiﬁcant on week 10. In comparison tobaseline, the D-avalue was lowered by about 40% [ 40].Treatment with synthetic lycopene for a period of12 week led to a decrease in the Da-value after 12 week.However, the difference was statistically not signiﬁcant.Four different sources were used to supply lycopene tovolunteers and investigate UV-protective effects over aperiod of 10–12 week [see 11]. The daily dose of lycopenewas comparable between groups, ranging from 8.2 to16 mg/d. In one of the groups (lycopene synthetic), onlylycopene and no other carotenoid was present [ 44]. The
supplements derived from tomato-based products contain anumber of other constituents including further carotenoids
lycopene and no other carotenoid was present [ 44]. Thesupplements derived from tomato-based products contain anumber of other constituents including further carotenoidssuch as phytoﬂuene and phytoene, which are precursors oflycopene in the biosynthetic pathway. These compoundsmay well contribute to the photoprotective effects, sincethey absorb in the UV-range.Photoprotection by High-Flavanol CocoaFollowing the studies with carotenoids, we examined thequestion whether high-ﬂavanol cocoa provides photopro-tection against UV-induced erythema [ 45]. In that study,two groups of volunteers consumed either a high ﬂavanol(326 mg/d) or low ﬂavanol (27 mg/d) cocoa powder dis-solved in 100 ml water over a period of 12 weeks.Photoprotective effects and parameters of skin conditionwere measured before and during the intervention. Fol-lowing exposure of selected skin areas toward 1.25minimal erythemal dose (MED), UV-induced erythema
minimal erythemal dose (MED), UV-induced erythemawas signiﬁcantly decreased in the high-ﬂavanol group, by50% and 70%, after 6 and 12 week of treatment, respec-tively, whereas no change was found in the low-ﬂavanolgroup. Ingestion of high ﬂavanol cocoa led to an increasein blood ﬂow of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues, and toa signiﬁcant increase in skin density, thickness, and skin28 Mol Biotechnol (2007) 37:26–30
hydration. These parameters were not affected in the lowﬂavanol group. Evaluation of the skin surface showed asigniﬁcant decrease of skin roughness and scaling in thehigh ﬂavanol cocoa group, whereas again no change wasfound in the low ﬂavanol cocoa group, comparing thestarting values with week 6 and 12. The presented data [ 45]show that ingestion of dietary ﬂavanols from cocoa con-tributes to endogenous photoprotection and improvesdermal blood circulation. Cocoa ﬂavanols further affectcosmetically relevant parameters of skin surface andhydration. Recently, a short-term study was completed,showing that dermal blood ﬂow was increased 1.7-fold at2 h and oxygen saturation of dermal hemoglobin was ele-vated 1.8-fold upon intake of high ﬂavanol cocoa [ 46].ConclusionCarotenoids are suitable compounds for photoprotection inthe human. In addition to b-carotene, other carotenoids like
lycopene or lutein can be used as photoprotectants.Photoprotective effects can be achieved with a diet rich incarotenoids. However, it should be noted that other com-ponents of the diet such as further carotenoids (phytoene,phytoﬂuene) or non-carotenoid constituents contribute tophotoprotection. Notably, this applies to ﬂavanols as evi-denced by protective effects observed with cocoa rich inﬂavanols.Endogenous protection associated with dietary means isto be considered complementary to the topical use of asunscreen with a high-sun protection factor. Increasing thebasal protection systemically contributes to life-longdefense against UV-dependent skin damage.Acknowledgment The lycopene project was supported in part bythe Bundesministerium fu ¨r Bildung und Forschung, Bonn (Project:0312248C).
