Involvement of a Forkhead Transcription Factor,FOXO1a, in UV-Induced Changes of CollagenMetabolismHiroshi Tanaka1, Yuhko Murakami1, Izumi Ishii1and Satoru Nakata1Transcription factors belonging to the forkhead box gene, group O (FOXOs) family have been found to becrucial in downstream suppression of life-shortening effects of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)signaling pathway, which accelerates aging by suppressing FOXOs. Thus, FOXOs could hold the key forcounteracting aging. Although FOXOs may play a critical role in aging, the effects of FOXOs on UV-inducedchanges of collagen metabolism by dermal fibroblasts are unknown. In this study, UV-induced changes inFOXO1a expression and the roles of FOXO1a in the regulation of collagen synthesis and matrixmetalloproteinase (MMPs) expression in human dermal fibroblasts were investigated. In UVA- or UVB-irradiated fibroblasts, the expression ofFOXO1A mRNA decreased significantly. The expression of type I
collagen ( COLIAI ) also decreased. On the other hand, MMP-1 and MMP-2 mRNA levels increased. FOXO1A-small interfering RNA transfection induced the downregulation of FOXO1A expression, it also induced adecrease in COLIAI expression, and it increased MMP-1 and MMP-2 expression. These changes are similar tothose observed in UV-irradiated fibroblasts. Furthermore, FOXO1a-peptide induced opposite changes inCOLIAI ,MMP-1 , and MMP-2 expression. Therefore, FOXO1a is involved in the UV-induced changes of type Icollagen and MMPs expression.Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings (2009) 14,60–62; doi:10.1038/jidsymp.2009.2INTRODUCTION
INTRODUCTIONRecently, insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signal-ing has been reported to control life span and senescence inmany organisms, such as nematodes, fruit flies, and mammals(Longo and Finch, 2003). Specifically, insulin/IGF-1 bindingto a specific receptor on the cell surface activates phospha-tidylinositol-3 kinase, followed by protein kinase B activa-tion, which phosphorylates the forkhead box gene, group O(FOXOs) family of forkhead transcription factors (Brunetet al ., 1999). Phosphorylated FOXOs translocate into thecytoplasm, where they are degraded in the ubiquitin–protea-some pathway (Matsuzaki et al., 2003; van der Heide et al.,2004). By stimulating transcription of various target genes,
FOXOs contribute to the regulation of cell growth, differ-entiation, and metabolism (Carlsson and Mahlapuu, 2003;Accili and Arden, 2004). Therefore, the suppression ofFOXOs by insulin/IGF-1 signaling is thought to accelerateaging. In fact, the anti-aging hormone, Klotho, which extendslife span when overexpressed in mice, is reported to inhibitinsulin/IGF-1 signaling and to activate the FOXOs (Kurosuet al ., 2005). Thus, FOXOs is thought to hold a key forcounteracting aging.Solar UV radiation damages human skin and causespremature skin aging, termed photoaging (Gilchrest and Yaar,1992). UV radiation decreases collagen synthesis andincreases the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)in dermal fibroblasts (Fisher et al ., 1996, 2000). Thus, less
synthesis of collagen and increased degradation by MMPswould result in collagen deficiency in photoaged skin.Although FOXOs may play a critical role in aging, the effectsof FOXOs on UV-induced changes in collagen metabolismby dermal fibroblasts are unknown. In this study, UV-inducedchanges in FOXO1a expression and the roles of FOXO1a inregulating collagen synthesis and MMPs expression in humandermal fibroblasts (HDF) were investigated.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONEffects of UV irradiation on FOXO1A ,COLIAI ,MMP-1 , andMMP-2 expression were examined.

decreased significantly within 3 hours after UV irradiation.The expression of COLIAI also decreased significantly. Onthe other hand, MMP-1 andMMP-2 mRNA levels increased(Table 1). UV irradiation induced a decrease in FOXO1Aexpression along with changes in COLIAI and MMPsexpression in dermal fibroblasts. Therefore, we concludethat FOXO1a influences COLIAI and MMPs expression. Tostudy the effects of FOXO1a on COLIAI and MMPsexpression, RNA interference was performed. FOXO1a-smallinterfering RNA (siRNA) transfection caused a significantreduction in FOXO1A expression in HDF (data not shown).This downregulation led to a decrease in COLIAI expressionand increases in MMP-1 and MMP-2 expression (Table 2).This was similar to that observed in UV-irradiated fibroblasts.After this, the effect of FOXO1a-peptide on COLIAI andMMPs expression was examined. By contrast, the addition ofFOXO1a-peptide induced an increase in COLIAI expression
and decreases in MMP-1 and MMP-2 expression (Table 2).We concluded that, FOXO1a is involved in UV-inducedchanges in COLIAI andMMPs expression in HDF.The molecular mechanisms that underlie the changesobserved in COLIAI and MMPs expression in FOXO1aknockdown and FOXO1a-peptide-supplemented fibroblastsare not known. However, we have speculated with respect toseveral possibilities for the mechanisms. It is suggested thatUV irradiation increases activator protein-1 activity, whichinduces the transcription of MMPs (Fisher and Voorhees,1998), but the effect of FOXO1a on activator protein-1activity is not known. It has been reported that FOXO1 caninteract with estrogen receptors and retinoic acid receptors,causing transactivation of nuclear receptor-mediated genes(Schuur et al., 2001; Zhao et al., 2001). Topical 17 b-estradiolincreases the expression of type I procollagen and reducesMMP-1 protein level (Son et al., 2005). In addition, retinoids,
ligands for retinoic acid receptors, are thought to inhibit MMPproduction primarily by affecting the levels of activatorprotein-1 proteins (Schroen and Brinckerhoff, 1996). On thebasis of these reports, it is speculated that the downregulationof FOXO1a may induce a decrease in type I procollagenexpression and increases in MMP-1 and MMP-2 expressionthrough interactions with estrogen receptor and retinoic acidreceptors, which affect the procollagen and MMPs produc-tion. By contrast, the addition of FOXO1a-peptide mayinduce opposing changes. Certainly, further investigation isrequired to elucidate the molecular mechanisms.In conclusion, this study shows that downregulation ofFOXO1a results in a decrease in collagen synthesis and anincrease in MMPs expression in dermal fibroblasts. Thebalance between collagen synthesis and degradation leads tocollagen deficiency, which may be responsible, at least inpart, for the wrinkled quality of photoaged skin. On the other
hand, the addition of FOXO1a-peptide results in opposingchanges. Therefore, FOXO1a is thought to play a substantialrole, at least in part, in skin photoaging, and control ofTable 1.

FOXO1a may be a novel approach to prevent the collagendeficiency observed in photoaged skin.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell cultureHuman dermal fibroblasts (HDF) (NB1RGB) obtained from the RikenCell Bank (Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan) were used in this study. The cellswere incubated in DMEM (Invitrogen Corporation, Grand Island,NY), and were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma,St Louis, MO) at 37 1C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%CO2. Fibroblast cultures were subcultured by trypsinization andused between the fifth and eighth passages.UV irradiation and treatment by FOXO1a-siRNA or FOX-O1a-peptide. For UV irradiation, subconfluent cells were changedwith DMEM without fetal calf serum 2 hours before the irradiation.Just before irradiation, the medium was replaced by phosphate-buffered saline ( /C0). The cells were irradiated with UVA (10 J cm/C02)o rUVB (30 mJ cm/C02) using a solar simulator (XB-25T1W1, Wacom,
Tokyo, Japan) and a health lamp (FL-20SE, Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan),respectively. The cells were then incubated in DMEM for further3 hours.In studies with FOXO1a-siRNA or FOXO1a-peptide, subcon-fluent cells were changed to DMEM without fetal calf serum. RNAinterference was performed using siGENOME SMARTpool (Dhar-macon, Chicago, IL). FOXO1a-siRNAs (100 nM) were transfectedinto cells by lipofection. Non-target siRNAs were transfected intocontrol cells. Similarly, FOXO1a-peptides (1 mgm l/C01, Abcam,Tokyo, Japan) were added to the cells. The cells were then incubatedfor further 24 hours.RNA isolation and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptasePCRTotal RNA was extracted from cultured HDF using TRIZOL Reagent
(Invitrogen Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). mRNA was quantified byreal-time reverse transcriptase PCR using a Super Script III PlatinumSYBR Green Two-step reverse transcriptase PCR Kit (InvitrogenCorporation) and a 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosys-tems, Tokyo, Japan). Primers for FOXO1a, type I collagen, MMP-1,and MMP-2 real-time PCR were as follows: FOXO1a sense primer,50-TCATGGATGGAGATACATTGGATT-30; FOXO1a antisenseprimer, 50-CCAGCTATGTGTCGTTGTCTTGA-30. Type I collagensense primer, 50-TTCTTGCAGTGGTAGGTGATGTTC-30; Type Icollagen antisense primer, 50-GCTACCCAACTTGCCTTCATG-30. MMP-1 sense primer, 50-ATTCTACTGATATCGGGGCTTTGA-30; MMP-1 antisense primer, 50-ATGTCCTTGGGGTATCCGTGTAG-30. MMP-2 sense primer, 50-ACTGAGTGGCCGTGTTTGC-30; MMP-2 antisense primer, 50-CGCTTCTGGCTGGGTCTGT-30. To compare treatment groups, FOXO1A ,COLIAI ,MMP-1 , and MMP-2 levels were quantified on the basis of standardcurves and normalized to the housekeeping gene,
GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), as aninternal control.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors state no conflict of interest.REFERENCESAccili D, Arden KC (2004) FoxOs at the crossroads of cellular metabolism,differentiation, and transformation.
