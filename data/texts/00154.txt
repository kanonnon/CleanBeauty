OPENREVIEWMesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes as a newtherapeutic strategy for liver diseasesGuohua Lou1,2, Zhi Chen1,2, Min Zheng1,2and Yanning Liu1,2The administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a therapy for liver disease holds great promise. MSCs can differentiateinto hepatocytes, reduce liver in ﬂammation, promote hepatic regeneration and secrete protective cytokines. However, the risks ofiatrogenic tumor formation, cellular rejection and infusional toxicity in MSC transplantation remain unresolved. Accumulatingevidence now suggests that a novel cell-free therapy, MSC-secreted exosomes, might constitute a compelling alternativebecause of their advantages over the corresponding MSCs. They are smaller and less complex than their parent cells and, thus,easier to produce and store, they are devoid of viable cells, and they present no risk of tumor formation. Moreover, they are less
immunogenic than their parent cells because of their lower content in membrane-bound proteins. This paper reviews thebiogenesis of MSC exosomes and their physiological functions, and highlights the speci ﬁc biochemical potential of MSC-derivedexosomes in restoring tissue homeostasis. In addition, we summarize the recent advances in the role of exosomes in MSCtherapy for various liver diseases, including liver ﬁbrosis, acute liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma. This paper alsodiscusses the potential challenges and strategies in the use of exosome-based therapies for liver disease in the future.Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2017) 49,e346; doi:10.1038/emm.2017.63; published online 16 June 2017INTRODUCTIONMesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy has emerged asa promising strategy for treating liver diseases via tissue repairand immune regulation.1–3However, the use of MSCs has
some drawbacks, such as the need of a consistent supply of cellswith stable phenotype, high costs and time delays for thegeneration and handling of these cells. In addition, issuesrelated to ectopic tissue formation, infusional toxicity caused bycells lodged in the pulmonary microvasculature, and cellularrejection or unwanted engraftment, have been reported.4Studies have shown that MSCs can achieve a therapeutic effectin vivo via paracrine action5,6and direct differentiation.Subsequent studies indicated that MSC-secreted extracellularvesicles (EVs), including microvesicles (MVs; 0.1 –1m mi ndiameter) and exosomes (40 –100 nm in diameter),7,8maycontribute to the therapeutic potency of MSCs by mediatingcell –cell micro-communication and transporting paracrinefactors during angiogenesis, tissue regeneration and immuneregulation.9–12The administration of MSC-derived exosomes has yieldedbeneﬁcial effects in a variety of animal models of liver disease,
including drug-induced acute liver injury, liver ﬁbrosis andhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).13–16Exosomes have advan-tages over the corresponding MSCs: they are smaller and lesscomplex than cells, so they are easier to produce and store, andhave the potential to avoid some of the regulatory issues thatface MSCs.17Therefore, MSC-derived exosomes may representan ideal therapeutic tool for liver diseases in the near future.FUNCTIONS OF EXOSOMESExosomes are nano-sized EVs that possess remarkable physio-logical properties and originate via the inward budding of themembrane of late endosomes called multivesicular bodies(MVBs). Upon the fusion of MVBs with the plasmamembrane, exosomes are released into the extracellular milieuand can be either taken up by target cells residing in themicroenvironment or carried to distant sites via biologicalﬂuids.18Exosomes have a narrow diameter range of 40 –100 nmand a density of 1.13 –1.19 g ml−1in sucrose solution. They can
be sedimented by centrifugation at 100 000 g.19Exosomemembranes are enriched in cholesterol, sphingomyelin,ceramide and lipid raft proteins.20Exosomes are reported to
be sedimented by centrifugation at 100 000 g.19Exosomemembranes are enriched in cholesterol, sphingomyelin,ceramide and lipid raft proteins.20Exosomes are reported tocontain both proteins and RNAs.21Most exosomes have anevolutionary conserved set of proteins including tetraspanins1State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Af ﬁliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou,China and2Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou, ChinaCorrespondence: Dr Y Liu, State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Af ﬁliated Hospital, Zhejiang University,79# Qingchun Road, 6A-17, Hangzhou 310003, China.E-mail: liuyanning@zju.edu.cnReceived 31 August 2016; revised 3 January 2017; accepted 12 January 2017Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2017) 49, e346; doi:10.1038/emm.2017.63&2017 KSBMB.

(CD81, CD63 and CD9), heat-shock proteins (HSP60, HSP70and HSP90), ALIX and tumor susceptibility gene 101(TSG101); however, they also have unique tissue/celltype-speci ﬁc proteins that re ﬂect their cellular source.22General physiological functions of exosomesExosomes were once thought to be ‘trash bags ’for cells todiscard unwanted proteins. However, over the past decade,they have emerged as an important intercellular communica-tion vehicle for modulating or mediating a variety of cellularprocesses. Exosome release is currently considered an integralmechanism of cell-to-cell communication that may affect bothneighboring cells and distant parts of the body.In the immune system, exosomes have been demonstrated tohave a key role in mediating both adaptive and innate immuneresponses, thereby participating in antigen presentation byspreading antigens in association with MHC-II and MHC-Imolecules. For example, B-lymphocyte- and dendritic cell
(DC)-derived exosomes stimulate T cells and initiate hostimmune responses.23,24When pulsed with tumor peptides,DC-derived exosomes prime cytotoxic T cells and suppresstumor growth in mice.25Interestingly, virally or bacterially infected cells use exosomesas vehicles to disseminate disease.26,27The exosomes that aresecreted from scrapie-infected epithelial and neuroglial cells,which contain infectious prion protein (PrP) scrapie (PrPsc),may contribute to intercellular membrane exchange and thespread of prions throughout the organism.28Exosomes derivedfrom cells infected by human immunode ﬁciency virus type 1,29Epstein –Barr virus,30Herpes simplex virus-131and hepatitis Cvirus32circulate in the bloodstream, attack and enter theirtarget cells. Viruses that are delivered by exosomes are releasedand replicate within them, giving rise to a systematic distribu-tion of viral agents that in ﬂuence the host immune cells.33
Similar to virally infected cells, bacterially infected cells suchas Mycobacterium tuberculosis- ,Mycobacterium bovis- orMycobacterium avium -infected macrophages release exosomesthat contain pathogen-derived antigens,34which have animportant role in immune surveillance during intracellularbacterial infections.Cancer cells also utilize exosomes in tumor progression andmetastasis. Highly metastatic melanoma cell-derived exosomescan promote epithelial –mesenchymal transition in primarymelanocytes.35Glioblastoma multiforme cell-derived hypoxicexosomes can secrete and transfer potent growth factorsinto vascular cells to promote tumor vascularization duringtumor development.36Tumors such as melanoma and color-ectal carcinoma also secrete exosomes to induce immuno-suppressive myeloid cells and possibly enable tumors to evadet h ei m m u n es y s t e m .37The nucleic acid content of exosomesalso appears to be important in tumor metastasis; for instance,
the PTEN-targeting microRNAs, which are transferred byastrocyte-derived exosomes, enhance brain metastasisoutgrowth.38Recently, exosomes have also been implicated in degenerativediseases. In Parkinson ’s and Alzheimer ’s patients, neuron-secreted exosomes containing α-synuclein39and amyloid- βpeptide (A β),40respectively, have been reported. Theseexosomes can contribute to the nucleation or physicaldissemination of the α-synuclein and A βaggregates thatcharacterize the two diseases. Another study showed thatexosomes from interleukin-1 β(IL-1 β)-stimulated humansynovial ﬁbroblasts could induce osteoarthritis-like changesin both in vitro and ex vivo models: this might representa novel mechanism involving osteoarthritis-affected jointsvia pathogenic signal communication.41Moreover, exosomes are emerging as mediators in tissueregeneration. During injury, cardiomyocyte progenitor cellssecrete exosomes to stimulate the migration of endothelial cells
and promote cardiac regenerative activity.42Exosomes have
regeneration. During injury, cardiomyocyte progenitor cellssecrete exosomes to stimulate the migration of endothelial cellsand promote cardiac regenerative activity.42Exosomes havealso been shown to be involved in the regeneration ofperipheral nerves and in the repair of neuronal injuries.43Furthermore, their ability to cross the blood –brain barrierhas prompted extensive investigations to use them as deliveryvehicles to treat neurological disorders.44Functions of MSC-derived exosomesThe physiological function of MSC-derived exosomes has notbeen de ﬁned. They may act as an intercellular communicationvehicle for modulating or mediating cellular processes, similarto the exosomes derived from cell types. MSC-derived exosomesmay interact with multiple cell types within adjacent and remoteareas to elicit appropriate cellular responses; they affect thestromal support functions of MSCs through the maintenance ofa dynamic and homeostatic tissue microenvironment.45
45Similar to exosomes in general, MSC-derived exosomescarry complex cargo, including nucleic acids, proteins andlipids. Through mass spectrometry, antibody array andmicroarray analysis, 4850 unique gene products and 4150miRNAs have been identi ﬁed in the cargo of MSC-derivedexosomes.46,47These exosomal proteins and miRNAs arefunctionally complex, and are implicated in many diversebiochemical and cellular processes, such as communication,immune regulation, bioenergetics, tissue repair and regenera-tion and metabolism. Thus, MSC-derived exosomes display thepotential to elicit diverse cellular responses and interact withvarious cell types.MSC-derived exosomes have a key role in mediating thecapacity of MSCs to function as stromal support cells tomaintain homeostasis within the tissue and respond to externalstimuli. This role is particularly important when the home-
ostasis of the tissue microenvironment is disrupted by diseaseor injury; this, in turn, compromises normal tissue function.MSC-derived exosomes are highly enriched in biologicallyactive molecules, such as proteins and RNAs, and are thereforewell equipped for this role.48Many of the proteins found inexosomes are enzymes, with activities that are catalytic ratherthan stoichiometric and are dictated by their microenviron-ment (for example, substrate concentration or pH). Therefore,the enzyme-centric feature of exosomes may alleviate the riskof over- or under-dosing if they are used as therapeuticalagents.49As i g n i ﬁcant clustering of glycolytic enzymes has beenMSC exosome therapy in liver diseaseGL o u et al2Experimental & Molecular Medicine
found in MSC exosomes; if they are given as therapy, theseenzymes from MSC exosomes can ameliorate the glycolyticdeﬁcit and potentially increase glycolytic ﬂux and ATPproduction in the reperfused myocardium.50Moreover, exosomes are the ideal vehicles to protectand deliver molecules to the appropriate targets. By encapsu-lating molecules within their membranes, exosomes canprotect enzymes or RNAs against degradation and facilitatetheir intracellular uptake via the cellular endocytosis ofexosomes.51,52The uptake of exosomes has been reported tobe modi ﬁed by microenvironmental acidity,53and tissue injuryis often characterized by tissue acidosis.54Exosomes would bepreferentially taken up by cells in injured tissues. Furthermore,exosomes are nanometer-sized particles that can be easilytransferred through blood and other biological ﬂuids. Thus,MSC-derived exosomes can mediate cell communication inboth adjacent and remote areas via paracrine and endocrine
signaling. The capacity of MSC-derived exosomes to restoreand maintain the homeostasis of the tissue microenvironmentwould depend on the biochemical potential of their proteinand RNA cargo.THERAPEUTIC PROPERTIES OF MSC-DERIVEDEXOSOMES ON LIVER DISEASEThe unique ability of MSCs to self-renew and their multi-potentiality have made them a promising cell-based strategyfor treating liver diseases. Recent studies have shown thatMSC-derived exosomes are as potent as parent stem cells in theregeneration of various organ injury models, primarily throughthe transfer of their cargo to the recipient cells, which areconsequently modi ﬁed in their function and/or phenotype.55,56As shown in Table 1, multiple recent studies have presentedpreclinical data addressing the reparative and regenerativeproperties of MSC-derived exosomes in liver diseases.13–16,57MSC-derived exosomes for liver ﬁbrosisThe application of MSCs in animal models of liver ﬁbrosis/
cirrhosis and, eventually, in patients ameliorates the progressof the disease.58Similar results were obtained when MSC-conditioned media (MSC-CM) were applied instead,58,59whichsuggests that MSCs might achieve a therapeutic effect in vivovia their secreted EVs, such as exosomes.Several studies have focused on the therapeutic effects ofMSC-derived exosomes in a mouse model of liver ﬁbrosis.Using a carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4)-induced liver injury modelin Kunming mice, Li et al. found that the exosomes derivedfrom human umbilical cord MSCs ameliorate liver ﬁbrosisby inhibiting both the epithelial –mesenchymal transition ofhepatocytes and collagen production. Exosomes were found tosigniﬁcantly restore the serum aspartate aminotransferaseactivity and inactivate the TGF- β1/Smad signaling pathway bydecreasing collagen type I/III and TGF- β1 and the phosphor-ylation of Smad2.14Another study showed that chorionic plate-derived MSCs could release exosomes containing miR-125b,
mediate miR-125b transfer between MSCs and target cells,such as Hedgehog (Hh)-responsive hepatic stellate cells(HSCs), and thus alleviate hepatic ﬁbrosis in CCl 4-treatedSprague –Dawley rats by impeding the activation of Hhsignaling via the inhibition of Smo expression.15Ourunpublished data showed that the exosomes produced byadipose tissue-derived MSCs (AD-MSC-122) expressingmiR-122 were more effective than were those expressingscramble miRNA or naive exosomes in reducing the prolifera-tion and activation of the human HSC cell line LX2 or primaryHSCs from C57BL/6 mice. AD-MSC-122-derived exosomescould transfer miR-122 into HSCs cells and then regulate theexpression of miR-122-target genes, such as P4HA1 andIGF1R, which have been shown to be involved in theproliferation and collagen maturation of HSCs.60,61Thesedata indicate that miR-122-modi ﬁcation may improve thetherapeutic ef ﬁcacy of AD-MSCs via exosome-mediatedmiR-122 delivery, thereby representing a new strategy for
treating liver ﬁbrosis.

In acute kidney injury models induced by cisplatin,62glycerol,63ischemia-reperfusion (I/R),64nephrectomy65and drugtoxicity (gentamicin),66MSC exosomes or MVs can improverenal function and reduce the extent of kidney damage. A singleadministration of MSC exosomes immediately followingcisplatin- or I/R-induced acute kidney injury alleviates in ﬂamma-tion, mitigates renal cell apoptosis, and enhances the proliferationof renal epithelial cells.10,62In myocardial I/R injury, theadministration of puri ﬁed MSC exosomes before reperfusionsigniﬁcantly reduces the infarct size and improves the
left ventricular function.67,68Further studies have shown thatMSC-derived exosomes exert protective effects against myocardialI/R injury possibly through several mechanisms, such asanti-apoptosis, cardiac regeneration, anti-cardiac remodeling,anti-in ﬂammatory effects, neovascularization and anti-vascularremodeling.69,70However, to date, only a few groups have studied thetherapeutic effects of MSC exosomes in acute liver injury.13Tan et al. found that HuES9.E1 MSC-derived exosomes elicithepatoprotective effects both in in vitro models of acetamino-phen or H 2O2-induced hepatocyte injury and in a C57BL/6mouse model of CCl 4-induced acute liver injury, primarilythrough an increase in hepatocyte proliferation, as demon-strated by elevated proliferating cell nuclear antigen and highcell viability. The increased survival rate is associated with theupregulation of genes involved in the priming phase liverregeneration, which subsequently lead to high expression of
proliferation proteins (proliferating cell nuclear antigen andCyclin D1), the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-xL and the signaltransducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). However,the therapeutic effect of MSC-derived exosomes does not occurvia the modulation of oxidative stress during hepatic injury.13At the CSH-AASLD & CSH-EASL Joint Scienti ﬁc Symposiumsmeeting on Hepatology (Beijing, 2016), we presented ourstudy indicating that transplantation of exosomes releasedMSC exosome therapy in liver diseaseGL o u et al3Experimental & Molecular Medicine
from AD-MSC can signi ﬁcantly reduce the elevated serumlevels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransfer-ase, liver in ﬂammation and necrosis in concanavalin A(Con A)-induced hepatitis in C57BL/6 mice as well as theserum levels of proin ﬂammatory cytokines, including tumornecrosis factor- α(TNF- α), interferon- γ(IFN- γ), IL-6, IL-18and IL-1 β, and the in ﬂammasome activation in mouse liver.MSCs offer an opportunity to treat acute liver injuryinduced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS),71thioacetamide,72I/R,73and radiation,74and MSC-CM has been shown to exerta protective effect on these models.75,76Thus, we have reasonto believe that the transplantation of MSC-derived exosomesmay be a novel therapeutic approach for treating various typesof acute liver injury.MSC-derived exosomes for HCCMSCs have recently gained much attention for their applicationto tumor therapy because MSCs can mobilize from the bonemarrow or other tissues to the tumor microenvironment.77,78
Several studies have shown that MSCs can either promote orinhibit tumor progression in different tumor models.79–82However, the mechanisms by which MSCs control tumor cellsremain unclear.MSC-secreted paracrine facto rs, which are delivered by EVs,have been shown to mediate their effects on tumorprogression.83For example, exosomes that are released frommultiple myeloma patient bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCsp r o m o t em u l t i p l em y e l o m at u m o rg r o w t hi nS C I D - b e i g em i c e .84MVs derived from human Wharton ’s jelly MSCs promote renalcancer cell growth and aggressiveness in BALB/c nu/nu mice.85BM-MSC-derived exosomes promote gastric or colon tumorgrowth in BALB/c nu/nu mice by enhancing the expression ofvascular endothelial growth factor in tumor cells,86and theyfacilitate nasopharyngeal carcinoma progression and migrationin non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunode ﬁcient(NOD/SCID) mice by activating the FGF19-FGFR4-dependent
ERK signaling cascade and epithelial –mesenchymal transition.87However, exosomes also exhibit anti-tumor effects. Bruno et al.88found that exosomes from human BM-MSCs inhibit the growthand survival of three different human tumor cell lines, andsimilar results were observed in NOD/SCID mouse models. Inanother study, mouse BM-MSC-derived exosomes were foundto suppress tumor progression and angiogenesis in the mousebreast cancer cell line 4T1 by downregulating the expression ofvascular endothelial growth factor in vitro and in vivo viashuttling miR-16, which is a known effector of vascularendothelial growth factor that is enriched in MSC-derivedexosomes.89A different study showed that exosomes derivedfrom menstrual stem cells suppress the secretion ofpro-angiogenic factors in pro state tumor cell line PC3 in areactive oxygen species-dependent manner and inhibit angiogen-esis of prostate tumor in PC3-bearing NOD SCID gammamice.
90The different effects of MSC-derived exosomes on tumorgrowth may be due to the heterogeneity of MSCs. MSCs fromdifferent donors or tissue sources may release exosomes contain-ing cell-speci ﬁc molecules to promote or prevent tumor devel-opment. In addition, the different tumor types and in vivo tumormodels examined and the variation in the way and timeexosomes are administered may also in ﬂuence the effect ofexosomes on tumor progression.91To date, only a few studies have shown the effect of MSCexosomes on HCC. MVs derived from BM-MSCs inhibit cellcycle progression and induce apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Theintra-tumor administration of MVs in established tumorsgenerated by a subcutaneous injection of HepG2 cells in SCIDmice signi ﬁcantly inhibits tumor growth.88A recent studyshowed that AD-MSC-derived exosomes in rat N1S1 cells,which is an orthotopic HCC model, can promote NKTcell anti-tumor responses in rats, thereby facilitating HCC

and chemosensitivity in HepG2 cell xenografts in BALB/cnu/nu mice. Because miR-122 has an essential role in increas-ing the chemosensitivity of HCC cells by targeting CCNG1,ADAM10 and IGF1R, we modi ﬁed AD-MSCs with miR-122.Exosomes from miR-122-modi ﬁed AD-MSC (122-Exo) couldmediate miR-122 transfer between AD-MSCs and HCC cells,thereby enhancing cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agentsby regulating miR-122-target gene expression in HCC cells.Moreover, an intra-tumor injection of 122-Exo signi ﬁcantlysensitizes HCC to sorafenib therapy in vivo .57The differentanti-cancer effects of AD-MSC-derived exosomes on HCCbetween our study and the study performed by Ko et al. in a ratmodel may be due to differences in the tumor model of HCCinvestigated. In a previous study, Ko et al.16used N1S1 ratHCC cells to obtain an orthotopic HCC model in Fischer-344
(F344) rats, which have a normal immune system. They foundthat AD-MSC-derived exosomes promote NKT cell anti-tumorresponses in rats, thereby facilitating HCC suppression. Thisﬁnding suggests that the anti-cancer effect of AD-MSC-derivedexosomes is mainly by promoting anti-cancer immunity.In our study, we used HepG2 human HCC cells to constructa subcutaneous xenograft model in nude mice in whichthe immune-mediated anti-cancer effect of AD-MSC-derivedexosomes could not be observed.The use of MSC-derived exosomes in cancer therapy mustbe conducted with caution because their role in tumor growthremains unclear. A better understanding of the mechanismsinvolved in the regulation of MSC-derived exosomes isimportant to determine their true role in cancer progressionand guide researchers in the development of importanttherapeutic agents through their speci ﬁcm o d i ﬁcation.MSC-derived exosomes for drug delivery
MSC-derived exosomes for drug deliveryAdvances in biomedical research have generated an increasingnumber of potential targets for treating liver disease or delayingdisease progression. Unfortunately, many of these targets areundruggable because they are intracellular, present in manycell types, poorly soluble or rapidly inactivated. Althoughpharmaceutical drug vehicles (for example, synthetic lipidand nanoparticles), have successfully circumvented many ofthese problems, exosomes, as a mimic of ‘nature ’sd e l i v e r ysystems, ’are highly attractive as a potential alternativeto deliver drugs to target cells via membrane fusion orendocytosis. Given the problems associated with many of thecurrent nanoparticulate delivery systems, exosomes can avoidphagocytosis or degradation by macrophages and also circulatefor extended time periods within the body because of nature ’s
own cellular product. Unlike typical nanoparticulate systemssuch as liposomes or polymeric nanoparticles, exosomes canpotentially avoid the endosomal pathway and lysosomaldegradation, and deliver cargoes directly into the cytoplasm.By avoiding the endosomal pathway, the transfection ef ﬁciencyfor molecules such as siRNA can be enhanced.94Moreover,
for molecules such as siRNA can be enhanced.94Moreover,exosomes have other features of an ideal drug delivery vehicle.First, the presence of proteins and RNAs in exosomes indicatesthat they can be loaded with such biological materials.95Second, exosomes can penetrate the blood –brain barrier,96which has proven to be highly impenetrable to many drugs.Third, exosomes are naturally stable and have inherenttargeting properties depending on their composition.97,98Finally, exosomes are amenable to membrane modi ﬁcationsthat enhance cell type-speci ﬁc targeting.99,100Among the cell types that are known to produce exosomes,MSC are the ideal candidate for the mass production ofexosomes for drug delivery. At present, MSC-derived exosomeshave been used as drug delivery vehicles in tumor therapy andregenerative medicine in some studies.101,102Upon in vitro
101,102Upon in vitroexposure to high concentrations of paclitaxel (PTX), BM-MSCscan package and deliver this active drug through theirexosomes. The PTX-loaded exosomes acquire stronganti-tumor effects on human pancreatic adenocarcinoma(CFPAC-1), in vitro .103Exosomes from BM-MSCs overexpres-sing miR-146b or miR-143 can signi ﬁcantly reduce the growthof glioma xenografts in a Fischer rat model or the migration ofosteosarcoma cells in vitro , through delivery of these anti-tumor miRNAs into the target tissue or cells, respectively.104,105BM-MSCs loaded with anti-miR-9 can transfer this anti-miRinto co-cultured-glioblastoma cells via secreted exosomes,thereby conferring temozolomide chemosensitivity.93In addition to their use in tumor therapy or chemotherapy,MSC exosome-shuttled therapeutic materials have been used inregenerative medicine. CXCR4-enriched exosomes releasedfrom CXCR4-overexpressing rat BM-MSCs can protectcardiomyocytes from ischemic injury both in vitro and in
a rat model of myocardial infarction. Upregulation of theAkt signaling pathway contributes to these bene ﬁcial effects,suggesting that CXCR4-enriched exosomes may serve as anadditional therapeutic strategy to promote cell survival andangiogenesis in ischemic hearts following myocardialinfarction.106To date, there are few studies on the use of MSC-derivedexosomes for drug delivery in liver diseases. Because speci ﬁcallymodi ﬁed MSCs and their conditioned media show bettertherapeutic ef ﬁcacy on liver diseases1,107, and because exosomesthat contain therapeutic molecules can be mass produced fromMSC exosome therapy in liver diseaseGL o u et al5Experimental & Molecular Medicine
MSCs, exosome-mediated drug delivery potentially engendersa novel approach for treating liver diseases such as hepatitis,liver ﬁbrosis and HCC.CONCLUSIONS AND PROSPECTSAs stromal support cells, MSCs target housekeeping processesthrough their secreted exosomes to restore liver homeostasisand enable hepatocytes to recover, repair and regenerate. Thisobservation provides the rationale for the therapeutic ef ﬁcacyof MSCs and their secreted exosomes in a variety ofliver diseases. Furthermore, by maintaining the therapeuticadvantages of MSCs without the risk of iatrogenic tumorformation or of pulmonary embolisms due to intravenousadministration, MSC-derived exosomes represent a highlyattractive therapeutic approach for treating in ﬂammatoryliver diseases and HCC. Such exosomes also can be used asan adjuvant to support and complement other therapeuticmodalities (Figure 1).However, questions about the characterization, potency and
quanti ﬁcation of MSC exosomes must be addressed beforetheir clinical use. On the basis of preclinical studies, theamount of MSC exosomes needed to generate an equivalenteffect as MSCs in tissue injury is roughly higher.7AlthoughMSCs are relatively easy to expand in vitro , their growth inculture is ﬁnite. Both new batches of MSCs, through immor-talization and expansion by bioreactors, and more effectivetechniques for large-scale exosome production need to bedeveloped. Moreover, there is still no gold standard tocharacterize MSC exosomes. Because MSCs are heterogeneous,the exosomes isolated from them are also heterogeneous, andthis heterogeneity may cause different effects on their targetcells.84,108In addition, the methods used to precondition MSCin stimulating exosome release, such as serum starvation,hypoxia and in ﬂammation, change the surface and intracellularcontent of exosomes. Thus, to signi ﬁcantly advance exosome-
mediated therapy in clinical trials, effective methods thatmaintain the homogeneity of MSC-derived exosomes, involverobust and standardized characterization of MSC-derivedexosomes, and include standardized safety data from preclinicalanimal models need to be developed.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors declare no con ﬂict of interest.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Fund(81000730 and 81201782), and the Key R&D projects of the Zhejiangprovince (2015C03045).1 Kim MD, Kim SS, Cha HY, Jang SH, Chang DY, Kim W et al.
