Plants have mul-tiple photosensory receptors to detect the presence of competitors and thereby adjust their growth anddevelopmental strategies accordingly. Broadly speaking, plants fall into two categories depending on theirresponse to shading by leaves: shade tolerant or shade avoiding. Here, we describe the photoperceptionmechanisms and the growth responses elicited by the neighboring vegetation in shade-avoiding plants,focusing on Arabidopsis thaliana , where these responses are best understood. The type of response
depends on plant density, ranging from neighbor detection modulating growth in anticipation of futureshading to the response to canopy shade where light resources are limiting. These diverse environmentsare sensed by various photoreceptors, and we will describe our current understanding of signal integrationtriggered by distinct light cues in diverse light conditions.IntroductionPlants perceive direct sunlight in open habitats or at the top ofthe canopy but have to face daily and seasonal ﬂuctuations oflight composition. While the spectral composition of solar radia-tion is rather constant during the day, it is signiﬁcantly enriched inblue and far-red wavelengths at twilight. Clouds further reducethe incoming light up to 90%, but without a major effect on thecolor spectrum [1]. Light composition also changes during theyear, particularly at high latitudes when the sun remains low onthe horizon, and it has been proposed that plants use this color
information in addition to photoperiod to adapt to seasonalchanges [2].Once sunlight reaches a plant, it is used as a source of energyfor photosynthesis through absorption by chlorophyll and otherpigments composing the photosynthetic apparatus. Photosyn-thetically active radiation approximately corresponds to thespectrum visible to the human eye (400–700 nm) but light ab-sorption by photosynthetic pigments occurs especially in theblue (400–500 nm) and red (600–700 nm). In parallel, a largepart of far-red light (700–750 nm) is transmitted or reﬂected byplant tissues ( Figure 1 A). These spectral properties of aerial planttissues have a great inﬂuence on light composition available toplants, particularly when considering their ecological context.Even in open habitats, plants are rarely isolated and are mostlyfound within communities, where competition for light betweenplants of equivalent height is high. This is the case in natural sit-
uations, such as meadows or clearings, and agricultural ﬁelds. Insuch environments, plants detect the presence of neighboringcompetitors through an increased perception of reﬂected far-red light leading to a low red to far-red (R/FR) ratio, withoutany major drop in the global amount of light ( Figure 1 B)[3].I nshade-avoiding plants, this so-called neighbor detection triggersa suite of morphological adaptations which are thought to helpoutgrow competitors: elongation of stem-like structures, eleva-tion of leaves, as well as reduced branching and accelerationof ﬂowering. Such morphological and developmental changesare associated with an increased ﬁtness in competitive environ-ments but occur at the expense of biomass production [4–6] .A nadditional apparent cost of the shade avoidance strategy is thereduced ability of such plants to defend themselves against avariety of pathogens [7]and to develop symbiotic interactionswith micro-organisms [8].

with micro-organisms [8].A drop in the R/FR ratio serves as an early signal of a formingcanopy, indicating that plants will soon face unfavorable condi-tions [9]. With the closure of the canopy, light quantity decreasesprogressively as the leaf area index increases [10,11] . Most ofthe blue, red and UV-B wavelengths are absorbed by leafcovering, and the resulting ﬁltered light is relatively enriched ingreen and far-red ( Figure 1 A). These conditions are thus charac-terized by both a low photosynthetically active radiation and alow R/FR ratio. In such conditions, shade-avoiding species,such as most crops (tomato, cereals, legumes, etc.), displayelongation phenotypes, a quantitative response increasing ac-cording to plant density [12]. However, many herbaceous spe-cies living under closed canopies, such as forest understory,cannot outcompete tall trees and have developed strategies ofshade-tolerance to cope with dim light and to optimize light cap-
ture[13]. For example, a Begonia species living under a tropicalcanopy has specialized epidermal chloroplasts or iridoplastswhose physical properties enhance light harvesting and photo-synthetic yield under low light conditions, especially in the greenrange of the spectrum [14]. Moreover, recent comparison of twoclosely related Geranium species highlight the contrastedgrowth and gene expression patterns as well as the oppositeregulation of defense genes between shade tolerant versusavoiding species [15].Natural canopies are not homogeneous environments. Leafcover is often uneven, providing some plants with transientaccess to unﬁltered sunlight depending on the position of thesun or the time of day. These sunﬂecks inhibit the shade avoid-ance response (e.g. stem growth), especially when occurring inthe afternoon [16]. Gaps in canopies also provide potentialaccess to unﬁltered sunlight and represent a good opportunity
for plants to get higher amounts of light for photosynthesis.In such conditions, plants tend to reorientate their growthtowards the more favorable light environment [17]. This isCurrent Biology 27, R931–R940, September 11, 2017 ª2017 Elsevier Ltd. R931
particularly visible at the edge of a canopy where plants are sub-mitted to a stable lateral light gradient ( Figure 1 B,C), triggeringdirectional growth or phototropism, with stem-like structuresbending to reposition photosynthetic organs for optimized lightabsorption [17–19] .In this review, we describe how light perception modulates theextent and direction of plant growth leading to enhanced lightharvesting for photosynthesis.

The light environment and effectson plant growth.(A) Leaf spectral properties as the main determi-nant for light composition in plant communities.Upon absorption of sunlight (top spectrum) byphotosynthetic pigments, a leaf ﬁlters most of theblue and red wavelengths and the resulting trans-mitted light is relatively enriched in green and far-red (bottom spectrum). Besides, green tissues alsoreﬂect far-red, which lowers the R/FR ratioperceived by neighboring plants (spectra adaptedfrom [116] ). (B) Plant growth responses in differentlight environments. Full sunlight: an isolated plantunder full sunlight receives high amounts of UV-B,blue and red light and relatively low amounts of far-red (top spectrum in 1A). Neighbor detection: incrowded environments, high reﬂection of far-redlight from neighboring plants is a signal for strong
competition and indicates a forming canopy.The decrease in R/FR ratio perceived by plantphotoreceptors induces a suite of morphologicalchanges helping to overtop encroaching neighborsand get a better access to sunlight: elongation ofstem, internodes and petioles, leaf elevation (hy-ponasty), reduced branching and acceleration ofﬂowering. True shade: under a canopy, light isstrongly ﬁltered by high tree leaves and the un-derstory receives a much lower light intensity,characterized by low UV-B, low photosyntheticallyactive radiation and low R/FR (bottom spectrumin 1A). This leads to a similar but more pronouncedphenotypic response than described in shade-avoiding species. Conversely, shade-tolerantplants display various adaptations to life under dimlight conditions (not represented here). Finally,plants located at the edge of a canopy gap face ahorizontal light gradient, which induces a reor-

We will primarily concen-trate on Arabidopsis thaliana , a shade-avoiding plant, because most of themolecular mechanisms underlying theseresponses have been identiﬁed in thisspecies.Photoreceptors Regulating GrowthDepending on Plant DensityPlants use light parameters, such as spec-tral composition, light intensity, directionand duration, as a source of informationfrom the environment to modulate growthand control developmental transitions.Different classes of photoreceptors perceive speciﬁc ranges ofthe light spectrum: cryptochromes, phototropins and Zeitlupesabsorb blue/UV-A light, phytochromes maximally absorb redand far-red but also absorb blue light, and UVR8 absorbs UV-B(280–315 nm) [20]. With the notable exception of UVR8, photore-
ceptors are chromoproteins composed of an apoprotein and alight-absorbing chromophore. UVR8 uses a triad of photosensi-tive tryptophane residues to absorb light [21]. Three classes of

cryptochromes and UVR8 [22]. Phototropism is primarily inducedby directional UV-A/blue light perceived by the phototropin fam-ily, but plants can also bend towards UV-B [23]. The crosstalk be-tween these different photosensory systems will be describedbelow. In contrast, we will not discuss members of the Zeitlupefamily, which are primarily involved in the control of ﬂoral transi-tion and entrainment of the circadian clock (for more informationabout Zeitlupes, see [20,24] ).Although phototropism is not typically regarded as a compo-nent of plant responses to a crowded environment, directionalgrowth contributes to phenotypic plasticity in such environments[19,25,26] . We will thus start by a brief description of signalingevents associated with phototropism. Angiosperms possesstwo phototropin photoreceptors, phot1 and phot2, with partiallyoverlapping roles in several physiological responses to blue lightlike phototropism, stomatal opening or leaf ﬂattening ﬁnally lead-
ing to optimized photosynthetic activity. Phot1 functions over abroad range of intensities whereas phot2 is only active at highblue light intensities [27].Phototropins belong to the AGC kinase family and are locatedat the plasma membrane. They are composed of two blue light-sensing LOV (light oxygen voltage) domains and a carboxy-ter-minal serine/threonine kinase domain. Upon blue light percep-tion, a conformational change releases the kinase activityrepressed by LOV2, leading to the subsequent autophosphory-lation of phototropins [24,28] . This is followed by a cascade ofsignaling events ﬁnally resulting in the establishment of an auxingradient driving directional growth towards the light ( Box 1 ).Early signaling components have been identiﬁed, but the link be-tween activation of phototropins and the auxin gradient is still notentirely elucidated ( Figure 2 A). For example, NPH3 and RPT2,two proteins from the same family, are essential for a proper
phototropism response [29]. They are both located at the plasmamembrane and interact with phot1 [24,28] . NPH3 is rapidly de-phosphorylated in blue light in a phot1-dependent manner[24,28] , a phenomenon which is modulated by RPT2 [30].NPH3 associates with Cullin3 in a CUL3-based E3 ligase com-plex, which regulates phot1 ubiquitination [31]. However, thefunctional consequences of this post-translational modiﬁcationof phot1 remain poorly understood. The PKS family of proteinsare also considered as early signal transducers required forphototropism, among which PKS4 is a direct target of phot1phosphorylation [32]. PKS proteins were proposed to act up-stream of auxin gradient formation but their biochemical modeof action remains unknown [33]. (For further details on phototro-pin signaling, see [24,28,29,34] ).Photoreceptors and Early Signaling Events RegulatingElongationIn contrast to the phototropins, phytochromes, cryptochromes
and UVR8 are not anchored to the plasma membrane but mainlyfunction in the nucleus. Interestingly, despite having different ac-tion spectra, they show similar features in terms of signalingmechanisms which converge to the modulation of gene expres-sion through regulation of transcription factors ( Figure 2 B).Below, we provide a synthetic overview of early signaling eventsassociated with light regulation of elongation; more comprehen-sive reviews on the function and signaling mechanisms elicited bythese photosensory receptors can be found in [21,24,35–37] .Plants possess several phytochrome photoreceptors withpartially overlapping roles — there are ﬁve in Arabidopsis ,phyA–E — and functioning as homo- or heterodimers. Phyto-chromes exist in two forms: a far-red absorbing form (Pfr) andits more stable red-absorbing conformer (Pr). Upon perceptionof red light, the inactive Pr is converted into the active Pfr which
translocates into the nucleus. Conversion from Pfr to Pr is facil-itated by FR light perception. However, this also occurs slowly in
translocates into the nucleus. Conversion from Pfr to Pr is facil-itated by FR light perception. However, this also occurs slowly inthe dark. This so-called ‘dark reversion’ is temperature-depen-dent and participates in plant perception and response to tem-perature variations, suggesting that phytochromes also functionas thermosensors [38–40] . Cryptochromes are related to thefamily of DNA repair-involved photolyases and are found inmany eukaryotic clades, including fungi and animals, as wellas in some bacteria [41]. Two cryptochrome photoreceptors,cry1 and cry2, are present in Arabidopsis and are activated byblue light through conformational changes [36]. UVR8 is themost recently identiﬁed plant photoreceptor and is involved inphysiological and developmental responses to UV-B [21,42] .UV-B perception allows the conversion of UVR8 homodimersto active monomers.In all cases, light activation of these photoreceptors enables
controlled interactions with downstream signaling components,Box 1. Auxin, the plant growth hormone.Auxin is the main hormonal regulator of cell elongation in shade avoidance and phototropism responses in plants. In young seed-lings, it is mostly produced in the cotyledons and channeled down to the hypocotyl and root [73]. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), themain auxin form, is primarily synthetized from tryptophan through the TAA1-YUC pathway. TAA1 converts tryptophan into indole-3-pyruvate (IPA) and enzymes of the YUCCA (YUC) family are responsible for converting IPA into free IAA in a rate-limiting step [74].Auxin is then transported from cell to cell in a directional manner through controlled transport routes. The fast and long-rangebasipetal stream of auxin corresponds to the polar auxin transport whereas a slower local distribution of auxin to the different tis-
sues has recently been identiﬁed as the connective auxin transport [117] . Auxin freely enters the cell in its protonated form, themost abundant one at the acidic pH of the apoplast. Once in the cytoplasm, auxin is deprotonated and is thus ‘trapped’ insidethe cell. Its transport is also regulated by three families of transporters: AUX1/LAX auxin inﬂux carriers enable auxin to enterinto the cell whereas auxin efﬂux is mediated by both the apolar ABCBs and the polar PIN transporters [118] . ABCB and PIN ac-tivities are regulated by phosphorylation by AGC VIII kinases [119] . Auxin is perceived in the cytoplasm by speciﬁc receptors fromthe TIR/AFB family and favors the interaction of SCFTIR/AFBE3 ligase complexes with Aux/IAA proteins, which are targeted to theproteasome. Degradation of Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors releases the activity of ARF transcription factors which then drive
expression of speciﬁc auxin-responsive genes, among which are cell wall remodeling factors involved in cell elongation [120] .Current Biology 27, R931–R940, September 11, 2017 R933Current BiologyReview
which ﬁnally leads to regulation of gene expression via two mainmechanisms. Phytochromes and cryptochromes have a directimpact on transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix(bHLH) family, especially on phytochrome interacting factors(PIFs) ( Figure 2 B). PIFs are central integrators of internal andexternal cues regulating plant growth and development[43–45] . They are conserved in land plants, pointing to an earlyevolutionary origin of this signaling module [46,47] .Arabidopsishas eight PIF/PIF-like proteins which can interact with phyBbut only play partially overlapping roles at different stages ofdevelopment: PIF1, PIF3-8 and PIL1/PIF2 [44]. Notably, whilemost PIFs have a growth-promoting function, PIF6 and PIL1/PIF2 tend to have opposite effects on growth [44]. PIFs regulateexpression of target genes by binding preferentially to promoterregions enriched in G-box and PBE-box (PIF-binding E-box) mo-tifs[43]. Active phyB interacts with PIFs in the nucleus and in-
hibits their activity [43]. In many cases, this interaction leads tophosphorylation and further proteasome-dependent degrada-tion of PIFs. Interestingly, PIF7 is not degraded upon interactionwith phyB but accumulates in a phosphorylated form [48]. Addi-tionally, phytochromes may act directly at the chromatin level onthe promoters of PIF target genes. PhyB is detected on chro-matin [39], and active phyB inhibits the binding of PIF1 andPIF3 to the PIL1 promoter independently of the degradationprocesses [49]. Recently, both crys have also been shown tophysically interact with PIF4 and PIF5 in vitro and in vivo[50,51] . However how these interactions affect PIF activity is stillnot fully understood. One possibility is that crys repress PIFs’transcriptional activity by interacting directly with PIFs at theirtarget genes [51]. Cry2 also interacts with CIB bHLH transcrip-tion factors, in a blue-light-dependent manner, but this rather
stimulates CIB-induced expression of target genes to initiateﬂowering [52]. Cryptochrome-dependent regulation of geneexpression may thus vary depending on the type of bHLH factorinvolved [36].Conversely, all three photoreceptors suppress the activity ofthe COP1/SPA ubiquitin E3 ligase through different mecha-nisms, ultimately leading to the stabilization of transcription fac-tors like HY5 ( Figure 2 B)[53]. HY5 regulates many target genesto promote photomorphogenesis and inhibit hypocotyl elonga-tion[54]. In the dark, COP1 together with SPAs acts as substratereceptor in a CUL4–DDB1 E3 ligase to recruit HY5 for poly-ubiq-uitination and further degradation by the proteasome. Light-acti-vated cryptochromes and phytochromes interact with SPA,which disrupts or inactivates COP1/SPA complexes, thereby in-hibiting their ubiquitin E3 ligase activity [55–58] . HY5 is also sta-
bilized under UV-B, and initial models considered COP1 as apositive regulator of UV-B-dependent photomorphogenesis[21]. However, monomeric light-activated UVR8 sequestersCOP1, which limits COP1 association with the CUL4-DDB1 E3ligase and thus promotes HY5 stabilization [21,59] , indicatingthat UVR8 has a negative effect on COP1 activity. Photore-ceptor-mediated control of COP1/SPA activity also affects theabundance of other negative modulators of shade-regulatedgrowth such as the bHLH proteins HFR1 and PAR1 [53,60–62]as well as some members of the BBX family of transcriptionalregulators [63].Collectively, these mechanisms tend to activate transcriptionfactors promoting elongation in shaded environments (e.g. PIFs)but also lead to the production of inhibitors of the process(e.g. HY5, HFR1) which are implicated in negative feedback loopsrequired for controlled growth regulation [3,61,62,64,65] .Phot NPH3RPT2PKSBendingCytosolCellwallAuxingradientPP++PIndirect effect

Molecular Mechanisms Controlling Neighbor Detectionand OutgrowthNeighbor detection is probably the simplest situation of lightquality regulating plant growth, because perception of the char-acteristic low R/FR ratio is primarily controlled by one photore-ceptor, phyB. Most of our current knowledge on related signalingmechanisms has been obtained by studying hypocotyl elonga-tion in lab conditions, where the low R/FR ratio is easily mimickedby adding supplemental far-red light to the control white lightsource. Under such conditions, conversion of phyB from theactive FR-absorbing Pfr to its inactive red-absorbing Pr formleads to stabilization of PIFs that are responsible for the rapidreprogramming of gene expression upon shade perception[48,66,67] . Although PIF4, PIF5 and PIF7 have partially overlap-ping roles, PIF7 plays a predominant function in neighbor detec-tion in seedlings [48,68] . The same PIFs also control adult
responses to low R/FR ratios, such as petiole elongation. How-ever, which PIF dominates those responses is less clear[69,70] . PIFs regulate expression of numerous genes, includingother transcription factors and negative regulators, resulting ina complex signaling network [3,71] .A major mechanism by which PIFs modulate growth is control-ling auxin biosynthesis and signaling [66]. In seedlings, a lowR/FR ratio is primarily sensed in cotyledons, where it leads toPIF-mediated auxin production followed by transport to thehypocotyl [72] (Figure 3 A). Increased auxin synthesis requiresenzymes of the TAA1-YUC pathway ( Box 1 )[73,74] . Fourof the eleven YUCs (YUC2 ,YUC5 ,YUC8 andYUC9 ) are inducedupon low R/FR treatment in a PIF-dependent manner [48,66,67] .The importance of this regulatory step is highlighted by theabsence of a low R/FR response in a yuc2yuc5yuc8yuc9 mutant[67,75] . Comparable mechanisms are likely to be involved in
adult plants, where both PIFs and auxin synthesis are requiredfor neighbor proximity-induced petiole elongation [70,76,77] .Blocking auxin transport with chemical inhibitors also abolisheslow R/FR-induced elongation, underlining the importance of aproper auxin distribution for this response [70,73,78,79] . Auxinis directed to the hypocotyl through PIN-dependent polar auxintransport and distributed to the different cell layers [78]whereit induces cell elongation. Three PIN-coding genes are inducedupon low R/FR treatment and the corresponding pin3pin4pin7mutant does not elongate under shade-mimicking conditions[67,78] . Regulation of apolar ABCB efﬂux carriers is also involvedin auxin basipetal transport in the hypocotyl in shade, which mayfacilitate PIN function [80].However, cotyledon-produced auxin does not fully explain hy-pocotyl elongation in neighbor detection, and organ-speciﬁcanalyses have been key to understanding the role of local re-
sponses [67,72,81,82] . Shade-marker genes, such as PIL1,HFR1 orATHB2 , are still induced in the hypocotyl of decapitatedBrassica rapa seedlings [72]. Because homologous genes inArabidopsis are direct PIF targets [62,66] , this observation sug-gests that PIFs play speciﬁc roles in the hypocotyl. Accordingly,comparison of transcriptomic analysis of cotyledons versus hy-pocotyl in low R/FR with ChIP-seq data reveals that PIFs targetmany early low R/FR-induced genes in both organs [67]. A largeproportion of auxin-regulated genes are induced simultaneouslyin cotyledons and hypocotyl, and some are even expressed ﬁrstin the hypocotyl. Furthermore, some auxin-responsive genes,such as SAUR22 , are still induced in the hypocotyl of mutantsdeﬁcient in auxin biosynthesis or transport [67]. Finally, localauxin inactivation in the hypocotyl also participates in the regu-
lation of elongation, independently of cotyledon-derived auxin[83]. Altogether, these observations illustrate that the neighbordetection response also depends on local hypocotyl signals(Figure 3 A).
detection response also depends on local hypocotyl signals(Figure 3 A).Once in the hypocotyl, lateral distribution of auxin to thedifferent cell layers is mediated at least by PIN3 [78]. However,how each hypocotyl tissue responds to auxin is poorly under-stood.

Neighbor proximity-inducedhypocotyl elongation and phototropismdependent on the PIF-auxin regulon.(A) Neighbor proximity-induced hypocotyl elon-gation results from a combination of signalingmechanisms in both cotyledons and hypocotyl. Inthe cotyledons, stabilization of PIFs in low R/FR
the cotyledons, stabilization of PIFs in low R/FRleads to speciﬁc responses, which include the in-duction of auxin biosynthetic genes from theYUCCA family. Auxin is transported to the hypo-cotyl via polar auxin transport and distributedlaterally to the different cell layers, where it hasspeciﬁc functions. Cotyledon-derived auxin drivescell elongation in the hypocotyl, partly throughactivation of the brassinosteroid pathway. In par-allel, PIFs activate local responses in the hypocotylwhich are necessary for low R/FR-induced elon-gation. Local metabolism also regulates auxinavailability to prevent excessive growth.

dominant-negative form of the transcriptional repressor IAA17/AXR3 ( Box 1 ) in a tissue-speciﬁc manner leads to defects inhypocotyl elongation in all tested lines with particularly strongeffects upon epidermal expression [84]. Auxin signaling is thusneeded in all hypocotyl cell layers, and the prominent role ofthe epidermis favors the idea that external cell layers limit stemelongation [85].Among other growth-related hormones, brassinosteroids arerequired for hypocotyl and petiole elongation in low R/FR andother shade-mimicking conditions [76,84,86] and brassinoste-roid-related gene ontology terms are signiﬁcantly detectedamong genes up-regulated in shade [65,67,76,77,81] . Neverthe-less, no signiﬁcant increase in brassinosteroid levels is observedin seedlings upon low R/FR treatment [87]. Interestingly BZR1,the main transcription factor regulating gene expression down-stream of brassinosteroid perception, interacts with PIF4 and
the auxin-responsive ARF6 to regulate common target genes[88]. A high proportion of low R/FR-induced genes identiﬁed asPIF4 or PIF5 targets are also bound by ARF6 and BZR1, whichsuggests that transcription factors of different hormonal path-ways work together in controlling gene expression in neighborproximity-mimicking conditions [67]. Accordingly auxin-medi-ated hypocotyl growth in neighbor detection occurs partiallythrough the control of the brassinosteroid pathway [84] (Fig-ure 3 A). Gibberellic acid is also required for low R/FR-inducedelongation, but contrary to BR, slightly higher gibberellic acidlevels have been measured at late time-points in response toplant proximity [87]. DELLA transcriptional repressors aredegraded in a gibberellic acid-dependent manner under lowR/FR [89], which releases PIFs from DELLA inhibition [90,91] .An additional level of regulation involves BBX24, a positive regu-lator of shade responses, whose interaction with DELLAs favors
PIF4 activity [92]. Finally, recent analysis of an ethylene-insensi-tive mutant suggests that this hormone is not essential for shade-induced hypocotyl elongation [81] and may be importantspeciﬁcally for petiole elongation where increased ethylenelevels were measured upon low R/FR treatment [79].Integrating Complex Light Information to ModulateGrowthIn natural environments, light signals are complex and activateseveral photoperception pathways at the same time. More andmore studies focus on such photosensory crosstalk to under-stand how plants integrate multifaceted information from theirenvironment and what the ﬁnal growth output is.Shade avoidance responses are modulated by PIF-dependentnegative feedback loops but also by other photosensory mech-anisms. When not yet ﬁltered by a canopy, strong UV-B signalsinhibit neighbor proximity-induced hypocotyl and petiole elonga-tion but also leaf hyponasty through UVR8 activity [93,94] . Like
other UVR8-dependent mechanisms, this repression reliespartially on HY5-driven gene induction through inhibition ofCOP1 activity [21,93] . The COP1/SPA complex is indeedrequired for shade avoidance responses, as shown by theweak low R/FR-induced elongation phenotypes of cop1 andspamutants [95,96] . Besides combined low R/FR + UV-B treat-ment triggers the degradation of PIF4 and PIF5 proteins, but howUVR8 controls PIFs stability remains unknown [93]. Phyto-chrome A also negatively controls hypocotyl elongation underprolonged low R/FR conditions through late-induced expressionofHY5 [65]. The impact of phyA is particularly strong when thelow R/FR ratio is perceived early in development, right aftergermination [97,98] . In such a case, shade avoidance occurs atthe same time as de-etiolation, a developmental processenabling plants to become photoautotrophic. De-etiolation com-prises inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and promotion of coty-
ledon expansion, processes which are reversed to some extentduring shade avoidance [99]. PhyA is the sole photoreceptor trig-
prises inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and promotion of coty-ledon expansion, processes which are reversed to some extentduring shade avoidance [99]. PhyA is the sole photoreceptor trig-gering de-etiolation under FR light and is thus essential for seed-ling establishment and survival in deep canopy shade, on theother hand it antagonizes phyB-controlled shade avoidance.Under dense vegetation, depletion of blue and red wave-lengths is added to increased far-red transmission, which affectsboth photosynthetic activity and light signaling. Although there isno evidence for a natural situation in which only blue light wouldbe reduced, studies using blue-depleted light have allowed dis-entangling the confounding effects of low blue and low R/FR intrue shade conditions. A drastic reduction in blue light intensityas experienced by plants under a canopy induces typical shadeavoidance phenotypes in both seedlings [50,79,86] and adult
plants [69,79,100] . Although low blue and low R/FR show distincttranscriptional patterns and induce different hypocotyl growthkinetics, the long-term phenotypic responses are quite compa-rable [50,69] . Phenotypic analyses of cryptochrome-deﬁcientmutants indicate that these photoreceptors function as negativeregulators of low blue-dependent shade responses and preventexcessive elongation [69,79,100] . Genetic and biochemical evi-dence suggests that cry1 and cry2 act at least partially upstreamof PIF transcription factors in the regulation of low blue-inducedhypocotyl elongation [50]. However, how the interaction be-tween crys and PIFs is differentially regulated under low blueand in canopy shade conditions and how this affects PIF activityremains poorly understood. Interestingly, low blue enhances theeffect of low R/FR, leading to growth and transcriptional re-sponses that are very similar to plants grown under true canopy
shade [69]. One mechanism underlying this combined photore-ceptor action is the reduction of low R/FR-induced negativefeedback loops by low blue [69]. This represents a good exampleof how complex natural light environments can be simulated inlaboratory conditions and how this leads to mechanistic insightsinto photoreceptor crosstalk.A similar approach comparing natural and artiﬁcial light com-binations was recently used to study the crosstalk between phy-tochromes and phototropins during the control of phototropismin green seedlings [19]. In neighbor detection conditions, photo-tropic bending is enhanced gradually with the decrease of theR/FR ratio. The response is negatively regulated by phyB andthe cryptochromes while the PIF-YUC regulon is also requiredfor this asymmetric growth response [19]. Importantly, increasein hypocotyl curvature under low R/FR does not simply correlatewith the growth potential. This suggests that plants in a shaded
environment can reorient their growth more efﬁciently towards amore favorable light and that co-action between phytochromeinhibition and phototropin signaling helps plants to optimize lightcapture ( Figure 3 B). Cryptochromes also participate in themodulation of phototropism by shade and might be especiallyimportant under canopy shade where blue light is greatlyreduced [19]. Phytochrome–phototropin cooperation is alsoR936 Current Biology 27, R931–R940, September 11, 2017Current BiologyReview
essential in cryptogams like mosses and ferns to regulatebending towards unidirectional red light. This phenomenon de-pends on direct interaction of phytochromes and phototropinsat the plasma membrane in Physcomitrella patens [101] or ona phytochrome–phototropin chimeric photoreceptor, or neo-chrome, in some polypodiaceous fern species [102–104] . Neo-chromes may favor sensitivity for light perception, a crucial assetfor plants growing in dim light environments.Blue light-dependent phototropism has been mostly studied inseedlings seeing light for the ﬁrst time. Interestingly, as observedin green seedlings, phototropism in de-etiolating seedlings isalso controlled by a phytochrome–phototropin co-action. Never-theless the mechanisms are distinct as in de-etiolating seedlingsphyA promotes phototropism while as described before phyB in-hibits the process in green seedlings [29]. However, as outlinedbelow, in both cases phytochromes regulate the process by con-
trolling the expression of distinct elements in phototropinsignaling. Constitutive expression of a nuclear phyA leads to afaster phototropic response, suggesting that nuclear localizationof phyA is required for its action on phototropism [105] . Light-induced translocation of phyA into the nucleus (by red light) priorto directional blue light illumination is likely to favor phyA-depen-dent induction of phototropism signaling components like PKS1andRPT2 [29,105] . The other phytochromes do not seem to bemuch involved in the regulation of phototropism in de-etiolatingseedlings, as shown by the normal blue light-induced bending ofArabidopsis mutant seedlings lacking phyB-phyE [106] . Crypto-chromes are also important for a proper phototropic bendingresponse in etiolated seedlings and might act together withboth phototropins and phytochromes [19,29,107–109] . Cry1
and cry2 redundantly enhance phototropism at low ﬂuence,perhaps by modulating blue light-regulated growth [107,108] .As for phyA-mediated phototropic enhancement this has beenlinked to the control of RPT2 expression [109] . Finally, etiolatedhypocotyls also bend towards UV-B light, a response whichdepends on both phototropins and UVR8 [23]. Indeed a phot1-phot2 double mutant is able to bend towards monochromaticUV-B, yet at a slower rate than wild type seedlings, suggestingthat phot1 and phot2 are important for the early phase of direc-tional growth towards UV-B [23,110] . Interestingly, UVR8-dependent bending requires HY5, which accumulates at the litside of the hypocotyl upon directional UV-B perception [111] .The underlying mechanism may involve a gradient of HY5 activitynegatively regulating cell elongation from the illuminated to theshaded side of the organ. How UV-B modulates phototropismin green seedlings and how this pertains to growth modulation
in a complex canopy remains an interesting question for thefuture.ConclusionsOver the past decades, much has been learned about individualsignaling pathways by using simpliﬁed light environments thatare primarily sensed by a single photoreceptor, such as the con-trol of neighbor perception by phyB. Much remains to be under-stood about shade responses at the tissue and cellular levels.However, the current information now enables the communityto study more realistic light conditions to investigate the mecha-nisms underlying the integration of signals emanating fromseveral light sensors [19,69,93] . The next challenge will be totest hypotheses generated in controlled environments in muchmore variable natural conditions. Interestingly, outdoor experi-ments aimed at determining the inﬂuence of various pathwayscontrolling the timing of reproduction in Arabidopsis yieldedquite some surprises [112] . It is likely that novel discoveries will
also result from the application of such approaches to the study
controlling the timing of reproduction in Arabidopsis yieldedquite some surprises [112] . It is likely that novel discoveries willalso result from the application of such approaches to the studyof shade avoidance and phototropism. For example, soil re-sources and pathogen load both have an inﬂuence on plantcompetition and canopy formation, and hence it will be inter-esting to study the integration of light cues with other importantvariables [113,114] . Such studies are likely to provide mecha-nistic insight into complex signaling integration that is of interestto understand plant growth at the individual level but also howthese factors inﬂuence community composition [113–115] .I norder to reach this level of understanding, it will be importantto compare and contrast ecotypes and species with different re-sponses to shade cues.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe apologize to colleagues whose work could not be cited due to space lim-
