induced skin alterations. A dietary approach based of these compounds could be a safe and effective methodto provide a continuous adjunctive photoprotection measure. In a previous study, a combination of rosemary(Rosmarinus officinalis ) and grapefruit ( Citrus paradisi ) extracts has exhibited potential photoprotectiveeffects both in skin cell model and in a human pilot trial.Objective : We investigated the efficacy of a combination of rosemary ( R. officinalis ) and grapefruit(C. paradisi ) in decreasing the individual susceptibility to UVR exposure (redness and lipoperoxides) andin improving skin wrinkledness and elasticity.Design : A randomised, parallel group study was carried out on 90 subjects. Furthermore, a pilot, randomised,crossover study was carried out on five subjects. Female subjects having skin phototype from I to III andshowing mild to moderate chrono- or photoageing clinical signs were enrolled in both studies. Skin redness
(a* value of CIELab colour space) after UVB exposure to 1 minimal erythemal dose (MED) was assessed inthe pilot study, while MED, lipoperoxides (malondialdehyde) skin content, wrinkle depth (image analysis),and skin elasticity (suction and elongation method) were measured in the main study.Results : Treated subjects showed a decrease of the UVB- and UV A-induced skin alterations (decreased skinredness and lipoperoxides) and an improvement of skin wrinkledness and elasticity. No differences werefound between the 100 and 250 mg extracts doses, indicating a plateau effect starting from 100 mg extractsdose. Some of the positive effects were noted as short as 2 weeks of product consumption.Conclusions : The long-term oral intake of NutroxsunTMcan be considered to be a complementary nutritionstrategy to avoid the negative effects of sun exposure. The putative mechanism for these effects is most likely
to take place through the inhibition of UVR-induced reactive oxygen species and the concomitantinflammatory markers (lipoperoxides and cytokines) together with their direct action on intracellularsignalling pathways.Keywords: plants extracts ; Rosmarinus ofﬁcinalis; Citrus paradisi; clinical study ;photoprotection ;antiageingReceived: 18 April 2016; Revised: 4 June 2016; Accepted: 4 June 2016; Published: 1 July 2016Exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) isone of the most important environmental factorsaffecting skin physiology. Solar UVR reaching theearth’s surface can be classified according to wavelengthas UVB (290 /C1320 nm) and UV A (320 /C1380 nm) radiation.UV A and UVB radiation ratio reaching earth’s surfaceis 95%:5%, and it is dependent on geo-orbital factors(latitude, season, time) and on environmental factors(ozone layer, cloud thickness, pollutants, UV rays reflec-tion from ground) (1, 2).Historically, UVB radiation has been considered re-
sponsible for early and late consequences of solar UVRexposure. UVB radiation is, in fact, the main cause of thecardinal sign of acute solar UVR exposure: the erythemasign characterising the inflammatory reaction typical ofsunburn (3 /C17). Erythema starts approximately 3 /C15 h afterUVB radiation exposure, reaches its maximum at 12 /C124 h,

Erythema starts approximately 3 /C15 h afterUVB radiation exposure, reaches its maximum at 12 /C124 h,and fades over 72 h (8). Skin inflammation due to acuteexposure to UVR has been shown to be characterised bythe release of neuropeptides, histamine, prostaglandins,researchfood & nutrition/C230Food & Nutrition Research 2016. #2016 Vincenzo Nobile et al.

serotonin, and oxygen radicals (4 /C16, 9, 10), and theupregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such asinterleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumournecrosis factor alpha (TNF- a) (11/C116). Histologically,sunburn is characterised by dyskeratotic and vacuolatedkeratinocytes (sunburn cells), mild epidermal spongiosis,depletion of Langerhans cells, dermal oedema, endothe-lial cell enlargement, and later by a neutrophilic dermalinfiltrate (17). Accumulated evidence on the effects ofprolonged or repetitive UVB exposure during the past twodecades has been reported to lead to generalised immu-nosuppression leading to carcinogenesis (18, 19) throughthe production/secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokinessuch as IL-4 and IL-10 (11, 20, 21).In recent years, an increasing use of artificial sources ofUV A radiation both for medical treatment (phototherapyand photochemotherapy) and for aesthetic purposes(solarium) has revealed the harmful role of UV A radiation
in the pathophysiology of skin alterations due to sunexposure. UV A radiation penetrates deeper within the skinand is mostly responsible for the generation of reactiveoxygen species (ROS) including singlet oxygen (1O2), andother non-radical and radical ROS, such as hydrogenperoxide (H2O2) and the superoxide radical (O 2/C147/C28) (22/C126)and, to a lesser extent than UVB radiation, can also induceDNA damage (27, 28). UV A-induced oxidative stressincreases the potential for reactions like the oxidation oflipids and proteins (29). Both UV A and UVB contributesignificantly to photoageing.The protection of the skin from solar exposure isconsigned to topical sunscreens. However, topical sunsc-reens have drawbacks including seasonal application(generally sunscreens are applied only during holidays)and inadequate application methods (e.g. quantity andspreading). Furthermore, the sun protection factor (SPF)provided by sunscreens seems to be overestimated, under
testing conditions, when compared to the real-life condi-tion of use (30, 31). Therefore, a dietary approach tophotoprotection could be an effective method to provide acontinuous adjunctive protection measure, with population-level impact (32).Several plant extracts have been found to be effectivein preventing UV-induced skin alterations. The mostimportant group of compounds includes phenolic acid,flavonoids, and high-molecular-weight polyphenols(33/C139). Several studies have shown the flavonoids to actas scavengers of superoxide anions, singlet oxygen, hydro-xyl radicals, and lipid peroxyl radicals (37, 40 /C143). Thereare also reports of flavonoids inhibiting the activities ofmany enzymes, including lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase,monooxygenase, xanthine oxidase, mitochondrial succi-nate dehydrogenase, NADH oxidase, phospholipase A2,protein kinases, and nuclear transcription factor (NF- kB)(44, 45).A previous study demonstrated the efficacy of a com-
mercially available mixture of citrus and rosemary extracts(NutroxsunTM, Nutrafur S.A. & Monteloeder S.L., Spain)in skin cell models and on humans. The following wasreported: 1) a protective effect on cells viability after UVBradiation, a decrease of UVB-induced intracellular ROS,and prevention of DNA damage in an immortalisedhuman keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT), 2) a decreasedchromosomal aberrations in X-irradiated human lympho-cytes, and 3) an increase of the minimal erythemal dose(MED) 8 and 12 weeks after the oral daily consumption(250 mg) of the extracts (46). Based on these preliminarydata, in the current study we investigated the efficacy of thetested product (100 and 250 mg doses) in decreasing theindividual susceptibility to UVR exposure (redness andlipoperoxides [LPO]), in decreasing wrinkle depth, and inimproving skin elasticity. To our knowledge, no otherstudies have investigated the photoprotective and antiage-ing efficacy of the tested product.Methods

studies have investigated the photoprotective and antiage-ing efficacy of the tested product.MethodsStudy designThis was a monocentric, randomised, crossover (short-term study), parallel group (long-term study) study con-ducted in Italy. The study protocol and the informedconsent form were approved by the ‘Independent EthicalCommittee for Non-Pharmacological Clinical trials’ dur-ing its meeting on 15 December 2014. All subjects providedwritten informed consent before initiation of any study-related procedures. No changes to treatment regimen orto methods were necessary after study starting.SubjectsEligible subjects were all adult, female subject, having skinphototype from I to III (Fitzpatrick classification) (47)and showing mild to moderate chrono- or photoageingclinical signs. The subjects were of general good health,had no alimentary/eating disorders (i.e. bulimia, psycho-genic eating disorders, etc.), and have known history
of metabolic syndrome. Exclusion criteria were pregnancyor intention to become pregnant, lactation, food into-lerances/allergy, pharmacological treatments known tointerfere with the test product or having an effect onmetabolism, participation in another similar study, un-willingness or inability to comply with the requirements ofthe study protocol. The study further excluded subjectsusing food supplements containing active ingredients thathave an influence on skin response to UV rays or on skinageing. During all the study period, subjects were asked toavoid any UV exposure (artificial UV light or sunlight).The study took place at Farcoderm Srl facilities in SanMartino Siccomario (PV), Italy.

safety and efficacy assessment of cosmetics, food supple-ments and medical devices.InterventionThe test product was a commercially available mixtureof rosemary and citrus extracts (NutroxsunTM, suppliedby Monteloeder S.L., Miguel Servet 16, Elche, Alicante,Spain), obtained from dried rosemary ( Rosmarinusofficinalis ) leaves and grapefruits ( Citrus paradisi ), re-spectively. NutroxsunTMtotal phenolic standard contentis higher than 35 gallic acid equivalents/100 g dry weight(dw) as determined by Folin assay (48), being the totalrosemary phenolic content higher than 7% dw and totalgrapefruit flavones content higher than 20% dw.Both in the long-term and in the short-term tests,subjects were randomly assigned to receive 100 mgNutroxsunTM, 250 mg NutroxsunTM, or the placebo(100% maltodextrin) product. In the short-term study,subjects received the first dose (100 or 250 mg) of the testproduct or the placebo product 15 /C130 min before UVB
exposure to 1 MED. Two supplementary doses weregiven 24 and 48 h after UV exposure (Fig. 1). In thelong-term study, subjects received 100 mg NutroxsunTM,250 mg NutroxsunTM, or the placebo product once a day atbreakfast.Primary and secondary outcomesThe primary endpoints with respect to the photoprotec-tive efficacy were the measurement of the UVB-inducedskin redness, the assessment of the erythemal responseof the skin after UVB exposure (290 /C1320 nm), and the mea-surement of the basal and UV A-stimulated (320 /C1400 nm)Fig. 1. Study ﬂow and schedule of assessments chart. Subjects were ﬁrst screened in the Farcoderm volunteers database(keywords: Sex /C30‘female’, Age /C30‘18’, Skin phototype /C30‘IBphototype BIII’, Skin type: ‘ageing or photoageing’, Testingpreferences: ‘food supplements’). Eligible participants were then screened by a board certiﬁed dermatologist. During the
screening visit, a physical examination was carried out in order to assess the uniformity of the test area (back) and the clinicalsign of skin ageing on the face. Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria were then enrolled and randomised to participate in theshort- or in the long-term study.

skin LPO content. The primary endpoint with respectto the antiageing efficacy was the measurement of thewrinkle depth. Skin elasticity was measured as a second-ary efficacy endpoint. The study flow and the schedule ofassessments chart are reported in Fig. 1.Measurement of skin rednessA spectrophotometer/colorimeter CM-700D (KonicaMinolta, Milano, Italy) was used to measure skin rednessin the CIELab colour space. The a* (red-green) para-meter was measured in the UVB-exposed skin site to1 MED. Measurements were taken excluding the specularreflection. The specular component excluded mode,provides results similar to those observed visually.Assessment of minimal erythemal doseOne day before the study began, a provisional MED wasdetermined in order to centre the UV doses ranges forthe MED assessment through the study. A series of UVBdoses (geometric progression of 1.25 /C29), were applied on
six small subsites (Fig. 2) of the skin of the back. MEDwas then assessed, under blind conditions, 20 94 h afterUV exposure. MED assessment was carried out in a roomwith matt neutral wall colour and sufficient illuminationconditions (at least 450 lux). MED assessment was con-sidered invalid when: 1) the series of UVB exposures ona subject failed to elicit an erythemal response on anysub-site, 2) all subsites in the exposure series showed anerythemal response, and 3) erythemal responses within anexposure series were randomly absent. The source of UVBradiation was a Multiport 601 /C1300 W Solar simulator(Solar†Light Co. Inc., Philadelphia, USA) compliantwith ISO 24444:2010 standard requirements (49). UVBdose was adjusted with a model PMA 2100 radiometer(Solar†Light Co. Inc., Philadelphia, USA) equippedwith a PMA 2103 LLG SUV detector (Solar†Light Co.Inc., Philadelphia, USA). Both the solar simulator and theradiometers were calibrated externally.Assessment of LPO
Assessment of LPOBasal and UV A-induced (10 J/cm2) skin LPO weremeasured in the 10th skin layer obtained using the skinstripping technique. Skin stripping was performed in theback (Fig. 2) using Corneofix†foils (Courage /C27KhazakaElectronic, Ko ¨ln, Germany) under standard pressureconditions (225 g/cm2). The first stripping was discardedwhile strip no. 11 was collected and stored at /C28808C untilfurther analysis. Malondialdehyde (MDA) was measuredaccording to the assay described by Erdelmeier et al.in 1998 (50) with minor modification, as follows: 1) skinstrippings were layered in 12 multiwell plates containing500ml of a 0.5 mM CuSO4aqueous solution, 2) multiwellplates were incubated at 37 8C, using a microplate incu-bator/shaker under continuous agitation for 1 h, 3) afterincubation 1.3 ml R1 solution (2.13 mg N-methyl-2-phenylindole/ml acetonitrile) and 0.3 ml 37% HCl wasadded and samples were further incubated at 45 8Cf o r
60 min under continuous agitation, 4) the reaction wasstopped in ice for 10 min followed by 10 min at roomtemperature, 5) 1 ml of solution was centrifuged at 13,000rpm per 10 min, and 6) absorbance was read at 586 nmusing a multiwell plates reader (programmable MPTreader model DV 990BV6; Gio DeVita & C, Rome, Italy).Fig. 2.

The source of UV A radiation was a Multiport 601 /C1300 WSolar simulator (Solar†Light Co. Inc., Philadelphia,USA) compliant with the Japan Cosmetic IndustryAssociation (JCIA) measurement standard for UV Aprotection (51) and ISO 24442:2011 standard require-ments (52) (Table 1). UV A dose was adjusted with a modelPMA 2100 radiometer (Solar†Light Co. Inc., Philadel-phia, USA) equipped with a PMA 2113 LLG UV Adetector (Solar†Light Co. Inc., Philadelphia, USA).Both the solar simulator and the radiometers werecalibrated and compliant to ISO 24444:2010 standard.Wrinkle depth
Wrinkle depthWrinkles depth was measured using a three-dimensional(3-D) microtopography imaging system (PRIMOS 3D lite,GFMesstechnik GmbH, Teltow, Germany). The imagingsystem projects structured light on a specific surface ofthe skin with a digital micro-mirror device (DMD, TexasInstruments, Irving, TX, USA) and records the image witha CCD camera. Skin surface microtopography is thenreconstructed using temporal phase shift algorithmsto generate 3-D images. The imaging system has anoverlap feature which enables precise matching of photostaken at different visits. In order to improve image overlap,subjects’ position was regulated using a stereotactic device(Canfield Scientific, Inc., Fairfield, NJ, USA). Wrinkledepth was measured in the periocular area (‘crow’s feetwrinkles’) using the appropriate software routine.Skin elasticityA skin viscoelasticity analyser (Cutometer†MPA 580,Courage /C27Khazaka Electronic, Ko ¨ln, Germany) was used
to measure skin elasticity. The skin surface of the face(cheek) was drawn into the aperture (3 mm) of the probeby a negative pressure (450 mbar) for 3 sec and thereafterreleased for 3 sec. The penetration depth of the skin insidethe probe, during the suction and the release phase, wasmeasured by a non-contact optical measuring system.Two skin elasticity indices were measured: 1) R2 (Ua/Uf,gross elasticity or overall elasticity, Fig. 3a represents theability of redeformation of the skin to its basal state, and2) R5 (Ur/Ue, net elasticity, Fig. 3b represents the elasticrecovery of the skin deformation to its basal state due to itselastic component.Sample sizeSample size was calculated, for the long-term study, with atwo-sided 5% significance level and a power of 80% taking
into account a 20% variation of the primary endpointsdue to both inter-individual human variability and errorin the measurement techniques. Sample size was calcu-lated using PASS 11 statistical software (version 11.0.8 forWindows) running on Windows Server 2008 R2 StandardSP1 64 bit edition (Microsoft, USA). A sample size of20 subjects per group was necessary given an anticipateddropout rate of 20%.RandomisationA restricted randomisation list was created using PASS11 (version 11.0.8; PASS, LLC. Kaysville, UT, USA)statistical software running on Windows Server 2008 R2Standard SP1 64 bit edition (Microsoft, USA) by abiostatistician and stored in a safe place. Randomisation
sequence was stratified using 10% maximum allowable %deviation with a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. The allocationsequence was concealed from the study director insequentially numbered, opaque, and sealed envelopes,reporting the unblinded treatment allocation (based onsubject entry number in the study). The A4 sheet reportingthe unblinded treatment was folded to render the envelopeimpermeable to intense light. After acceptance of thesubject in the study the appropriate numbered envelopewas opened. An independent technician dispensed eitheractive or placebo products according to the card insidethe envelope. The study adhered to established proceduresto maintain separation between the investigator and itscollaborators and the staff that delivered the intervention.Investigator and its collaborators who obtained outcomemeasurements were not informed on the product group
measurements were not informed on the product groupassignment. Staff who delivered the intervention did nottake outcome measurements. Subjects, investigator andcollaborators were kept masked to products assignment.The active and the placebo products were in capsule formand identical in appearance. They were prepacked inFig. 3.

Each subjectwas assigned an order number and received the capsules inthe corresponding prepacked blister.Statistical methodsStatistical analysis was performed using NCSS 8 (version8.0.4 for Windows; NCSS, Kaysville, UT, USA) runningon Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard SP1 64 bitedition (Microsoft, USA). Data normality was checkedusing Shapiro /C1Wilk W normality test and data shape.Intragroup (vs. baseline) statistical analysis was carriedout using repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOV A) followed by Tukey /C1Kramer post-test. Inter-group (between treatments) statistical analysis was carriedout using multivariate analysis of variance (M-ANOV A)followed by two-way t test of Student. A pB0.05 wasconsidered statistically significant. Statistical analysis out-put was reported as follows: * pB0.05, ** pB0.01, and***pB0.001.ResultsSubjects
***pB0.001.ResultsSubjectsThe study was conducted between February and April2015. A total of 90 female subjects were successfullyrandomised (Fig. 4) in the long-term study while a totalof five female subjects were enrolled in the short-termstudy. The population was Caucasian. Demographicand baseline characteristics (Table 2) were similar acrosstreatment arms, indicating an unbiased randomisationand the absence of covariates. Subjects participating in theshort-term pilot study attended clinic visits at the time ofrandomisation (baseline) and 24, 48 and 72 h after UVBexposure and the first product intake; while remainedat our clinical facilities where the measure was done 1 and4 h the day after UVB exposure. In the long-term study,subjects attended clinic visits at the time of randomisation(baseline) and after 14 days, 1, and 2 months of productuse. Data analysis was intention-to-treat and involvedall subjects who were randomly assigned. Subjects’ com-
pliance to treatment was assessed by means of productaccountability, as follows: at each visit, the expectedamount of consumed capsule was compared with theamount dispensed minus the amount the subject returned.No major deviation was observed in the treatment regi-men. All subjects were included in the safety analysis dataset. All the tested products were well tolerated. No adversereactions occurred during the study period.Effect of the extracts on UVB-induced skin rednessTwenty-four hours after UVB exposure to 1 MED, skinredness was increased by 40.5% ( p/C300.0099) in the placebogroup, by 37.0% ( p/C300.0011) in the 100 mg dose group,and 39.6% ( p/C300.0006) in the 250 mg dose group (Fig. 5).The effect of UVB on skin redness was similar for alltreatments ( p/C300.9387). Skin redness time course (varia-tion vs. 24 h) exhibited a decrease compared to placeboas the extract dose was increased from 100 to 250 mg. Astatistical significant variation was observed at 48 h in the
100 mg dose group ( p/C300.0252), and at 25 h ( p/C300.0437)in the 250 mg dose group, compared to 24 h data point. At72 h for both the 100 and 250 mg dose groups skin rednessreturned to its basal (pre-UVB-exposure) value. In theplacebo-treated group, skin redness showed a significantdecrease at 72 h ( p/C300.0112), but even it remained slightlyhigher when compared to its basal value ( p/C300.0289).Fig. 4.

Despite the evident differences in time course behaviour ofskin redness between 100 and 250 mg dose groups, thisvariation was not statistically significant ( p/C300.3720) when100 and 250 mg data were compared (Fig. 6). The variationof skin redness observed for both 100 and 250 mg extractsdose treatment regimen was statistically significant whencompared to placebo treatment regimen (100 mg group,p/C300.020; 250 mg group, p/C300.0182).Effects on MEDA significant increase of the MED was observed forboth 100 and 250 mg dose groups (Fig. 7). MED increasedby 4.0 ( /C2715.2%), 5.2 ( /C2720.5%), and 7.7 ( /C2729.8%)mJ/cm2, after 0.5, 1, and 2 months treatment, respectively(p/C300.0000) in the 100 mg dose group. A similar efficacyprofile was seen for the 250 mg dose group, where MEDwas increased by 3.1 ( /C2711.7%), 5.5 ( /C2720.2%), and7.5 (/C2726.9%) mJ/cm2,a f t e r0 . 5 ,1 ,a n d2m o n t h st r e a t m e n t ,respectively ( p/C300.0007 at 0.5 months and p/C300.0000 at
1 and 2 months). Variation of MED was not statisticallysignificant ( p/C300.1857) when 100 mg and 250 mg data werecompared. MED variation observed for both 100 mgand 250 mg extract dose groups was statistically signifi-cant when compared to placebo group (100 mg group,p/C300.0001; 250 mg group, p/C300.0000). MED was un-changed ( p/C300.4049) in the placebo-treated subjects (Fig. 8).Horny layer lipoperoxides contentBasal lipid peroxidationA significant decrease of the basal, not UV A stimulated,LPO content was observed for both 100 and 250 mgdose groups (Table 3). Skin horny layer MDA contentwas decreased by 14.4, 18.5 and 18.7% after 0.5, 1, and 2months treatment, respectively ( p/C300.0000) in the 100 mgTable 1.

Skin horny layer MDAcontent 4 h after UV A exposure was decreased by 9.7, 16.2and 20.1% after 0.5, 1, and 2 months treatment, respec-tively ( p/C300.0000) in the 100 mg dose group while 24 h
after UV A exposure the MDA content was decreased by8.7, 13.4, and 15.1% after 0.5, 1, and 2 months treatment,respectively ( p/C300.0000). A similar efficacy profilewas seen for the 250 mg dose group, where MDA, 4 hafter UV A exposure, was decreased by 10.2, 16.4, and21.7% after 0.5, 1, and 2 months treatment, respectively(p/C300.0000); while 24 h after UV A exposure the MDAcontent was decreased by 9.1, 13.3, and 15.8% after0.5, 1, and 2 months treatment, respectively ( p/C300.0000).MDA variation observed for both 100 and 250 mg dosegroups was also statistically significant when comparedto placebo treatment (Table 3). MDA was unchanged(p/C300.7952 at 4 h, and p/C300.7384 at 24 h) in the placebo-treated subjects.Wrinkle depthA significant decrease of the wrinkle depth in the ‘crow’sfeet’ was observed for both 100 and 250 mg dose groups(Fig. 9). Wrinkle depth decrease was by 27.4 ( /C288.8%), 42.4(/C2813.4%), and 43.7 ( /C2814.8%) mm, in the 100 mg dose
group, after 0.5, 1, and 2 months treatment, respectively(p/C300.0000). A similar efficacy profile was seen for the250 mg extracts dose treatment regimen, where wrinkledepth was decreased by 22.7 ( /C289.1%), 31.5 ( /C2812.6%),and 35.9 ( /C2813.9%) mm, after 0.5, 1, and 2 monthstreatment, respectively ( p/C300.0001 at 0.5 months andp/C300.0000 at 1 and 2 months). Variation of wrinkle depthwas not statistically significant ( p/C300.7731) when 100and 250 mg data were compared. Wrinkle depth variationobserved for both 100 and 250 mg dose groups was stati-stically significant when compared to placebo treatment(p/C300.0000). Wrinkle depth was unchanged ( p/C300.9740)in the placebo-treated subjects throughout the study.Skin elasticity
Skin elasticityGross elasticity (R2 parameter)A significant increase of the skin gross elasticity (Fig. 3a)was observed for both 100 and 250 mg extracts dosetreatment regimen (Table 4). Skin elasticity increased by1.8, 3.2, and 4.6%, in the 100 mg dose group after 0.5, 1,and 2 months treatment, respectively ( p/C300.0026 at 0.5months and p/C300.0000 at 1 and 2 months). A similarefficacy profile was seen for the 250 mg dose group, whereskin elasticity was increased by 1.5, 2.9, and 3.7%, after 0.5,1, and 2 months treatment, respectively ( p/C300.0010 at 0.5months; p/C300.000 at 1 month and p/C300.002 at 2 months).Variation of skin elasticity was not statistically significant(p/C300.9253) when 100 and 250 mg were compared. Skinelasticity variation observed for both 100 and 250 mgdose groups was statistically significant when compared toplacebo group (100 mg group, p/C300.0455; 250 mg group,p/C300.0281). Skin elasticity was unchanged ( p/C300.1355) in
the placebo-treated subjects throughout the study.Net elasticity (R5 parameter)A significant increase of the skin net elasticity (Fig. 3b)was also observed for both 100 and 250 mg dose groups(Table 4). Skin elasticity increase was by 3.3, 5.8 and9.0%, in the 100 mg dose group after 0.5, 1, and 2 monthstreatment, respectively ( p/C300.0000). A similar efficacy
(Table 4). Skin elasticity increase was by 3.3, 5.8 and9.0%, in the 100 mg dose group after 0.5, 1, and 2 monthstreatment, respectively ( p/C300.0000). A similar efficacyprofile was seen for the 250 mg extracts dose treatmentregimen, where skin elasticity was increased by 2.9, 5.5,and 7.4%, after 0.5, 1, and 2 months treatments, respec-tively ( p/C300.0000). Variation of skin elasticity was notstatistically significant ( p/C300.2061) when compared 100 and250 mg data were compared each other. Skin elasticityvariation observed for both 100 and 250 mg extracts dosetreatment regimen was statistically significant when com-pared to placebo group ( p/C300.0000). Skin elasticity wasunchanged ( p/C300.2984) in the placebo-treated subjectsthroughout the study.DiscussionIn recent years, different extracts derived from plants havebeen investigated for therapeutic application due to theirpharmacological activity on inflammatory processes and
other physiopathological conditions. Dietary interventionsFig. 5. Skin redness time course after 1 MED UVBexposure.

can interfere with several cell-signalling pathways andmolecular targets may be involved in their efficacy inpreventing or treating altered physiopathological condi-tions (53). Many plants, herbs and spices typically usedfor food flavouring and nutrition are excellent sources ofphenolic compounds, which have been reported to showantioxidant activity. The anti-inflammatory activity ofnatural extracts has been associated to their antioxidantactivity, and to a specific role on nitric oxide (NO)production suppression (54 /C156).In a previous study, it was reported (46) the synergisticeffects of a mixture of rosemary and citrus extracts indecreasing the generation of UVB-induced intracellularROS and in preventing UVR-induced DNA damage inthe comet assay.

generation of radical species using ionising radiation.A pilot trial in humans also showed the preliminary effectof the combination in increasing MED. Therefore, ourpresent study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory,photoprotective, and antiageing effects of this combina-tion. Two doses of the combination (100 and 250 mg) wereinvestigated in order to assess if a dose-effect relationshipbetween the measured parameters and the product intakeexists.The in vivo anti-inflammatory effect of the extracts onUVB-induced skin inflammation was investigated in apilot (n/C305 subjects) crossover study. Both 100 and 250 mgcombination doses proved to be effective in decreasingthe skin redness induced by 1 MED UVB exposure. Asobserved in the skin redness time course curves, the grouphaving 250 mg dose of the combination recovered basallevel in a much faster manner than that of the 100 mgdose group, clearly revealing a dose-dependent anti-
inflammatory effect. The results also indicate the potentialeffect of the tested products in decreasing the UVB-inducedskin redness with only 2 days of product consumption;however the small sample size and the associated highstandard deviation was a limitation of the study andfurther studies would be required. Anyway, the resultsobtained in the pilot study provided the basis for samplesize calculation.In most studies on photoprotection based on nutritionalingredients, there is a time frame of approximately 6 /C110weeks until protection against erythema becomes signifi-cant (57). A time frame much longer than we have seen inthis study where the individual susceptibility to UVBradiation exposure (erythema) was decreased ( /C2715.2 and/C2711.7% for 100 and 250 mg dose group, respectively) after2 weeks of product use (Fig. 7). Two months after productuse, the lowest dose of UVB radiation to produce theerythematous reaction was increased by about 7 mJ/cm2,
2,corresponding to an increase around 33% of the time ofsun exposure without experiencing sunburn. A resultTable 3.

similar to that was obtained in a previous study wherevolunteers showed a 37% increase in the MED after 8weeks of product use (46).In the previous cell study using the same extractcombination, part of the protective effect of rosemaryand citrus polyphenols was assigned to their capacity ofabsorption/scattering of UVB radiation. However, thisfactor may have a negligible contribution in vivo due tothe low concentration of polyphenols’ metabolites inskin cells.The antioxidant properties of the skin metabolitesderived from the compounds of the extracts combinationmay have a significant contribution to the observed UVRprotective effects but further effects are expected to takeplace. The terpenes and caffeic acid derivatives fromrosemary and citrus flavanones and flavones of thecombination showed the capacity to scavenge first stageintracellular free radicals induced by UVR and ionisingradiations such as such as superoxide radical anions(O
2/C147/C28), H 2O2, and hydroxyl radicals (OH/C147) (46, 58, 59).Furtherly, some of these radicals generate second stagelipoperoxy radicals (R /C1OO/C147) which are responsible forthe generation of inflammatory mediators and generateDNA damage and protein oxidation. ROS are alsoconsidered inflammatory mediators through the activa-tion of the NF- kB signalling, which controls the expres-sion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, theclinically visible increase of MED and the decrease ofUVB-induced skin redness of the ingredient is not onlydue to their antioxidant capacity but also to their abilityto attenuate the subsequent inflammatory response.Moreover, it has been proven that some of thesecompounds are capable to reach intracellular targets andmodulate multiple metabolic processes that go beyondtheir antioxidant properties (60). Hence, the polyphenolsin the combination may be able to exert a direct modula-tion of the NF- kB signalling regardless their antioxidant
capacity. In fact, rosemary polyphenols were shownin vivo to reduce the expression of several inflammation-associated genes which are regulated by NF- kB such asIL-1b, TNF- a, COX-1 and COX-2 in a mouse inflamedskin model, (61). In a keratinocyte HaCaT cell modelstimulated with sodium lauryl sulphate, rosemary diter-penes also blocked the translocation of nuclear factorNF-kB by directly inhibiting its upstream signallingincluding (spleen tyrosine kinase) Syk/Src, phosphoinosi-tide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt) tyrosinekinases (62).Skin LPO basal content (Table 3) was decreasedindicating an effect of the extracts in improving the skinantioxidant status. Interestingly, the skin ability to coun-teract UV A-induced lipoperoxidation was also increasedstarting from 2 weeks of product use. Two months after
product use, the UV A-induced LPO content was decreasedby about 20 and 15%, 4 and 24 h after UV A exposure(Table 3). These results indicate that the metabolitesderived from the ingredient are able to decrease the levelof lipid peroxidation in the skin cells in only 2 weeks ofconsumption and therefore diminish the levels of skinLPO (lipoperoxy radicals, and MDA and hydroxynonenalas final products), which have been demonstrated toinduce DNA and protein oxidation (63). Since LPO arealso considered as inflammatory response mediators, theirdrop is also consistent with the observed decrease in skinredness after 2 weeks of product consumption.In the present study, an improvement of the wrinkledepth (Fig. 9) and skin elasticity (Table 4) was also ob-served starting from 2 weeks of product use. No differencesin the measured outcomes were found between 100 and250 mg extracts dose regimen, indicating a plateau effectstarting from the lowest dose.

starting from the lowest dose.This result reveals an improvement of the extracellularmatrix status that is composed of proteoglycans, poly-saccharides and proteins, which are responsible for skinelasticity and stiffness. UVR-induced ROS and inflamma-tory mediators have been shown to induce the activationof nuclear transcription complex AP-1, through intracel-lular kinases signalling activation (MAP kinases, p38and JNK), leading to metalloproteinases (MMPs) activa-tion and decreased expression of collagen and othermatrix proteins with the final consequence of reduceddermal matrix formation (64). Therefore, the combinedantioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the in vivoproduct metabolites together with their direct action onTable 4.

intracellular signalling pathways may be the responsiblefactors for the decreased signs of photoaged skin.As the study protocol was implemented for all ages,skin phototype from I to III (the most susceptible toUVR), chrono- and photoaged skin, study results can beextended to the general population. The female genderselection does not represent a limitation for study resultsextending to the general population since the molecular,cellular, and tissue-specific events leading to inflamma-tion, chrono- or photoageing are shared among genders.ConclusionsOur results confirm the previous in vitro andin vivo results(46) indicating a photoprotective and antiageing efficacyof a combination of two plants extracts obtained fromdried rosemary ( R. officinalis ) leaves and grapefruits(C. paradisi ). Long-term oral extract supplementation cancontribute to skin protection by maintaining a steady-statesystemic concentration of compounds capable of protect-
ing the skin cells from UVR-induced alteration. Positiveeffects such as reduced UVR-induced erythema, decreasedskin LPO, decreased wrinkle depth, and increased elasti-city are noted as short as 2 weeks of product consumption.The putative mechanism for these effects is most probablyto take place through the inhibition of UVR-induced ROSand the concomitant inflammatory markers (LPO andcytokines) together with their direct action on intracellularsignalling pathways which are responsible for extracellularmatrix degradation. In conclusion, the intake of Nutrox-sunTMcan be considered a complementary nutrition stra-tegy to avoid the negative effects of sun exposure andphotoageing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the firststudy demonstrating the antioxidant, photoprotective, andantiageing efficacy of this combination of plants extracts.AcknowledgementsThe authors thank all of the Farcoderm staff who contributed to
