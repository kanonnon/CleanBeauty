These radiat ions can cause a range of effects from simple tanning to highly malignant skin canc ers, if unprotected. Sunscreen lotions, clothing and shade structures provide protection fr om the deleterious effects of ultraviolet radiations. Alterations in the construction parameters of fabrics with appropriate light absorbers and suitable finishing methods can be employed as UV protection fabrics. This paper deals with the deleterious effects of  UV rays and protection against them through
textile materials.  Key words:   erythema, absorbers, cover factor, UV index, swelling   Introduction  An appropriate amount of sun bath promotes the ci rculation of blood, invigorates the metabolism and improves resistance to various pathogens. Penetration of  UVR into the top layer of the skin leads to damage in the lower layer and produces premat ure ageing of skin and other effects including roughening, blotches, sagging, wrinkles, squamous cells and basal cell cancer. Many people love sunbathing, thereby extending the long term risk to their health. Persons working in the open atmosphere are also prone to keratose, the precursor of skin cancer. Australia has high levels of solar UV radiation, mainly because of  its geographical position; New Zeal and, USA, Switzerland, Norway, Scotland, Britain and Scandinavian countri es also have high melanoma rates.   UV radiation
UV radiation  Unravelling the mysteries related to ultraviolet rays , their properties, and their effects on various living creatures has been a gradual process spanning to the dur ation of almost three centuries starting from the seventeenth century [1 – 6]. Terms such as  near UV ((290 – 400 nm), far UV (180 – 290 nm) and vacuum UV (below 180 nm) have been coined by physi cists based on the properties  of the radiation. The term UVA represents the region 320 – 400 nm, t he term UV B represents the region between UV C and UV A, i.e. 290 – 320 nm, and UVC region repr esents the region below 290 m . The order of potency has been decided as UVC > UVB > UVA >. T he proportion of the UV region is about 5 – 6 % of the total incident radiation, and the quantum ener gy of UVR is similar to the bond energies of organic molecules [1 - 3, 7 – 10].   UV exposure and human skin
UV exposure and human skin   Factors that affect solar UVR in clude cloud cover, the sun’s altit ude, geographical position, altitude, ozone layer, scattering in the atmosphere, environm ental and related conditions. Much research has been carried out to assess the impact of the UV ra ys on various living organisms, especially humans [10, 11 – 18] and the relationship between skin canc er and UV dosage is well correlated. Changes in leisure behaviour, which has led to more frequent sun exposure, are one of the major reasons for malignant cutaneous melanoma. Skin cells that rece ive sunlight absorb harmf ul UV radiation, and slough off to excrete harmful UV from the body. But the absorption of too much UVR leads to scars that can induce diseases like skin cancer. Excessi ve UV radiation leads to cell damage and causes

The reciprocal value of these cuticle radiation dos es is called erythema effectiveness whose maximum occurs at 308 nm. The total UVR dose reaching the ski n is an important factor in the occurrence of both erythema and skin cancer, although there is no proven link between erythema and skin cancer [15]. In terms of sensitivity to light and tendency to pigmentation, there are 6 basic types of skin that demand different levels of UV protection [9 , 10, 16, 19 – 22] as shown in Table 1.  Table 1.  Effect of UV rays on different types of skin  Skin type (Appearance unexposed) Critical dose mJ/cm2 Self protection time (min) Risk level I - White 15 – 30 5 - 10 Burns easily, has the highest risk of premature skin ageing and greatest risk of developing skin cancer

Very rarely burns, easily tan  The minimal erithemal dose (MED) is apparently c onsistent with a fair complexion, but shows variations among people of types III and IV. For prac tical purposes, the population could be classified into two main groups, sensitive and less sensitive individuals [22].  Solar UV index, UV protection f actor and solar protection factor   The effect of ultraviolet radiation on living biological organisms has been extensively studied, and various reporting methods such as UV index, UV pr otection factor (UPF) and solar protection factor
(SPF) have been adopted to create awareness among the gener al public of the deleterious effects of UV radiations [6, 15, 23 – 27]. At a given wavel ength, electromagnetic radiation may be reflected, absorbed or transmitted by any given object. If the re sponse of the system at each wavelength is a linear function of the dose, then t he response (R) by a broad spectrum is given [24] by the following formula: R = ∫∫2121),()(ttdtdt Iλλλλλσ  where I ( λ, t) is the irradiance at wavelength λ, t is time and σ (λ) is the cross-section for eliciting this response at wavelengths λ. The changes in the spectrum have been covered by including time as an argument of the irradiance function and as a variable of integration.  The UV index is designed to provide the public with  a numerical indication of the maximum potential solar UVR level during the day; the higher the num ber, the higher the solar UVR hazard [21]. The
global solar UV Index is a measure of the highest level of UVR every day, and the UVI is calculated using various input parameters such as the oz one level, potential cloud cover, water vapour and aerosols [28]. The UV index is reported as the maximum biologically effective solar average UVR (UVR eff) for the day, and is an average taken over either  10 or 30 minutes. The UVR is usually highest around midday but the temperature is often highest later in the afternoon. UVR index values are grouped into five exposure categories [21, 25, 27], fr om low to extreme with different colour codes.  Ultra-violet protection factor   The protection extended by the textile materials,  accessories and sun screen lotions are denoted by different terminologies known as UPF and SPF [7, 12, 14, 15, 21, 29]. Risk estimates of unprotected skin, protected skin and UPF are gi ven by the following formulae: risk unprotected = ∑ Sλ Aλ ∆λ risk protected = ∑ Sλ Aλ ∆λ Tλ
λ Aλ ∆λ risk protected = ∑ Sλ Aλ ∆λ Tλ UPF = risk unprotected / risk protected
AUTEX Research Journal, Vol. 7, No 1, March 2007 © AUTEX  http://www.autexrj.org/No1- 2007/0192.pdf  55where S λ is the source spectrum (Wm2 nm-1), Tλ is the transmittance, A λ is the action spectrum for measured response and ∆λ is the bandwidth in nm. Since the rela tive erythemal spectral effectiveness is higher in the UV B region compared to the UV  A region, the UPF values depend primarily on the transmission in the UV B region [3]. UV rays falli ng on textiles are partly reflected, absorbed and partly transmitted through the fibres & interstices, and the opt ical porosity of a fabric limits its potential to provide protection against UVR.  The solar protection factor (SPF) is defined as a quotient from a harmful dose without, and a harmful dose with, sun protection. This can be calc ulated from erythemal effectiveness (EW ( λ)), (P(λ)) and from the wavelength dependent transmission of the s un protection agent [12]. The difference between
the values of UPS and SPF arises mainly bec ause of the ‘hole effect’ in the fabrics.   Effect of UV radiation on textile materials  UV radiation is one of the major c auses of degradation of textile materi als, which is due to excitations in some parts of the polymer molecule and a gr adual loss of integrity, and depends on the nature of the fibres [8, 30 – 38]. Because of the very large surf ace volume ratio, textile materials are susceptible to influences from light and other environmental fa ctors. The penetration of UVR in nylon causes photo oxidation and results in decrease in elastici ty, tensile strength and a slight increase in the degree of crystallinity [33, 35]. In the absence of UV  filters, the loss in t ensile strength appears to be higher in the case of nylon (100% loss), follow ed by wool, cotton and polyester, with approximately 23%, 34% and 44% respectively after 30 days of  exposure [36]. Elevated temperature and UVB
radiation on cotton plants result in severe loss of bolls [38]. Natura lly-coloured cottons contain pigment ranges from light green to tan, brown and inherent l ong-term UV protection properties [61] with a UPF of 64 and 47, whereas normal cotton shows a UPF of 8.  UV absorbers   UV absorbers are organic or inorganic colourless co mpounds with strong absorption in the UV range of 290 – 360 nm [8, 12, 13, 20, 30, 36, 39 – 46]. UV  absorbers incorporated into the fibres convert electronic excitation energy into thermal energy, function as radical scavengers and ?singlet oxygen quenchers. The high-energy, short-wave UVR excites the UV absorber to a hi gher energy state; the energy absorbed may then be dissipated as longer-wave r adiation [13]. Alternately, isomerisation can occur and the UV absorber may then fragment into non-absorbing isomers. Sunscreen lotions contain UV absorbers that physically bl ock UVR [13, 48, 47]. The most  widely used UVB screens, 2-ethyl
hexyl-4-methoxy cinnamate with high RI, make a subst antial contribution to t he RI matching of skin, i.e. ‘refractive index matching’ [48]. An effect ive UV absorber must be able to absorb throughout the spectrum, to remain stable against UVR, and to dissipate the absorbed energy to avoid degradation or loss in colour [36].  Organic UV absorbers are mainly derivativ es of o-hydroxy benzophenones, o-hydroxy phenyl triazines, o-hydroxy phenyl hydrazines  [8, 13, 30]. The orthohydroxyl group is considered essential for absorption and to make the compound soluble in alkaline solution. Some of the substituted benzophenones penetrate into synthetic fibres much like disperse dyes [36]. Commonly-used UV absorbers are 2-hydroxy benzophenones, 2-hydro xy phenyl benzotriazoles, 2-hydroxy phenyl-S-triazines and chemicals such as benzoic acid este rs, and hindered amines [40]. The strong absorption
in the near UV of 2, 4 dihydroxy benzophenone is attributed to conjugating chelation between the
in the near UV of 2, 4 dihydroxy benzophenone is attributed to conjugating chelation between the orthohydroxyl and carbonyl groups. Organic pr oducts like benzotriazole, hydro benzophenone and phenyl triazine are primarily used for coating and padding processes in order to achieve broad protection against UV rays [12]. Suitable combi nations of UV absorbers and antioxidants can yield synergistic effects [42]. Benz ophenone derivatives have low energy levels, easy diffusibility and a low sublimation fastness. Orthohydroxy phenyl and di phenyl triazine derivativ es have an excellent sublimation fastness, and a self-dispersing formulat ion can be used in high temperature dyeing in pad-baths and also in print pastes [44].  UV absorbers incorporated into the spinning dope pr ior to the fibre extrusion and dye bath in bath dyeing improve the light fastness of certain pastel shades and the w eatherability of spun-dyed fibres
[36, 49]. UV absorbers to the ex tent of 0.6 – 2.5% are suffici ent enough to provide UVR protection fabrics [9]. The presence of UV absorbers in PET, ny lon, silk and wool prot ects the fibres against sunlight-induced photo degradation. On wool, UV absorbers can retard the photo-yellowing that
AUTEX Research Journal, Vol. 7, No 1, March 2007 © AUTEX  http://www.autexrj.org/No1- 2007/0192.pdf  56occurs upon exposure to sunlight [13]. Triazine cla ss-hindered amine light stabilisers are used in PP to improve the UV stability. The additi on of HALS to 0.15% weight is  sufficient to improve stability substantially. Even pigmented PP requi res UV stabilisers if the fibres  are exposed to UV during their services [43]. High-energy UV absorbers suitable for PET include derivatives of o-hydroxyphenyl diphenyl triazine, suitable for dye baths, pad liquor or print paste.  UV absorbers have refractive indices of about > 2. 55, by means of which maximum covering capacity and opacity is achieved [12]. The presence of inorganic pigments in the fibres results in more diffuse reflection of light from the subs trate, and provides better protection [9, 12, 30, 32, 50 – 52]. TiO2 added
2 added in the spinning dope for matt effects in the fibres al so acts as a UV absorber [8]. Titanium dioxide and ceramic materials have an absorption capacity in  the UV region between 280 and 400 nm, and reflects visible and IR rays; these absorbers are also added as dope additives [53]. For maximum effect, the particles have to be monomolecularly distributed,  and are often applied in one bath [9, 12, 30, 54]. Nanoscale titanium gel particles strongly bound to the cotton fabrics can give a UPF ≥ 50 without impairing the tensile properties. Brighter visco se yarns provide the highest UV transmittance compared to the dull pigmented viscose yarns, modal  yarns [55]. Zinc oxide nanoparticles, which have a very narrow size distribution (20-40 nm) and minima l aggregation, can result in higher levels of UV blocking [51]. Use of TiO 2, ZnO alone produces less absorption of  UVR than a mixture of (67/33)
titanium dioxide and zinc oxide on cotton and nylon fabrics [32]. Microf ine nylon fabrics with a porosity of 0.1% are capable of givi ng UPF > 50 with 1.5% TiO 2 [52]. Incorporating UV absorber in dyeing decreases the dye uptake slightly, exc ept in post-treatment application [40].  Many commercial products and processes have been dev eloped to produce fabrics with a high level of UPF using various dope additions and topical applications  for almost all types of fabrics produced from cellulosic fibres, wool, silk and synthetic fibres [1, 7, 10 - 12, 20, 36, 44, 56, 57]. Most of the commercial products are compatible with the dyes  and other finishing agents applied to the textile materials, and these agents can be applied usi ng simple padding, the exhaust method, the pad-thermo fix and the pad-dry-cure methods [7, 36, 39, 56, 58].  Textile materials and UV protection  Sun protection involves a combination of sun avoidance and the use of protective garments &
accessories [15, 16]. Reducing the exposure time to  sunlight, using sunscreens and protective clothes are the three ways of protection against the deleter ious effects of UV radiation [17]. Apart from sunscreen lotions, textile materials and accessories m ade of textile materials are largely used for UV protection [2, 3, 7, 10, 12 – 14, 16, 25, 26, 33, 35 - 39, 45, 46, 51,  58, 60 – 67]. UV protection through textiles include various apparels, accessories such  as hats, shoes, shade structures such as umbrellas, awnings, and baby carrier covers and t he fabric materials to produce these items.  Nature of fibres   In textiles, UPF is strongly dependent on the chemical st ructure of the fibres. The nature of the fibres influences the UPFs as they vary in UV transparenc y [7]. Natural fibres like cotton, silk, and wool have a lower degree UVR absorption than synt hetic fibres such as PET [19, 67]. Cotton fabric in a grey
state provides a higher UPF becaus e the natural pigments, pectin,  and waxes act as UV absorbers [2], while bleached fibres have high UV transparenc y. Raw natural fibres like linen and hemp possess
[2], while bleached fibres have high UV transparenc y. Raw natural fibres like linen and hemp possess a UPF of 20 and 10 to 15 respectively, and are not perfe ct UV protectors even wi th lignin content [25]. However, the strong absorption of jute is due to the presence of lignin, which acts as a natural absorber. Protein fibres also have mixed effects in  allowing UV radiation. Dyed cotton fabrics show higher UPF, and undyed, bleached cotton yields very poor UPF values. Wool absorbs strongly in the region of 280 – 400 nm and even beyond 400 nm. Exposure to sunlight damages the quality of silk’s colour, strength and resiliency in both dry and wet condi tions [66]. Mulberry silk is deteriorated to a greater extent than muga silk. Bleached silk and bl eached PAN show very low UPFs of 9.4 and 3.9 respectively. Polyester fibres absor b more in the UV A & UV B regions than aliphatic polyamide fibres.  Moisture and swelling
Moisture and swelling   The ability of textile fibres to provide UV protection varies depending upon the structure and other additives present in the fibres [2, 25, 65, 66 ]. Besides, the construction parameters and wear conditions of the textile materials, moisture and addi tives incorporated in processing also affect the
AUTEX Research Journal, Vol. 7, No 1, March 2007 © AUTEX  http://www.autexrj.org/No1- 2007/0192.pdf  57UPF of the textile materials [13, 16, 25, 64]. In the case of moisture, the influence largely depends on the type and hygroscopicity of fibres, as well as  conditioning time, which result in swelling phenomena [50]. The RH and/or moisture content affect the UPF of the fabric in two ways, namely the swelling of fibres due to moisture absorption, which r educes the interstices, and consequently the UV transmittance. On the other hand, t he presence of water reduces scatteri ng effects, as the refractive index of water is closer to that  of the textile polymer, and hence ther e is a greater UV transmission vis-à-vis a lower UPF [16, 25].  A typical cotton fabric could transmit 15-20% UVR, ri sing to more than 50% if the garment is wet. For adequate protection, the UVR transmission should be lower than 6% and 2.5% for extremely good
protection [13]. Dependence of humidity is more pr onounced in silk and viscose, of which viscose has a higher water absorption and swelling capacity, wh ile silk has poor swelling properties. Even though silk has poor swelling properties, its very fine nat ure and a greater number of fibres in the cross-section of yarn results in higher swelling due to cap illary absorption, and in turn less UV transmittance. Finishing treatments given to the fabrics to reduce swelling reduce t he transmittance of UV rays. In general, hygroscopic fibres and their UPF show better correlation [64].  Fabric construction factors   When the ultraviolet radiation hits the textile mate rials, different types of interactions occur depending upon the substrate and its conditions [3, 11, 13, 15, 16,  21, 25, 41, 47, 60, 65, 68]. The UV protection by textile materials and apparel is a function of the chemical characteristics,  physico-chemical type of
fibre, presence of UV absorbers, c onstruction of fabric, thickness, por osity, extension of the fabric, moisture content of the fabrics, co lour and the finishing given to the fabric [12, 13, 16, 21, 60]. A part of the radiation is reflected at the boundaries of  the textile surface. The UVR transmitted through textile fabrics consists of the unchanged waves that pass through the interstices of the fabrics as well as scattered waves that have interacted with the fabrics. Another part is absorbed when it penetrates the sample, and is converted into a different energy form. The portion of radiation that travels through the fabric and reaches the skin is appropriately  referred to as the ‘transmission component’.  The UPF increases with fabric density and thi ckness for similar construction, and is dependent on porosity (UPF = 100 / porosity) [7]. A high correlati on exists between the UPF and the fabric porosity
but is also influenced by the type of fibres [69]. T he relative order of importance for the UV protection is given by % cover > fibre type > fabric thickness [65]. Cloth cover does not consider the flatness of the yarns, which might result in a higher cloth co ver than the calculated value. A UPF with fabric weight and thickness shows better correlation than cloth cover [28]. Therefore fabrics with the maximum number of yarns in warp and weft give high UPFs.  UPF values of 200, 40, 20 and 10 can be achieved with the percentage cover factors of 99.5, 97.5, 95 and 90 re spectively [15]. The percentage UVR transmission of a fabric is rela ted to the fabric cover factor by  (100 – cover factor) and the UPF is given by UPF = 100 / (100-CF) [65]. To achieve a mi nimum UPF rating of 15, the cover factor of the textile must be greater than 93%, and a very small in crease in CF leads to substantial improvements
in the UPF of the textiles above 95% cover factor. In the case of terry cloth, a high variability in UPF exists due to irregularities in the fabric constr uction [3]. Woven fabrics usually have a higher cover
exists due to irregularities in the fabric constr uction [3]. Woven fabrics usually have a higher cover factor than knits due to the type of construction [ 47]. Thick rib structures of hemp and linen can allow 10.52 – 12.70% and 9.03 – 11.47% of UV  A and UV B respectively [25]. However, knitted structure made from a blend of synthetic fibres with Lycra o ffers the best protection against solar radiation [68], and warp-knitted blinds are capable of screening up to 80% of the solar radiation and bright glares.   Stretching reduces the UPF rating of the fabric duri ng wear, as the effective cover factor is reduced [16]. However, the cover factor can be modifi ed through many dry finishing processes through overfeed on the stenter, compressive shrinkage proce sses such as compacting and sanforising, which are normally used to obtain dimensional stability, incidentally increasing the cover factor and hence
the UPF. Gentle milling employed in the case of lightweight wool fabrics can also enhance the cover factor and the UPF [15].  Dyeing and finishing  Depending upon the type of dye or pigment, the absorpt ive groups present in the dyestuff, depth after dyeing, the uniformity and additives, the UV protection abilities of the textile materials are considerably influenced [3, 7, 16, 35, 39, 41, 60, 64, 67]. In a gi ven fabric, higher transmission of UV radiation is
AUTEX Research Journal, Vol. 7, No 1, March 2007 © AUTEX  http://www.autexrj.org/No1- 2007/0192.pdf  58observed in the case of bright fibres (viscose) t han dull fibres [39]. A protective effect can be obtained by dyeing or printing, which is better than using heavyweight fabrics which are not suitable for summer conditions. Darker colours of the same fabric ty pe (black, navy, dark red) absorb UVR much more strongly than the light pastel colours for identical weave with UPF, in the ranges of 18 – 37 and 19 – 34 for cotton and polyester respectively [3, 35]. So me direct, reactive and vat dyes are capable of giving a UPF of 50+ [16]. Some of the direct dyes  substantially increase t he UPF of bleached cloth, which depends on the relative transmittance of the dyes  in the UV B region. In many cases, a UPF calculated using a direct dye solution appears to be higher  than that of the fabric  after dyeing, mainly
because the actual concentrations are mostly less t han the theoretical concent ration. Dyes extracted from various natural resources also show the UPF within the range of 15 – 45 depending on the mordant used [70].  Cellulosic fabrics transmit UV A and UV B equally with the transmittance ratio (T A/TB) 0.9. When dyed with the reactive dyes, the UPF increases fr om 4.7 to 5.0 – 14.0 depending upon the concentration, which is not sufficient to satisfy the minimum r equirements [60]. Some of the vinyl sulphone dyes and monochlorotriazine dyes possess UV R absorption characteristics, which also increase with the concentration. Cellulosic fabrics dyed with these dyes show reduc ed UVR transmission from 24.6% to 10-20% and 27.8% to 8-22% for UV A and UV B respec tively. When mixtures of these dyes are used, the UPF increases synergistically. Some combinations  of disperse reactive mix can give prolonged UV protection with a UPF of 50+ for P/C blends [46].
Optical brightening agents or fabric whitening agents are used at the finishing operations, as well as in the wash cycles, and their effect on UPFs has been demonstrated extensively in the past [7, 16, 42, 46, 62, 67, 71, 72]. Optical brightening agents are often applied to enhance the whiteness of textiles by UV excitation and visible blue emission. T he phenomenon of excitation and emission is caused by the transition of electrons involv ing p-orbitals from either conj ugated or aromatic compounds [46]. Most optical brighteners have excitation maxima within the range of 340 – 400 nm. OBA can improve the UPF of cotton and cotton blends, but not of fabrics that are 100%  polyester or nylon [16]. The presence of OBA in the P/C blends (67/33) to the ex tent of 0.5% can improv e the UPF from 16.3 to 32.2, which is more or less closer to that obt ained using the UV absorbers with 0.2% (UPF 35.5).
Washing the fabrics leads to a loss of UPF in t he case of OBA-treated fabrics, and the UPF reaches the level of that in untreated fabric after 10 wa shes, which shows the semi-permanent nature of the finish and protection [46]. Another lim itation of many OBAs is that t hey mostly absorb in the UVA part of the day light spectrum (93% ) but have a weak absorption in UV absorption around 308 nm (92%), which plays an important role in skin disease [6, 71].  UPF measurement systems  Appropriate precaution which were applied while ca rrying out the measurement should be sufficient to collect all the scattered and transmitted lights th rough an integrating sphere, to include all the erythemal active wavelengths (UVA & UVB) s pectral measurements without any influence of fluorescence from FWA, if it is present in the fabr ic [63]. There are currently 12 sites in Australia and Antarctica installed with broadband UVR detectors to  measure the total energy received over a range
of wavelength in UVR region in both direct and diffuse radiation [21]. Polysulphone films have been
of wavelength in UVR region in both direct and diffuse radiation [21]. Polysulphone films have been widely used in the construction of personal dosimeter s, which absorb strongly in the UV B region [5, 38, 73, 74].  The instrument for measuring fabric transmission includes broadband radiometers, spectroradiometers, or spectrophotometers, and X enon lamps [14, 16, 19, 30, 46, 75]. Filters are placed next to the test specimen to prevent the effe cts of fluorescence reaching the integrating sphere [5, 7, 29, 55]. The spectral response of the det ector is also important in determining system performance, and it must be capable of detecting UVR accurately and linearly over a very large range of intensities and discriminating the signal from the detector dark current. Many commercial systems have difficulty in measuring UPFs above 100 due to dynamic range, dark curr ent discrimination at
lower wavelengths of <300 nm, and fluorescence at wa velengths of >380 nm. Low light levels in the UVR source used for measurement can also lead to difficulty in distinguishing between the transmitted UVR and the natural dark cu rrent of the detector.  The measurement of UPF on a clothing material can be carried out by measuring the diffuse spectral transmittance in vitro  or by measuring the increase in expos ure time required to induce erythema or

The preparation of the fabric prior to the UV transmission test includes the exposure of specimen to laundering, simulated sunlight and chlorinated pool water, and to present in a state that simulate the conditions at the end of two years of normal seasonal use, so that the UV protection level fina lly stated on the label estimates the maximum transmittance of the garment fabric during a two-year life cycle [75].  UV protection care labelling  Initiatives for developing standards related to UV protection started in the 1990s, and standards related to the preparation of fabrics, test ing and guidance for UV protection labelling have been formulated [12, 76, 77, 78] by different agencies. Care labelling similar to fabric and garment care labels has been developed for UV protection, and standard procedures have been established for the
measurement, calculation, labelling methods and compar ison of label values [12, 26, 61, 64, 71, 76, 77, 79 - 82] of textile products. Since 1981, the Sk in Cancer Foundation, an international body, has offered a Seal of Recommendation for the photo- protective products which includes sunscreens, sunglasses, window films and laundry detergent addi tives, in accordance with AATCC TM 183 or AS/NZS 4399; the products recommended are reviewed annually [61].   Table 2.  Grades and classification of UPF UPF Transmission (%) Classification Grade > 40 < 2.5 Excellent protection III 30-40 3.3 – 2.5 Very good protection II 20-29 5.0 – 2.4 Good protection I  UV labelling is an additional requirement besides other labelling requirements of garments including Permanent Care Labels and Fibre Content labels. Apar t from the UPF label, block numbers can also be used based on the UV transmittance value in thei r respective UVR range [26, 61]. Table 2 shows
the various grades and the related protection factors for the textile materials. The UPF value to be placed on the label is that of the sample, r educed by its standard error of UPF values, and then rounded down to the nearest multiple of 5 but not great er than 50. A UPF of 20 m eans that 1/20th, i.e. 5%, of the biologically effective UV radiation striking the surface of t he fabric actually passes through it [71].  Conclusion  The best technique for reducing UV exposure is to avoid sun exposure, but this is an unacceptable solution to all. Recreational exposure accounts for most of the significant  UVR exposures of the population, and occupational exposure is also signifi cant. However, there is growing interest in reducing the UVR exposure of outdoor  workers. This necessitates the development of stronger UV absorbers which will be especially suitable for low UPF fibres, which are highly preferred by the
