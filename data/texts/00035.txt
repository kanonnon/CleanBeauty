Hair loss is a common complaint in the outpa-tient setting. Frequently, patients conduct theirown research on hair loss diagnosis and treat-ment and are faced with a number of manufac-turers’ claims that their products will benefit hairloss. This paper explores the truth behind thoseclaims of hair regrowth. We intend for this infor-mation to serve as a “consumer report” forhealthcare providers and patients and to helpseparate some of the valid claims for hairregrowth from those that are purely fiction.Cutis. 2004;73:107-114.Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a commonpatient complaint, affecting approximately halfof all men and women by the age of 50 years.1Hair loss often can have significant negative effectsHair Loss Remedies—Separating Fact From FictionIlian Bandaranayake, BA; Paradi Mirmirani, MDAccepted for publication January 12, 2004.

on self-esteem and body image.2Clinicians maybe bombarded by questions from patients whohave information about hair loss remedies fromthe Internet or testimonials from friends. How-ever, it may be difficult or time-consuming fordoctors to learn about the dozens of productsclaiming to promote hair growth and to thenappropriately counsel their patients. In this arti-cle, we have interposed information obtainedfrom the Internet with that obtained from peer-reviewed journals, when available, to support orrefute claims made by the manufacturers or mar-keters of various products. We intend for thisinformation to serve as a “consumer report” forhealthcare providers and patients and help to sep-arate some of the valid claims for hair regrowthfrom those that are purely fiction.FDA-Approved Hair Loss RemediesMinoxidil —In 1988, the US Food and Drug
Minoxidil —In 1988, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved minoxidil 2% topical solution for use in treating AGA inmen. A 2% solution marketed toward womenbecame available in 1991, and a 5% solution foruse in men became available over-the-counter in1997.3Since that time, generic formulations ofminoxidil topical solution also have becomeavailable. Minoxidil is a vasodilator and a potas-sium channel opener,3but its mechanism ofaction in promoting hair regrowth is unknownand appears to be independent of its vasodilata-tion properties.3-7The most common adverse sideeffects of minoxidil topical solution include scalpirritation, which occurs in about 7% of patientsusing the 2% solution, and hypertrichosis, whichis noted in women.3Because there are bothgeneric and brand-name formulations of minoxi-dil topical solution, the cost of this therapy variesdepending on which solution patients choose.However, most consumers pay between $10 and$20 for a 1-month supply.8
8Minoxidil 2% topical solution has been provento be effective both in stimulating new hairgrowth and in helping to prevent continued hairloss in both sexes.3A recent study comparingminoxidil 2% and 5% topical solution in menshowed that the men using the extra-strengthformulation had 45% more hair regrowth after 48 weeks and an earlier response to the drug.9Astudy published in 1992 showed that a year’s treat-ment with minoxidil 5% was effective in improv-ing hair density in 9 women,10though thecompany has not yet obtained FDA approval forthe use of this concentration in women. Minoxidiltopical solution has even been found to be effec-tive and safe in adolescents, which is an importantfinding because AGA can occur in older childrenor teenagers and can cause significant psychologi-cal distress.11Some Web sites are claiming that products used
11Some Web sites are claiming that products usedin combination with minoxidil can increase thedrug’s efficacy. For example, the Hair Loss ControlClinic Web site claims that sebum on the hairfollicle at the level of the scalp prevents minoxi-dil’s penetration into the hair follicle, causing it tobe absorbed ineffectively.12The site also claimsthat the high alcohol content of over-the-counterminoxidil can cause hair damage. The clinic ispromoting a product called HLCC Scalp TherapyDexpanthenol 12% to be used prior to shampooingto dissolve sebum, theoretically allowing theminoxidil solution to better penetrate the hair fol-licle.12Another product advertised on this site isCarrier Enhancement Agent, which supposedlyneutralizes the alcohol in minoxidil to preventscalp irritation.12There are no peer-reviewed stud-ies supporting these claims. Because it is unclearhow minoxidil topical solution works, it also isunclear why such additives would increase itseffectiveness.
Patients also may see Web sites promoting theuse of retinoids with minoxidil to enhance minox-idil’s effectiveness. To date, one nonblinded studytested tretinoin 0.025% combined with minoxidil0.5% topical solution in 36 patients and showedthat the tretinoin increased the percutaneousabsorption of the minoxidil. The combination ofthe 2 drugs led to visible hair growth in 66% of thepatients tested.
13Therefore, the application of bothtopical minoxidil solution and tretinoin may givesome patients better results than application oftopical minoxidil alone. Patients may want to tryminoxidil by itself at first and then add thetretinoin only if they are not satisfied with theirinitial results.Finasteride —In 1997, finasteride was approvedby the FDA for treatment of male AGA at a doseof 1 mg/d.3This medication is a competitiveinhibitor of type-2 5 α-reductase, which inhibitstestosterone’s conversion to dihydrotestosterone(DHT).14-17Finasteride is able to decrease serumDHT by about 70%.18Due to the potential forteratogenic effects in male fetuses, finasteride isnot FDA approved for use in women.3The mainside effects of finasteride therapy are sexual sideeffects such as decreased libido and erectile/ejacu-latory dysfunction, which occurred in fewer than2% of men in one trial. In one study, these nega-tive side effects were reversed with cessation of themedication.
19Also, there have been no clinicallyHair Loss Remedies108 CUTIS®
significant drug interactions noted between finas-teride and other medications.20The cost of thisdrug averages between $30 and $60 per month.8Multiple randomized double-blind clinical trialsof finasteride versus placebo in men aged 18 to 41 years with both vertex and frontal hair thinningshowed that patients who took finasteride 1 mg/dfor one year had significantly increased scalpcoverage and hair counts than patients takingplacebo.19,21,22With continuous treatment of finas-teride daily for 2 years, approximately two thirds ofmen have improved hair regrowth, one third ofmen see no change, and approximately 1% of menactually have less hair than at baseline.3This prod-uct has shown more efficacy in younger men thanit has in men older than 60 years, most likelybecause of decreased scalp type-2 5 α-reductaseactivity in older men.3Finasteride also has been tested for efficacy in
Finasteride also has been tested for efficacy inwomen with AGA. A randomized double-blindstudy of 137 postmenopausal women with AGAwho took finasteride 1 mg/d or placebo for oneyear showed no significant difference in haircount between the 2 groups. In fact, both groupsof patients actually showed significant loss of hairduring the study period.23Another randomizedopen-label study tested finasteride 5 mg/d versusno treatment in premenopausal women withhyperandrogenic alopecia and elevated serumandrogens (levels >2 SD above the mean in ovu-latory control patients). This study found thatthe women using finasteride at this elevated dosedid not see any significant improvement asopposed to the women receiving no treatment.24Some clinicians have had more success with theuse of finasteride in their female patients withAGA. In a letter published in the British Journalof Dermatology , 2 physicians describe successful
of Dermatology , 2 physicians describe successfultreatment of AGA in a postmenopausal womanwho was given finasteride 5 mg/wk. Success wasmeasured via patient report of improved hairdensity and review of stereotactic photographs ofthe scalp.25Despite this anecdotal evidence ofsuccess, the larger body of evidence weighsagainst the use of finasteride in postmenopausalwomen with AGA.Because there are only 2 FDA-approved treat-ments for AGA, patients may wonder which ismore effective. In a recent letter published in theArchives of Dermatology , finasteride 1 mg/d wascompared with topical minoxidil 2% in 99 menaged 18 to 45 years with mid frontal and/or vertexhair thinning.26The researchers found that bothtreatments worked equally well in stopping theprogression of hair loss in patients; however,patients given minoxidil had quicker initialimprovement whereby patients given finasteridehad slightly better results as treatment progressed.26
26Choice of treatment therefore may be more a factorof side-effect profile, expense, and preferred formof medication (oral vs topical).Some patients may ask about combining finas-teride with minoxidil. One case study described theimprovement of one man’s alopecia from Hamilton-Norwood class V to class III after using a combina-tion therapy of finasteride 5 mg/d plus a topicalsolution of minoxidil 3% and tretinoin 0.01%.27The combined use of finasteride and minoxidiltopical solution has been studied in the animalmodel of AGA; in stumptail macaques, the com-bined use of finasteride with minoxidil had greatereffects on hair loss than either treatment alone.28Because both treatments have different modes ofaction, it is plausible that combining them mayyield better results.Off-Label Uses for FDA-ApprovedMedicationsSpironolactone— This medication is often pre-
Spironolactone— This medication is often pre-scribed for the treatment of hypertension becauseof its action as an aldosterone antagonist, but italso is able to inhibit the biosynthesis of andro-gens and to competitively inhibit androgenreceptor protein binding.29The main side effectsof this medication are menstrual irregularities,hyperkalemia, gynecomastia in men, and gas-trointestinal distress.29Women using this medi-
29The main side effectsof this medication are menstrual irregularities,hyperkalemia, gynecomastia in men, and gas-trointestinal distress.29Women using this medi-cation must be warned about the potential forfeminization of male fetuses if pregnancy occursduring the course of treatment.30The cost of thismedication at a dose of 200 mg/d is approxi-mately $60 per month, though it typically is cov-ered by insurance policies.8Spironolactone has shown efficacy in treatingwomen with hirsutism,31and it also may have mildefficacy in treating AGA at a dose of 200 mg/d.32One study examining the efficacy of spironolac-tone in women with AGA showed that thewomen taking the medication had less hair lossthan control patients after one year, but thewomen taking spironolactone still did not havemore hair after treatment than at the start of thestudy.33Another study that examined the use of
33Another study that examined the use ofspironolactone 200 mg/d in 2 men and 2 womenwith AGA showed that the patients had anincrease in the number of hairs in anagen phasefrom 22% at baseline to 84.5% at the end of 6 months of treatment.34Because this medicationonly has weak evidence for its use as a treatment forhair loss, clinicians should consider this medi cationHair Loss RemediesVOLUME 73, FEBRUARY 2004 109
only in addition to other, more proven, means oftherapy.Yasmin®—This is an oral contraceptive pillcomposed of ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone, ananalogue of spironolactone. Each pill containsdrospirenone 3 mg, which is equivalent to spirono-lactone 25 mg.35According to the manufacturer ofYasmin, this oral contraceptive antagonizes androgenreceptors without affecting sex-hormone–bindingglobulin synthesis or affect ing the binding oftestosterone to sex-hormone–binding globulin.The manufacturer also claims that the druginhibits ovarian androgen production.36The mostcommon side effects are similar to side effects ofother oral contraceptives and include breast tenderness, nausea, headache, emotional lability,dysmenorrhea, intermenstrual bleeding, anddepression.35Some insurance plans will cover thecost of oral contraceptives, but for patients payingout of pocket, Yasmin costs approximately $30 permonth.8Because spironolactone is sometimes pre-
8Because spironolactone is sometimes pre-scribed for AGA, some clinicians recommendYasmin to patients with alopecia who also arelooking for effective contraceptive methods.However, to our knowledge, there are no knownpublished studies showing that Yasmin preventshair loss or promotes hair regrowth. Becausespironolactone has shown only slight efficacy intreatment of women with AGA,3it is unclearwhat the effect of Yasmin may be on hair loss.However, this may be a reasonable choice of con-traceptive in a woman with AGA.Dutasteride —This new 5 α-reductase inhibitorblocks both type-1 and type-2 isoenzymes.37Byinhibiting both types of 5 α-reductase, dutasteride isable to achieve a greater than 90% suppression ofDHT.37This medication was developed for the treat-ment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, with sideeffects similar to those of finasteride.38As with finas-teride, women are advised not to take this productbecause of the potential risk of birth defects in malefetuses.
37In November 2002, dutasteride wasapproved by the FDA for use in patients with benignprostatic hyperplasia.39This medication costsapproximately $75 for a 1-month supply.8Although dutasteride is not yet FDA approvedfor alopecia, the manufacturers have completedphase 2 clinical trials of the medication for thetreatment of hair loss and are hopeful it will beapproved by the FDA in 2006.40There are no stud-ies published regarding this medication’s effect onAGA, but preliminary results from the manufacturershowed that dutasteride reduced scalp DHT in mento a greater extent than finasteride.41Herbal/Dietary RemediesSaw Palmetto —Saw palmetto, or Serenoa repens , isan herbal remedy that is processed from fruit ofthe American dwarf pine tree.42It often is used totreat benign prostatic hypertrophy because of itsability to inhibit 5 α-reductase levels by 32%without affecting testosterone levels in men.43
without affecting testosterone levels in men.43Extracts of saw palmetto also have been shown tohave a partial antagonistic affect on testosteronereceptors.44It is most likely that these 2 actionsled to saw palmetto being used as a hair loss rem-edy. Saw palmetto is believed to be a safe herbalsupplement, with a primary side effect of mildgastrointestinal distress.42Also, clinical trialsconducted in human patients showed that con-sumption of saw palmetto supplements did notresult in any clinically significant alterations inlaboratory parameters.45Saw palmetto has noknown drug interactions.42The cost of this sup-plement varies by manufacturer, but consumersshould be able to find saw palmetto supplementsfor as little as $3 for a month’s supply.8One double-blind placebo-controlled studyexamined saw palmetto’s effect on AGA.46In thisstudy, researchers studied the efficacy of a softgelcontaining β-sitosterol 50 mg and saw palmetto200 mg extract (components of the HairGenesis™

study, researchers studied the efficacy of a softgelcontaining β-sitosterol 50 mg and saw palmetto200 mg extract (components of the HairGenesis™Softgels discussed later) versus placebo in treatingAGA. They found that 60% of patients taking theactive softgel rated their hair growth as improvedfrom baseline as opposed to only 10% of thepatients taking placebo. However, this study had alimited patient population and also concurrentlytested β-sitosterol, so any improvement cannot beattributed to saw palmetto alone.Biotin —This is a water-soluble B complexvitamin that is used in the body as a cofactor forbiochemical carboxylations. Patients that aredeficient in this vitamin often have alopecia,brittle nails, and a scaly erythematous dermati-tis.47,48Biotin is water-soluble, and there are noknown side effects of supplementation and nodocumented cases of biotin overdose.49As with
49As withother supplements, cost of treatment will dependon the manufacturer, but consumers should beable to find biotin for as little as $2 for a month’ssupply.8Dietary supplementation with biotin has beenshown to improve the clinical condition of brit-tle nails,48but no studies have been conductedlooking at biotin’s effect on AGA. Although it istrue that biotin deficiency can lead to alopecia,such a deficiency has not been demonstrated inhealthy humans eating a mixed diet.47The only2 situations in which human biotin deficiency hasHair Loss Remedies110 CUTIS®
been demonstrated are in patients with extendedconsumption of raw egg whites50-52and in patientswith malabsorption syndromes receiving parenteralnutrition without biotin supplementation.50,53Supplementing the diet with biotin is unlikely toharm a patient, but there is no data to suggest anyimprovement in hair regrowth.Other Hair Regrowth ProductsAvacor™—Sold through the Internet and directlyfrom the manufacturer, Avacor is a hair regrowthproduct marketed toward both sexes for treatmentof AGA.54The product line consists of a scalp
54The product line consists of a scalpdetoxifying shampoo, an herbal supplement, and atopical solution. The purpose of the shampoo asstated by the manufacturer is to deep clean thescalp to improve the absorbency of the topicaltreatment. The herbal supplements are to betaken twice daily to “maintain a healthy hair fol-licle” and consist of bilberry, ginkgo biloba, sawpalmetto, and horsetail. The topical solution,which is marketed to men only, claims to dilateblood vessels in the scalp, allowing increasednutrient and oxygen delivery to the scalp. TheWeb site claims that these products must be usedtogether and that they have no known sideeffects.54The cost of this product is $239.95 for a3-month supply.55The official Avacor Web site has a summary of aclinical study performed by The New York HairClinic and the Hair and Skin Treatment Center inwhich 200 men aged 18 to 65 years used the 3-partsystem for 24 weeks.55The Web site claims that 91%
55The Web site claims that 91%of the men had a decrease in hair loss and anincrease in strength and thickness of preexistinghair within 3 months.55However, this study does notappear to be published in any journal and consumerscan only receive a copy of the study if they purchasethe product.A Wellness Letter highlighting dietary supple-ments, published by the University of California atBerkeley, showed that Avacor contains minoxidilin its topical solution despite its claims to be madefrom only natural ingredients.56In April 2003, theFDA sent the makers of Avacor a letter informingthem that their products are considered drugsunder section 201(g) of the Federal Food, Drug,and Cosmetic Act and should have had anapproved New Drug Application prior to beingmarketed in the United States. The FDA alsopoints out that the 3 individual components aremislabeled because the active ingredients are notlisted on their labels.57Given the lack of peer-reviewed evidence of hair
Given the lack of peer-reviewed evidence of hairgrowth and with all of the controversy surroundingthis product, it would not be wise for clinicians torecommend this therapy to any patient.HairGenesis™—This product line consists of 4 items: Revitalizing Oral Softgel™supplements (β-sitosterol 50 mg and saw palmetto 200 mgextract) that claim to strengthen and protect hair;Topical Activator Serum that consists of various 5 α-reductase inhibitors; Hair Revitalizing Formu lation,a shampoo that has similar components to theTopical Activator Serum; and Hair and ScalpConditioner that also is meant to strengthen andprotect hair. Although the company states thatthe products may be used individually, it recom-mends using them all synergistically, at a cost of$200 for a 3-month supply.58The efficacy of theoral softgel containing saw palmetto is discussedabove; there are no known research studiespublished about the other 3 components of theHairGenesis system.Nioxin
Nioxin®—This product line is sold onlythrough hair salons and does not aim to regrowhair; rather, it claims to “create an optimum scalpenvironment” for regrowth and maintenance ofthe current hair count. The manufacturer claimsto accomplish this by clearing the scalp of excesssebum that may contain high levels of DHT.Ingredients include various vitamin-B coen-zymes, biotin, saw palmetto, aloe, ginseng, andamino acids. The manufacturer claims that theNioxin system has no known side effects.59As
59Asthis product is sold only in salons, the cost for amonth’s supply will vary depending on the placeof purchase. One salon that we contacted offereda one-month starter kit for $30. The manufac-turer does not disclose its clinical studies butclaims that its studies are conducted by “world-renowned” researchers who are experts in hairthinning.59However, there is no known pub-lished scientific evidence that any of the ingredi-ents in Nioxin are effective in treating hair lossor maintaining hair count, or that excess sebumleads to hair thinning.Laser Light Therapy —Low-intensity laser lighttherapy has been shown to be effective in pro-moting wound healing60and in improving circu-lation.61,62For these reasons, some hair loss
lation.61,62For these reasons, some hair losstreatment centers are offering the use of lasers fortreating alopecia in both men and women. Todate, there are no known studies looking at theefficacy of these lasers for treating hair loss. Theuse of low-intensity laser light for treating alope-cia is FDA approved for safety only, not forefficacy.29This therapy is expensive, costing asmuch as $3500 for the recommended 6 months oftreatment.63Hair Loss RemediesVOLUME 73, FEBRUARY 2004 111
Although various Web sites claim efficacybased on double-blind placebo-controlled studiesof laser light treatment versus placebo laser treat-ment,64,65such studies are not available for viewinganywhere on the Web sites. To the best of ourknowledge, there are no peer-reviewed articlessupporting efficacy of this type of treatment forAGA. Until reli able evidence of the effectivenessof laser light therapy for alopecia is published, thistreatment remains experimental, at best.Conclusion
ConclusionAny consumer looking on the Internet for a treat-ment for hair loss is exposed to a multitude ofremedies. However, only the FDA-approved treat-ments for AGA, finasteride and minoxidil, haveany well-studied factual evidence of efficacy.Smaller studies have shown possible benefit ofcombining topical tretinoin with minoxidil, aswell as combining finasteride and minoxidil.Spironolactone in high doses (100–200 mg),dutasteride, and saw palmetto, also may providebenefit; however, larger studies are needed to con-sider these agents as first-line treatments forAGA. In addition to efficacy, clinicians need toconsider patient preferences, safety profile, andcost when counseling patients about treatmentoptions for AGA.REFERENCES1. Olsen EA. Androgenetic alopecia.
