Bioactive Lipid Mediator Proﬁles in HumanPsoriasis Skin and BloodAlexander V. Sorokin1, Anthony F. Domenichiello2, Amit K. Dey1, Zhi-Xin Yuan2, Aditya Goyal1,Shawn M. Rose3, Martin P. Playford1, Christopher E. Ramsden2,4,5and Nehal N. Mehta1Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated disease that represents a unique model for investigating inﬂammationat local and systemic levels. Bioactive lipid mediators (LMs) are potent compounds reported to play a role in thedevelopment and resolution of inﬂammation. Currently, it is not known to what extent these LMs are involved
in psoriasis pathophysiology and related metabolic dysfunction. Here, we use targeted and untargeted liquidchromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approaches to quantify LMs in skin and peripheral blood frompsoriasis patients and compared them with those of healthy individuals. Lesional psoriasis skin was abundant inarachidonic acid metabolites, as 8-, 12- and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, compared with adjacent nonle-sional and skin from healthy individuals. Additionally, a linoleic acid-derived LM, 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoicacid, was signiﬁcantly increased compared with healthy skin (607.9 ng/g vs. 5.4 ng/g, P¼0.001). These psoria-sis skin differences were accompanied by plasma decreases in antioxidant markers, including glutathione, andimpaired lipolysis characterized by lower concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids. In conclusion,
our study shows that psoriasis skin and blood have disease-speciﬁc phenotype proﬁles of bioactive LMsrepresented by omega-6 fatty acid eoxidized derivatives. These ﬁndings provide insights into psoriasis patho-physiology that could potentially contribute to new biomarkers and therapeutics.Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2018) 138, 1518e1528; doi:10.1016/j.jid.2018.02.003INTRODUCTIONPsoriasis comprises a group of immune-mediated inﬂamma-tory skin diseases that are closely correlated with metabolicand cardiovascular comorbidities ( Ryan and Kirby, 2015 ).Psoriasis pathogenesis involves disbalance in effective anti-inﬂammatory and immune responses regulated by complexmultisystemic interactions. However, the molecular basis forthese biochemical abnormalities are poorly understood.Omega-6 (or n-6) and omega-3 (or n-3) polyunsaturated
fatty acids (PUFAs) are the main source of bioactive LMsstored in the skin. Linoleic (LA) and arachidonic (AA) acidsare the most abundant omega-6 PUFAs in human epidermis(McCusker and Grant-Kels, 2010 ). Oxidized LMs derivedfrom LA (known as OXLAMs) and AA (known as eicosanoids)have numerous inﬂammation-related functions ( Strassburget al., 2012 ). In turn, the enzymatic conversion of eicosa-pentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids byomega-3 PUFAs leads to the synthesis of a potent class ofmediators known as specialized pro-resolving LMs ( Zhangand Spite, 2012 ), which exert anti-inﬂammatory and immu-nomodulating effects ( Serhan, 2007 ).So far, there are no clinical trials investigating the bioactivelipid proﬁle of psoriasis skin and peripheral blood from thesame group of patients. Previous studies have identiﬁed alimited number of LMs in psoriatic skin ( Camp et al., 1988;Hammarstrom et al., 1975 ) and peripheral blood
Hammarstrom et al., 1975 ) and peripheral blood(Corrocher et al., 1989 ) for eicosanoid presence, butcomprehensive analysis has been completed only for healthyhuman skin ( Kendall et al., 2015 ). Omega-3 and omega-6PUFAs cannot be synthesized de novo by humans; there-fore, the abundance of these omega-6/3 fatty acids andrelated metabolites in psoriatic skin is likely to be regulatedby diet. Various clinical approaches have been used todetermine whether changing the omega-6/omega-3 ratio bydiet or pharmacological interventions might be beneﬁcial inindividuals with inﬂammation-associated conditions ( Bardenet al., 2016; Ramsden et al., 2012 ), as well as in healthyindividuals ( Markworth et al., 2016 ). Hence, we hypothe-
individuals with inﬂammation-associated conditions ( Bardenet al., 2016; Ramsden et al., 2012 ), as well as in healthyindividuals ( Markworth et al., 2016 ). Hence, we hypothe-sized that imbalance in these mediators could contribute topsoriasis pathogenesis.However, some of these lipid autacoids, though extremelypotent, are present only in minute concentrations (fmol/Lepmol/L range), which demands a highly sensitive diag-nostic technique. Skin lipidomic analysis is suggested asbeing a fast and reliable tool for estimating and monitoring1Section of Inﬂammation and Cardiometabolic Diseases, Cardio-PulmonaryBranch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes ofHealth, Bethesda, Maryland, USA;2Lipid Mediators, Inﬂammation, andPain Unit, Laboratory of Clinical Investigation, National Institute on Aging,National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA;3Bristol-MyersSquibb Clinical Development, Princeton, New Jersey, USA;4Intramural

the progression of inﬂammatory skin diseases ( Li et al.,2016 ). For this reason, we used LM metabololipidomicsusing highly sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem massspectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify bioactive LMs inhuman skin and peripheral blood of psoriasis patients andhealthy individuals.RESULTSStudy populationDemographic and clinical characteristics of the psoriasis (n ¼60) and corresponding healthy (n ¼30) study populationsenrolled for plasma analysis are presented in SupplementaryTable S1 online. Participants were white males withoutknown history of tobacco or alcohol use and a mean age of48 years.A separate set of participants had paired lesional andnonlesional skin (n ¼8), along with serum analysis,compared with corresponding healthy volunteers (n ¼7) (seeSupplementary Table S2 online). Recruitment and studydesign were based on the ongoing prospective observationalstudy ( Naik et al., 2015 ) (see Supplementary Materialsonline).
online).Metabolomic proﬁling of psoriatic and healthy plasmaBesides clinically evident local skin inﬂammation, psoriaticdisease has a signiﬁcant systemic inﬂammatory component,which was investigated by proﬁling circulating mediatorsattributed to inﬂammatory and metabolic dysfunction. Toaddress this task, ultra-high performance LC-MS/MS combinedwith gas chromatography/MS was used. LC-MS/MS ebasedmetabololipidomics was performed on plasma from 60psoriasis patients and 30 corresponding healthy individuals. Atotal of 557 compounds of known identity were quantiﬁed,with 98 up-regulated and 52 down-regulated metabolitesshowing a level of signiﬁcance less than or equal to 0.05. Acomplete list of metabolites identiﬁed in human plasma isavailable in the Supplementary Materials online.Higher presence of fatty acid monohydroxy and methylester forms was accompanied by medium-chain and long-chain fatty acids ( Figure 1 ). One striking and consistent
observation was a higher abundance of omega-3/6 PUFAs inplasma from patients with psoriasis. These differences wereaccompanied by a signiﬁcant 2-fold increase in LA hydroxyfatty acids (9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid [HODE])in psoriasis patients ( Figure 2 ). AA-derived LMs, such asLTB4, PGE2, and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE)were not signiﬁcantly different between compared groups.These changes were accompanied by 1.4-fold ( P<0.01)elevation in glycerol and several acylcarnitines. Conse-quently, the key intracellular antioxidant markers of gluta-thione andg-glutamyl were signiﬁcantly decreased inpsoriasis plasma. Because the production of glutathione andits pathway markers depends on methyl group donors, weexpected to see a reduction in methionine and cysteine inpsoriasis patients ( Figure 2 ).Also, a dysfunctional bile acid proﬁle in psoriasis patients
was characterized by lower concentrations of the conjugatedprimary bile acids, glycocholate and glycochenodeox-ycholate, along with such secondary bile acids as taur-odeoxycholate and glycodeoxycholate ( Figure 2 ). Thesechanges contributed to the signiﬁcant elevation in plasmacholesterol precursors, such as lathosterol and oxidized de-rivative 7-b-hydroxycholesterol, in the psoriasis group.Consistent elevations in metabolites related to purine andpyrimidine nucleotide metabolism, such as adenosine 50-diphosphate, was 4.5-fold ( P<0.01) higher in the psoriasisgroup ( Figure 2 ). Also, the purine degradation (xanthosine) andthe pyrimidine degradation products (5,6-dihydrothymine)were signiﬁcantly higher in patients with psoriasis.Some additional representatives of the endocannabinoidand sphingolipid metabolite classes were altered in patientswith psoriasis ( Figure 2 ). Excessive nucleotide accumulationand altered phospholipase activity might be responsible for
the observed 1.3-fold ( P<0.05) N-stearoyl taurine andN-palmitoyl taurine increase in psoriasis plasma. This obser-
and altered phospholipase activity might be responsible forthe observed 1.3-fold ( P<0.05) N-stearoyl taurine andN-palmitoyl taurine increase in psoriasis plasma. This obser-vation was also accompanied by accumulation of sphinganine,palmitoyl sphingomyelin, and stearoyl sphingomyelin, with asphingosine 1-phosphate decrease in the psoriasis group. Inaddition, the 3.9-fold increase in serotonin level may be ofparticular interest because expression of its transporter protein,SERT, is altered in psoriatic lesions, which may contribute toinﬂammatory processes in the skin ( Thorslund et al., 2013 ).Identiﬁcation of oxidized LMs in human psoriatic andhealthy skinConsidering the observed differences in omega-3/6 PUFAmetabolism in psoriasis plasma compared with that ofhealthy volunteers, we hypothesized that psoriatic skin le-
sions and psoriatic nonlesional skin would have altered LMproﬁles. Identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of the reportedmediators were done as free and total (sum of free andesteriﬁed) forms, as described in the Materials and Methodssection ( Figure 3 ).The most abundant oxylipins detected in the skin ofpsoriasis patients were monohydroxy derivatives from AA(5-, 8-, 9-, 11-, 12-, and 15-HETE) and LA (9- and 13-HODE)(see Supplementary Tables S3 and S4online). All of theselipoxygenase products were abundant in lesional psoriasisskin, with distinct changes related to 8-HETE, 12-HETE, and15-HETE monohydroxy fatty acids. Free 15-HETE levelswere signiﬁcantly higher in lesional skin compared with thatof healthy participants (31.1 ng/g vs. 3.1 ng/g, respectively;P¼0.02) but relatively lower compared with nonlesionalskin (31.1 ng/g vs. 71.7 ng/g, respectively; P¼0.34). In
contrast, free 8- and 12-HETE levels were much higherin lesional psoriasis skin compared with healthy skin (395.0ng/g vs. 3.1 ng/g, respectively; P¼0.004). Among measuredoxylipins, differences in prostaglandins were related only toTXB2, the free form of which had higher levels in nonle-sional skin of psoriasis participants compared with lesionalskin (3.5 ng/g vs. 1.5 ng/g, respectively; P¼0.01) (seeSupplementary Tables S3 and S4). Furthermore, a differentpattern of changes was observed in relation to epoxideeicosatrienoic acid (EET) metabolites of AA. Total 5,6-EETlevels were nonsigniﬁcantly higher in lesional psoriasisskin compared with nonlesional and healthy skin (seeSupplementary Table S4 ). Another proinﬂammatoryoxidized product of 5-HETE, 5-oxoETE, has been identiﬁedonly in the total form, with slightly higher presence inlesional psoriasis skin.AV Sorokin et al.Lipid Mediators in Psoriasiswww.jidonline.org 1519
LA-derived lipid autacoids were represented by severalOXLAMs with proinﬂammatory effects. Signiﬁcant accumu-lation of both the free and total forms of LA-derived HODEswas observed in lesional psoriasis skin (see SupplementaryTables S3 and S4). Speciﬁcally, 13-HODE levels were 2-fold higher than 9-HODE levels in the lesional skin and113-fold higher compared with the free form in healthy skin(607.9 ng/g vs. 5.4 ng/g, respectively; P¼0.001) (seeSupplementary Table S3 ). The speciﬁed mediators alsodiffered between nonlesional and healthy skin. Epoxide anddihydroxy products of LA were represented by 9,10- and12,13-epoxyoctadecamonoenoic acid and 9,10- and 12,13-dihydroxyoctadecenoate (i.e., DiHOME), the free and totalforms of which were increased in both lesional and nonle-sional skin. Oxidized forms of 9- and 13-HODE and 9- and13-oxooctadecadienoic acid differed in the same pattern.(seeSupplementary Table S3 ).Omega-3 fatty acid metabolomes represented 34.9%
Omega-3 fatty acid metabolomes represented 34.9%of the completed LM proﬁle and included analytes derivedfroma-LA, DHA, and EPA. Free 9-hydroxyoctadecatrienoicacid had an increased trend in psoriasis skin, whereas13-hydroxyoctadecatrienoic acid did not differ signiﬁcantlybetween the analyzed groups (see Supplementary Tables S3and S4). The DHA pathway marker levels, such as 7-, 14-,17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (HDHA), were higher inpsoriasis lesional skin compared with nonlesional andhealthy skin, with predominant accumulation of total14-HDHA (40.8 ng/g vs. 5.4 ng/g, P¼0.03) (seeSupplementary Table S4 ). We found a higher detection rate
of epoxydocosapentaenoic acid isomers, such as totalforms of 16,17-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid and 19,20-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid, accumulated in psoriasisskin. The EPA-derived epoxide isomers, 14,15-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 17,18- epoxyeicosate-traenoic acid, were mostly undetectable among all thegroups (see Supplementary Tables S3 andS4).Identiﬁcation of oxylipins in psoriatic and healthy serumNext, we investigated whether LMs identiﬁed in serum arerepresentative of oxidized markers detected in psoriasis skinand plasma. In general, most of the omega-3/6PUFAederived metabolites found in the skin were also pre-sent in serum. However, unlike skin, LM concentrations weresigniﬁcantly different between psoriasis patients and corre-sponding healthy volunteers (see Supplementary Table S5
online). For example, oxidized AA hydroxy fatty acids, suchas 11-, 12-, 15-HETE, were among the only LMs that changedsigniﬁcantly; however, these LMs were elevated in serum ofhealthy volunteers compared with psoriasis patients. Addi-tionally, we identiﬁed the DHA-derived pro-resolving LMFigure 1. Heatmap of plasma biochemicals identiﬁed in psoriasis patients.

RvD2 (resolvin) in half of the psoriasis and healthy in-dividuals. Overall, differences in each identiﬁed metaboliteamong groups were less signiﬁcant in peripheral blood thanreported for skin biospecimens, indicating that serum alone isnot a reliable biomarker for the skin LM proﬁle.DISCUSSIONPsoriasis is a complex immune-mediated inﬂammatorydisease. By applying targeted LM metabololipidomics, weidentiﬁed a psoriasis-associated metabolomic proﬁle withelevated levels of oxidized derivatives from LA and AA inpsoriasis lesional skin and peripheral blood.Skin changesThe omega-6 metabolome included LA- and AA-derivedmetabolites, which play an essential role in the epidermalbarrier protective function ( McCusker and Grant-Kels,2010 ).

reported to be highly concentrated in healthy skin ( Zibohet al., 2000 ) and elevated in inﬂamed tissue samples ( Wuet al., 2012 ). Speciﬁcally, these omega-6 PUFAs aremetabolized by lipoxygenases (LOXs) 5-LOX, 12-LOX, and15-LOX to generate hydroxy fatty acids such as 9- and13-HODE, which were signiﬁcantly elevated in psoriasislesional skin and plasma, with a higher ratio of 13-HODE infree forms compared with the total pool ( Figure 4 ). Theseoxidized LMs have heterogeneo us biological effects in theskin epidermis. In particular, 13-HODE is considered to beanti-inﬂammatory ( Miller and Ziboh, 1990 ) and maintainsnormal keratinocyte proliferation ( Ogawa et al., 2011 ),whereas 9-HODE facilitates the release of different inﬂam-matory cytokines ( H a t t o r ie ta l . ,2 0 0 8 ) and exhibitspro-atherogenic properties ( Jira et al., 1998 ). Presumably,
the amount of 13-HODE generated by the rapidly prolifer-ating psoriatic epidermis is insufﬁcient to suppress thehyperproliferation of psoriatic lesions. Moreover, oxidizedforms of these LMs, 9- and 13-oxooctadecadienoic acid,were signiﬁcantly elevated in psoriasis skin with the samepredominant presence of 13-oxooctadecadienoic acid.Accumulation of AA pathway markers in lesional psoriasisskin is also in concordance with previous studies that re-ported different distributions of lipoxygenase products. Spe-ciﬁcally, 12-HETE and 15-HETE are differently presented inskin layers, and this interaction might be compromisedbecause of inﬂammation ( Krieg and Furstenberger, 2014 ). 12-HETE is a potent chemoattractant with pro-inﬂammatoryfunction ( Camp et al., 1988 ), whereas 15-HETE can reduceinﬂammatory cell inﬁltration ( Kragballe et al., 1986 ). Normal
epidermis has a very active 12-LOX, which might explain thehigh presence of this mediator in lesional psoriasis skin aswell ( Dowd et al., 1987 ). The source of 15-HETE in psoriasisskin is not only from epidermis and inﬁltrating neutrophils, asfor 12-HETE, but also from dermis. Dermis from nonlesionalpsoriasis skin produces less 15-HETE than normal dermisin vitro ( Kragballe et al., 1986 ). Lesional skin from our pso-riasis cohort was abundant in both monohydroxy fatty acids,with higher presence of 12-HETE. Prostaglandins, lipoxins,and leukotrienes previously reported in human skin ( Kendallet al., 2015 ) were below the limit of quantitation based onour LC-MS/MS methods.Further oxidation of LA and AA metabolites results inproduction of corresponding epoxide forms, such asLA-derived epoxyoctadecamonoenoic acid and EET from AA.Although the roles of these oxidized lipids in skin are
incompletely understood, there are some reports showingtheir relevance to inﬂammatory responses ( Spector et al.,2004 ). Epoxides of EET and keto acid of 5-HETE were pre-sent in all the investigated groups skin and serum, with ahigher concentration of total form epoxides in lesional pso-riasis skin. It has been shown that in the endothelium, EETsinhibit the cytokine-induced inﬂammatory response, increaseCa2þuptake, and affect PGE2 production ( Spector et al.,2004 ). Thus, the accumulation of total 5,6-EET in lesionalskin may suggest a protective role in local skin inﬂammation.There is insufﬁcient information about the levels of 5-oxo-ETEin body ﬂuids or tissues, but some studies have suggestedthat this metabolite could possibly promote neutrophilinﬁltration and inﬂammation ( Grant et al., 2009 ).The omega-3 metabolome in psoriasis patients predomi-nantly included DHA oxidized products, such as 14-HDHA
and 17-HDHA. It is known that 17-HDHA is a pathwaymarker and precursor to D-series resolvins and protectins,which are involved in the resolution of inﬂammation andmodulate innate and adaptive immunity ( Chiurchiu et al.,2016; Serhan and Petasis, 2011 ). We did not measure acomplete EPA anda-LA bioactive metabolome because ofprevious studies and unpublished data that suggested onlyminimal involvement of EPA and
2016; Serhan and Petasis, 2011 ). We did not measure acomplete EPA anda-LA bioactive metabolome because ofprevious studies and unpublished data that suggested onlyminimal involvement of EPA anda-LA autacoid derivatives inhealthy and inﬂamed skin biology ( Kendall et al., 2015 ).These observations suggest that DHA-derived specializedpro-resolving mediators may play a role in psoriasis pathol-ogy. However, studies investigating the full DHA metab-olome are warranted.Blood changesCirculating LA and HODE are esteriﬁed in cholesterol ester,triacylglycerol, and phospholipid components of lipopro-teins, the main transportation of which in circulation isconducted through low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (Lrp1) andscavenger receptors ( Jira et al., 1998 ). It is well known that
the core of the LDL particle represents an assembly of LAesters of cholesterol, embedded in a monomolecular layer ofphospholipids and a protein (apoB), with oxidized LDL ex-pected to consist of OXLAMs ( Spiteller, 1998 ). Althoughstudies investigating oxidized lipids in psoriasis patients arescarce, oxidized LDL has been shown to accumulate inpsoriasis lesional skin ( Tekin et al., 2007 ), along with Lrp1and apoB protein level increases ( Swindell et al., 2015 ).However, diet supplementation with the intermediary long-chain omega-3 docosapentaenoic acid and EPA reverseaccumulation of 9- and 13-HODE and its oxidized products(Markworth et al., 2016 ), which could be a potential treat-ment strategy in the future.The transportation and metabolism of these omega-6/3long-chain PUFAs are generally regulated by adequatelipolysis rate and efﬁcientb-oxidation that can be altered inspeciﬁc disease states. Thus, markers of this system dysre-
gulation, including glycerol, acylcarnitine, and bile acidderivatives, can be found during diseases with inﬂammatoryand metabolic origins ( Fujieda et al., 2013; Schoonemanet al., 2013 ). It is well known that secreted phospholipaseA2catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycerophospholipids at the sn-2 position, releasing glycerol and free fatty acids with arelated protein expression increase in psoriasis lesional skin(Swindell et al., 2015 ). In humans, higher acylcarnitine efﬂuxfrom cells to blood is determined by impaired conjugation offree fatty acids with carnitine, which is necessary for transportof these lipids into the mitochondrial matrix for subsequentb-oxidation ( Schooneman et al., 2013 ). We found elevations in
circulating glycerol and acylcarnitine concentrations associ-ated with psoriasis, which might be explained by higher freefatty acid release from cell storage and its impaired oxidation.Dysfunction of the antioxidant system has been alsoconﬁrmed by our observation that key intracellular antioxi-dant markers (glutathione andg-glutamyl) were decreased inpsoriasis plasma. Subsequent deterioration of fatty acidtransportation and its cell bioprocessing was observed inmarkers of bile acid malfunction.

Figure 4. Explanatory outline of oxylipin biosynthesis and its estimated function in psoriasis. Cutaneous fatty acids and bioactive lipid mediators contribute tothe formation and maintenance of the epidermal barrier. These have been implicated in various inﬂammatory skin conditions, including psoriasis.Pathways involving lipid mediators in maintaining normal homeostasis in the skin and alteration in fatty acid composition and metabolism in psoriat ic skin areshown. LA and ALA are the main sources of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, respectively, which in humans are derived from the diet. Thus, dietaryimbalance in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) leads to an alteration in the metabolism of their derivatives, AA, EPA, and DHA. Furthermore, the me tabolismof PUFA is a complex process involving several enzymes of desaturation, elongation, andb-oxidation, resulting in production of respective bioactiveAV Sorokin et al.Lipid Mediators in Psoriasis

primary and secondary bile acids may be a result of multiplefactors, including decreased intestinal reabsorption andreduced hepatic synthesis/conjugation. The observedchanges in cholesterol precursors could be attributed to thereported cholesterol metabolism dysfunction associated withpsoriasis ( Mehta et al., 2012 ).Besides the mentioned lipid classes, PUFAs can beendogenously converted to addi tional species of bioactivederivatives, as shown in section a1anda2.(b) In membrane phospholipids, LA gives rise to AA, which in turn leads to an increase in COX and LOX enzymeproduction of AA-derived eicosanoids and a decrease in EPA/DHA-derived metabolites. This process culminates in class switching of lipid mediators , ﬁnallyleading to an increase in proinﬂammatory cytokines and a decrease in pro-resolution lipid mediators, specialized pro-resolving mediators. As a con sequence,
PPARagene expression is down-regulated, and NF- kbgene expression is up-regulated, manifesting in corresponding protein synthesis. Psoriasis modulateseicosanoid synthesis, which is important in the formation of the lipid mediators that include specialized pro-resolving mediators, resolvins, and lipoxins. Therapidly proliferating psoriasis epidermis generates an excessive amount of ambiguously functioning mediators such as hydroxy fatty acids, proinﬂ ammatory9-HODE and anti-inﬂammatory 13-HODE, which can be taken up by the circulating LDL. Additional uptake of HODEs from the skin, along with circulatingLA, further increases oxidation and formation of oxidized LDL, which promotes atherogenesis. Other potential pathways of interest include those ofsphingolipids and endocannabinoids metabolism, which also are modulated in psoriasis.

lipids, including lysolipid phosphate mediators and endo-cannabinoids ( K e n d a l le ta l . ,2 0 1 5 ). Lysophosphatidic acid,sphingosine-1-phosphate, and several other relatedmolecules constitute a family o f lysolipid p hosphates thatfunction as receptor-active med iators with complex roles incell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and development(Tokumura, 2004 ). Sphingosine-1-phosphate is a pleio-tropic bioactive lipid that is thought to be dysregulated ina variety of disease conditions. It has been reported thatreduced sphingosine-1-phosphate levels, caused byexcessive sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase activity, might beassociated with the keratinocyte hyperproliferationobserved in psoriasis ( Kim et al., 2004; Checa et al., 2015 ).The higher accumulation of certain circulating endo-cannabinoids detected in our psoriasis cohort might exertanti-inﬂammatory effects through acting as endogenous li-gands for the cannabinoid receptors ( Zurier and Burstein,
2016 ). Although the role of the endocannabinoid system inpsoriasis is incompletely understood, it has been shownthat some classes of these lipids can impair keratinocytedifferentiation and induce apoptosis ( Wilkinson andWilliamson, 2007 ).To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst comprehensive LC-MS/MSebased analysis of bioactive lipid autacoids in humanpsoriasis skin and peripheral blood compared with healthyvolunteers. However, we acknowledge that the strikingglobal differences in fatty acids and LMs could be a result ofother factors and remain difﬁcult to interpret further. Thus,studies with larger sample sizes and in vitro experiments arewarranted to provide mechanistic evidence for the observedchanges. We found that a disbalance in oxylipins and anti-oxidants resulted in targeted analytes signiﬁcantly accumu-lating in lesional psoriasis skin. This study shows thatpsoriasis skin and peripheral blood are characterized by theincreased abundance of oxidized LMs derived from omega-6
fatty acids. Of note, distribution of targeted LMs was differentamong skin and blood and did not depend on given systemictreatment. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is thespeciﬁc bioactivity of any given LM in relation to cell andtissue demand. It is known that some classes of LMs aremostly secreted to circulation, whereas other are deposited inthe skin. Thus, quantitation of both free and total lipid moi-eties in tissue and circulation provides comprehensive oxy-lipin signature proﬁles related to psoriasis. Moreover,increased lipolysis andb-oxidation observed in psoriasispatients might be explained by higher skin tissue demand inbioactive LMs to resolve inﬂammation.In conclusion, our collective ﬁndings suggest that locallyproduced and circulating speciﬁc LMs have a role in modu-lating skin inﬂammation. These results identify speciﬁcmetabolic abnormalities associated with psoriasis, whichcould potentially be used to develop targeted approaches.MATERIALS AND METHODS
MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy populationPlasma for the LM identiﬁcation was derived from a consecutivesample of 90 participants: 60 psoriasis patients and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (age range ¼19e72 years) (seeSupplementary Tables S1 andS2). All enrolled participants were partof a National Institutes of Health clinical study (10H-0126 and13H-0065). A diagnosis of psoriasis was conﬁrmed and quantiﬁedby a dermatologist using the Psoriasis Area Severity Index. Corre-sponding healthy volunteers were consecutively recruited from thesame center to undergo the same testing as the psoriasis patients.Skin and serum analysis have been performed on eight psoriasispatients and seven healthy volunteers (age range ¼26e82 years)from the ongoing National Institutes of Health observational studyof psoriasis and cardiometabolic diseases (see SupplementaryMaterials ). All included study participants were not receiving
from the ongoing National Institutes of Health observational studyof psoriasis and cardiometabolic diseases (see SupplementaryMaterials ). All included study participants were not receivingany systemic anti-psoriasis treatments or topical therapy within 2weeks before biopsy. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acidswas also considered in the ﬁnal data interpretation. At baseline, 4-mm punch biopsy samples were obtained under local anesthesiafrom psoriatic acute plaque lesions and unaffected skin. Biopsysites were selected based on active plaques and varied amongstudy participants. However, biopsy samples of unaffected andhealthy skin were predominan tly from buttocks. Financialcompensation was provided to study participants. Study approvalwas granted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Instituteinstitutional review board in keeping with the Declaration ofHelsinki. All study participants submitted written informed con-sent before enrollment.Blood collection
Blood collectionPeripheral blood from the same study-enrolled participants wascollected in either serum separator or EDTA tubes and centrifuged at1,000 gfor 20 minutes. Obtained serum and plasma were immedi-ately stored at e80/C14C until analysis. Different blood fractions havebeen analyzed because the presence of targeted metabolites in thesetwo compartments is unknown.LC-MS/MS ebased lipidomics of psoriatic skin and serumPunch biopsy samples were extrac ted using ice-cold methanol. Aknown amount of internal standard was added to each sample. Toquantify concentrations of LMs i n skin and plasma, lipid extractswere puriﬁed using solid-phase ex traction and quantiﬁed using LC-MS/MS. The mass spectrometer was operated in electrospraynegative ionization us ing scheduled multiple reaction monitoring,
acquiring multiple reaction monitoring data for each analyte withthe retention time window of 90 seconds. The analytes werequantiﬁed using multiple reactio n monitoring. Detailed descrip-tion of the experimental protocol is provided in the SupplementaryMaterials.Metabolomic proﬁling of human psoriatic plasmaSamples were extracted and prepared for analysis using Metabolon’s(Research Triangle Park, NC) standard solvent extraction method.The extracted samples were split into equal parts for analysis on thegas chromatography/mass spectrometry and LC-MS/MS platforms, aspreviously described ( Cheng et al., 2012 ). Identiﬁcation of knownchemical entities was based on comparison with metabolomic li-brary entries of more than 2,000 commercially available puriﬁedstandards. Additional presently unknown entities were identiﬁed byvirtue of their recurrent nature. Detailed description of the experi-mental protocol is provided in the Supplementary Materials.Statistical analysis
Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were done with a single two-tailed unpairedStudent ttest for parametric variables and the Mann-Whitney ttestfor nonparametric variables. The Pearson chi-square test was usedfor categorical variables. For pairwise Metabolon data comparisons,the Welch ttest was applied, along with the false discovery rateAV Sorokin et al.Lipid Mediators in PsoriasisJournal of Investigative Dermatology (2018), Volume 138 1526
(Q-value) adjustment for considering multiple comparisons (seeSupplementary Materials ). Analysis was performed using Stata/IC12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). P-value of 0.05 or less wasconsidered statistically signiﬁcant.ORCIDAlexander V Sorokin: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2291-4888CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors state no conﬂict of interest.
