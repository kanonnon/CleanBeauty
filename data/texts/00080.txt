Review ArticleRole of topical peptides in preventing or treatingaged skinF. Gorouhi and H. I. MaibachDepartment of Dermatology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USAReceived 25 July 2008, Accepted 4 October 2008Keywords: cosmetics, elderly, peptides, percutaneous penetration, proteinsSynopsisAgeing, a basic biological process seen in all livingcreatures, is not preventable. Surgical and topicalmodalities have been invented and substances wereapplied topically to alter the ageing process.Peptides and proteins, frequently used for thispurpose, were categorized into four groups: signalpeptides, enzyme-inhibitor peptides, neurotransmit-ter-inhibitor peptides and carrier peptides. Wecomprehensively review eligible studies -includingcontrolled ex vivo orin vivo efﬁcacy studies on anytopical peptide or protein that has been adminis-tered to treat signs and symptoms of ageing.Re´sume ´Le vieillissement, processus biologique concernant

Thispreponderance of older individuals over youngerones will transform the shape of the age distribu-tion graph into a rectangle rather than thecurrent pyramid observed [1].
current pyramid observed [1].This demographic shift calls for increased effortsto prevent the ageing process and develop safe andeffective drugs for the elderly. In cosmetic dermatol-ogy, experts are exploring better anti-solar,anti-ageing, anti-wrinkle and ﬁrming products.Pharmaceutical companies frequently use peptidesas active ingredients in their creams. Peptides havedifferent effects on the skin especially for cosmeticspurposes, but one important hurdle to use themtopically is their permeability to penetrate skin.Generally, permeation ability depends on differ-ent factors: physicochemical properties of the sub-stance (acid dissociation constant [p Ka], molecularsize, stability, binding afﬁnity, solubility and parti-tion coefﬁcient); the time-scale of permeation;integrity, thickness and components of the skin,cutaneous metabolism; site, area and duration ofapplication; properties of the transdermal deviceand the creation of a local depot at the site of
and the creation of a local depot at the site ofapplication [2, 3]. In summary, it is ideal to havea topical drug with parameters within the below-mentioned listed range:Correspondence: Howard I.

1 Molecular weight less than 500 Da;2 Moderate log of partition coefﬁcient octanol/water between 1 and 3;3 Melting point less than 200 /C176C;4 Reasonable aqueous solubility (>1 mg mL)1);5 No or few polar centres [4, 5].Diffusivity of the molecules in stratum corneumis related to the size and number of hydrogenbonding groups on a molecule, being maximal forsmall non-hydrogen bonding molecules and reach-ing a minimum with about four hydrogen bondinggroups [6].As peptides and proteins contain many amidebonds, (as hydrogen bond donor and acceptorgroups), and because of their large molecular size,they have low diffusivity in skin. Furthermore,as they often charged at physiological pH, theyare intrinsically hydrophilic. Hence, the lipophilicstratum corneum is a signiﬁcant barrier to pene-tration [7].Overall, topical peptides and proteins have been
Overall, topical peptides and proteins have beensuccessfully and widely used. Patch test of puriﬁedprotein derivatives tuberculin protein and morespeciﬁc derivatives like MPB64 have been effec-tively addressed for active tuberculosis diagnosis[8, 9]. Tacrolimus and with lower permeability,pimecrolimus can penetrate through the skin totreat atopic dermatitis patients [10, 11].Frech et al. [12] found a safe and protective vac-cine patch containing heat-labile protein entero-toxin to prevent diarrhoea in travellers to Mexicoand Guatemala. Even topical cyclosporine A withmolecular weight of more than 1200 Da could bedelivered into the skin with delivery enhancingmethods [13].The main barrier for topical drugs is stratumcorneum, the outermost layer of epidermis. Severaltechniques overcome such a barricade. For exam-ple, chemical penetration enhancers might be use-ful for peptide dermal delivery [14].One study [15] addressed usefulness of ionto-
One study [15] addressed usefulness of ionto-phoresis for topical insulin application. Othermechanisms like sonophoresis in liposomal pep-tides [16] and colloidal carrier systems [17] areconsidered helpful in this regard. Carrier peptidescan increase and accelerate the permeation pro-cess. Chen et al. [18] reported that a short syn-thetic peptide (ACSSSPSKHCG) identiﬁed by in vivophage display assay, facilitated efﬁcient transder-mal insulin delivery through intact skin. Althoughtopical use of a peptide has potential to be effec-tive, delivery across skin can be difﬁcult because ofthe ionic nature of such materials. An approach toimproving delivery is the use of fatty acid deriva-tives to increase the lipophilic property of the pep-tide. For example, the palmitoyl derivative of thepolypeptide interferon apenetrates across human
skin ﬁve- to six-fold greater than the simple pep-tide [19] and also, facial skin improvement hasbeen reported after topical pal-KTTKS (palmitoylpentapeptide-4) therapy [20].Many peptides and proteins used for cosmeticindications; glycyl-histidyl-lysine (GHK)-Cu is oneof the most widely utilized for wound healingand anti-ageing indications. Abdulghani et al.[21] revealed its enhanced but insigniﬁcant anti-ageing effects when compared with tretinoin,Vitamin C and melatonin.Palmitoyl KTTKS, the other frequently used pep-tide, was shown to have more signiﬁcant resultsthan placebo and an active comparator [20, 22].Acetyl hexapeptide-3 (Argireline/C210; Centerchem,Barcelona, Spain) had promising results. The depthof wrinkles was reduced more than 30% for Argir-eline/C210vs. 10% for placebo after 30 days [23].All aforementioned peptides as examples cansuggest that these agents may be effective. Notethat in the only published systematic review [24]

Pubmed, embase and Scopus were systematicallysearched from 1974 to June 15, 2008 (Appendix I).Different words have been used to locate anyknown peptides or proteins; ﬁnd all possible topicaltherapies; locate all cosmeceutical-related papersand rule out irrelevant papers. The irrelevant stud-ies were mainly on topical peptide application forskin cancers, inﬂammatory diseases, infectious dis-eases or blistering diseases. They also consideredirrelevant if they used peptides as vaccines. Wescreened all references of relevant articles to ﬁndother eligible resources. In addition, some in vitroand in vivo data were collected from pharmaceuticalcompanies’ websites. The main purpose of thisstudy was to evaluate available evidence on efﬁcacydata of topical peptides and proteins for ageing skinand only controlled trials were included in thisregard.ª2009 The Authors.

Results and discussionSurprisingly, there were scarce data about perme-ation abilities of these topical peptides. Only per-meation coefﬁcients for three widely used topicalcosmeceutical peptides (GHK and c-L-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl-glycine (GSH); [25]) and Melanocytestimulating hormone (MSH) ([26, 27]) and someamino acids [28, 29] as well as some of their Cucomplexes were reported (Table I).Braun et al. [30] reported relative superoxidedismutase content that has been absorbed in theepidermis and dermis after an 8-h penetration. Theratios of total concentration for epidermis and der-mis were 0.009% and 0.010% after 4 h and 0.031%and 0.010% after 8 h respectively. The characteris-tics of included substances are shown in Table II.Eligible in vivo efﬁcacy studies are shown in Table III.We categorized topical peptides and proteins intofour groups:1 Signal peptides,2 enzyme inhibitor peptides,3 neurotransmitter-inhibitor peptides and4 carrier peptides.Signal peptides
Signal peptidesSignal peptides stimulate matrix protein produc-tion in general and collagen synthesis in speciﬁc.They may be accomplished by stimulation andgrowth of different skin cells like human skin ﬁbro-blasts. Signal peptides can also increase elastin,proteoglycan, glycosaminoglycans and ﬁbronectinproliferation. By increasing matrix cell activitiesand consequently collagen production, the skinlooks ﬁrmer and younger.Table I Permeation coefﬁcients ( Kp) of available relevant peptidesPeptidePermeationcoefﬁcient (cm s)1) PeptidePermeationcoefﬁcient (cm s)1)GHK*[1] 1.36 ·10)9Serine /C160[2] 1.00 ·10)8, pH = 5.6GHK-Cu*[1] 1.35 ·10)98.33·10)9, pH = 7.4GSH*[1] 8.63 ·10)10Threonine /C160[2] 3.27 ·10)8, pH = 6.2GSH-Cu*[1] 1.5 ·10)93.61·10)9, pH = 7.4Histidine /C160[2] 4.44 ·10)9, pH = 7.6 Isoleucine /C160[2] 1.44 ·10)8, pH = 6.05.55·10)9, pH = 7.4 3.61 ·10)9, pH = 7.4Histidine-Cu*[3] 2.72 ·10)6± 0.05 ·10)6Leucine /C160[2] 4.44 ·10)9, pH = 6.0

The tripeptide-1 (glycyl- l-histidyl- l-lysine orGHK) is primarily known as carrier peptides. Itmainly helps to stabilize and deliver Cu. Carrierpeptides are discussed later. However, GHK wasoriginally isolated from human plasma in 1973 byPickart and Thaler [31] and its wound repairproperties were observed in 1985 by Maquartet al. [32] In 1999, Maquart et al. concluded thatGHK or its Cu complex functioned as an activatorof tissue remodelling [32]. It is also a signal pep-tide that promotes extra large collagen aggregatesdegradation in scars, regular collagen synthesis innormal skin, elastin, proteoglycans and glycosami-noglycans production, growth rate and migrationof different cell types and anti-inﬂammatory andantioxidant responses [33–37]. In a controlledex vivo study [38], biotinyl-GHK and vehicle wereinvestigated. Biotinyl-GHK but not vehicle solu-tion showed stimulation of collagen IV, lamininproduction and keratinocyte mitosis.
Tripeptide-1 can be also conjugated with pal-mitic acid and form pal-tripeptide-1 (Biopeptide-CL). In vitro and in vivo studies approved thatBiopeptide-CL stimulates collagen and gylcosami-noglycans synthesis [39].Palmitoyl tripeptide-3/5 (Syn/C210-Coll; Pentapharm,Basel, Switzerland) is a synthetic signal peptide.Thrombospondin I is a protein that binds to tissuegrowth factor beta (TGF- b) and makes it biologicallyinactive. Syn/C210-Coll mimics thrombospondin I trip-eptide sequence to activate TGF- b. Therefore, it pro-motes collagen formation via TGF- b(Pentapharm).In a controlled trial, 60 healthy volunteers received2.5% Syn/C210-Coll cream vs. 10% palmitoyl pentapep-tide-3 cream vs. placebo cream twice daily for84 days. Syn/C210-Coll signiﬁcantly decreased averageand maximum relief by )22 and )36lm respec-tively; when compared with pal-pentapeptide-3, itshowed better signiﬁcant results for Ra, Rz and Rtparameters (Pentapharm).Tripeptide-10 Citrulline (Decorinyl
Tripeptide-10 Citrulline (DecorinylTM; Center-chem) is a peptide with ﬁrming effects and mimicsthe sequences of decorin that binds to collagen ﬁbrils.It also regulates ﬁbrillogenesis and controls ﬁbrilgrowth and their uniformity (Centerchem). Puiget al. [40] presented a single-blind parallel groupcontrolled trial comparing 0.01% liposomal Decori-nylTMand placebo creams. Tripeptide-10 induced a54% increase in skin suppleness ( P< 0.001).

This peptide wasapplied onto half-face (periorbital and cheek) of 25healthy subjects twice daily for 4 weeks. Initialskin elasticity and deformation response wereimproved at week 4.Pal-KTTKS (palmitoyl pentapeptide-4), a syn-thetic signal peptide from pro-collagen I fragment,stimulates collagen I, III and VI and also ﬁbronec-tin, elastin and glycosaminoglycan production[38] and has been frequently used as topical anti-ageing or anti-wrinkle agents. In a study [20] on93 Caucasian female volunteers, Pal-KTTKS hadsigniﬁcantly better scores than placebo for expertgrader assessment and subject self-assessment ofage hyperpigmented spots. Osborne et al. [22]showed a robust result for this peptide in reducingbumpy texture and ﬁne wrinkles compared withother baseline and comparators.Aquaporin is an epidermal water channel pep-

One study [41] showed a signiﬁcanttransepidermal water loss (TEWL) decrease in aqu-aporin-treated forearms vs. untreated forearms(4.8 ± 0.4 g m)2h)1vs. 5.4 ± 0.3 g m)2h)1).Pauly et al. [42] evaluated two new syntheticpeptides: acetyl tetrapeptide-9 and -11 ((AcTP1,AcTP2, respectively). In vitro study revealed anincrease in collagen I and lumican synthesis forAcTP1 and stimulation of keratinocyte cell growthand syndecan-1 synthesis for AcTP2. In vivo studyshowed signiﬁcant increase in skin thickness(5.0%) and skin ﬁrmness (Ur/Uf = 7.5%) forAcTP1 cream. AcTP1 was also more effective thanplacebo. AcTP2 had signiﬁcant effect on biome-chanical parameters of the superﬁcial layers of epi-dermis and 5–10% better effect than placebo [42].Growth factors play an important role in revers-
Growth factors play an important role in revers-ing the ageing process on skin caused by extrinsicand intrinsic factors, although main use of growthfactors is in wound healing. Recombinant humangrowth hormone has mitogenic effect on keratino-cytes and ﬁbroblasts [43] and increases insulingrowth factor-1 and sebum production [44]. Cuta-neous wound healing properties were conﬁrmedby two trials on acute wounds [45, 46].Interferon alpha increases the concentration ofdendritic cells and CD1a and HLA-DR positive cells[47, 48]. Ghersetich and Lotti [48] conducted abefore-after study with three different inclusionprotocols: ﬁve individuals aged 18–21 years, ﬁveaged 57–75 years, and ﬁve underwent cycles ofPsoralen + UVA (PUVA) therapy over a year and
Psoralen + UVA (PUVA) therapy over a year andaged 30–45 years. Alpha-interferon cream(2 000 000 IU per day) in carboxymethylcelluloseand glycerin was applied on periauricular areathree times a day for 4 weeks. Counts for cells thatexpressed CD-1 and HLA-DR were signiﬁcant com-pared with baseline only for aged and PUVA-exposed volunteers (5 ± 1.75 vs. 10 ± 4.47 and6 ± 3.18 vs. 16 ± 2.15 for aged group and4 ± 3.47 vs. 10 ± 3.53 and 3 ± 3.12 vs.14 ± 1.75 for PUVA group respectively).Transforming growth factor aand bare growthfactors that reversibly inhibit keratinocytes andleucocytes growth, promote keratinocyte migra-tion, chemotactic for marcrophages and ﬁbroblasts[49–51]. Among major growth factors, transform-ing growth factor (TGF) ahas the highest humankeratinocyte pro-motility activity, reaching nearly80% of the activity in serum [50].Several growth factors and cytokines have been

It was alsothe best trigger for procollagen I deposition whencompared with 2% concentration, Retin-A anduntreated areas [54].Heat shock proteins involve in one of the princi-pal mechanisms of cell defence and protectionfrom stress. Among its family, Hsp70 has protec-tive effects against UV, apoptosis and ischaemiaand recommended for wound healing and anti-ageing uses [55]. Hsp70 can effectively inhibitaggregation and assist in the refolding of dena-tured proteins. It can reduce cellular damage byretaining the damaged proteins in soluble form, aswell as by binding to unfolded or misfolded pro-teins to assist in their proper refolding [55]. Hsp70can be biotechnologically synthesized from yeasts[56]. Studies on both cultured human epidermal
[56]. Studies on both cultured human epidermalcells and ex vivo skin showed that induction oradministration of Hsp70 prior to stress signiﬁ-cantly diminished UV-related morphologicalchanges and sunburn cell number [56–58]. It canalso modulate inﬂammatory cytokine synthesisand reduce UV-induced inﬂammatory responses[59]. Hsp70 was proved to be able to block apop-tosis by inhibiting signalling events upstreamof stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c- JunN-terminal kinase. activation [60, 61]. Ageingalters the ability of cells to express Hsp70 inresponse to stress and any Hsp70 induction orapplication can reverse the process [61–67].Generally, studies [62–68] showed thatalthough aged skin exhibits a normal level ofHsp70 under non-stressful conditions, it fails toproduce the typical protective Hsp70 increase,comparing with younger skin when exposed byUV. To sum up, Hsp70 can act against UV expo-sure especially in aged skin.Keratin is a major protein in the structure of
Keratin is a major protein in the structure ofhair and skin that can be extracted from humanhair or sheep’s wool. Keratin’s topical applicationcan improve hydration and elasticity of the skinand hair. It is commonly used in skin and hairmoisturizers, ﬁrming agents and hair shiners.Barba et al. [69] conducted a randomized trialcomparing 3% keratin peptides with deionizedwater and untreated control in 16 healthyfemales. Keratin peptides were effective on dis-turbed but not undisturbed skin. In another recenttrial [70], signiﬁcant differences were achieved forskin capacitance (especially) and elasticity para-meters with application of the keratin samples.Among all keratin containing creams, a combina-tion of keratin peptide with the internal wool lipidliposomes had a signiﬁcant beneﬁcial effect com-pared with aqueous solution [70].In two consecutive double-blind studies, dalFarra et al.

ageing effects of a synthetic ﬁbronectine-like pep-tide at 0.5% together with a booster molecule at1%. Twelve volunteers applied the cream formulacontaining the active ingredient twice a day onthe back of one hand and the placebo on the otherhand. Evaluations were performed after 1 and 3 h,and after 7 days. Increased smoothness of skinsurface and also lightening effect on the skin werenoticed by volunteers at all time points. Volunteersestimated a 40% improvement on the peptide-treated side 1 h after application. A second studywas performed on the lips and included two groupsof 12 volunteers each. One group applied the creamformula with the active ingredient, and the othergroup applied the placebo. Evaluations were madeat 1 and 3 h. Signiﬁcant increase in smoothness,hydration and repulping effect were mentioned.Enzyme inhibitor peptidesEnzyme inhibitor peptides directly or indirectly

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [72], soy extract and placebocreams were applied to volar forearm of 21 healthywomen. Papillae index was increased more by soyextract than placebo (3.76 vs. 4.56 in arbitraryunits, P< 0.05).

In awithin-patient untreated-controlled study [75],0.2 g sericin gel was compared with untreated sitewith hydroxyproline assay and TEWL measure-ment to evaluate its hydrating effect. For hydroxy-proline assay, Sericin gel was applied on the driedskin of the forearm at the test site. For TEWL, theupper portion of forearm was used as the applica-tion site of sericin gel and lower portion of forearmfor control. Although hydroxyproline content wasslightly promising in all related parameters for ser-icin, no signiﬁcant differences in hydroxyprolinecontent, skin impedance and TEWL contents wereseen when compared with no treatment. Inanother trial by Daithankar et al. [76], silk-protein100 and different ﬁbroin concentrations were
100 and different ﬁbroin concentrations weretested. Five per cent ﬁroin solution had similarTEWL content to 5% silk-protein-100 solution butmore than 1% and 3% ﬁbroin solutions. Signiﬁ-cant drop in impedance was observed for both 5%sericin and 5% ﬁbroin solutions within 1 h. Silkprotein was compared with bovin serum albuminand vehicle and the results conﬁrmed its superior-ity to both serum albumin and vehicle in reducingUV-B induced symptoms in short-term and long-term treatment courses [77].Neurotransmitter inhibitor peptideNeurotransmitter inhibitor peptides inhibit acetyl-choline release at the neuromuscular junction andhave curare-like effect. Seven types (A–G) of botu-linum toxin target peripheral cholinergic neuronswhere they selectively proteolyse synaptosome-associated protein of 25 000 Da (SNAP-25),syntaxin 1 and synaptobrevin, the soluble N-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein recep-
tor (SNARE) proteins responsible for transmitterrelease, to cause neuromuscular paralysis but ofdifferent durations. Type A toxin proteolyticallydegrades the SNAP-25 protein, a type of SNAREprotein. The SNAP-25 protein is required for therelease of neurotransmitters from the axon endings.Botulinum toxin speciﬁcally cleaves these SNAREs,and so prevents neurosecretory vesicles from dock-ing and or fusing with the nerve synapse plasmamembrane and releasing their neurotransmitters.botulinum toxin type A (BXT-A) paralysis lastslonger (4–6 months) among botulinum toxin sub-types, make it a good choice for anti-wrinkle uses.Researchers have found less invasive topicalequivalents of these toxins [78].

/C210) is a synthetic peptide that isespecially marketed as a component of eye careproducts and patterned from the N-terminal end ofthe protein SNAP-25 that inhibits SNARE complexformation and catecholamine release. Inhibition ofnoradrenaline and adrenaline release was alsodemonstrated. This small peptide exhibits the greatadvantage of its insigniﬁcant acute toxicity(2000 mg kg)1) as compared with BTX-A(20 ng kg)1) [23]. Argireline/C210(Centerchem) inhib-its vesicle docking by preventing the ternarySNARE complex formation, which is involved insynaptic vesicle exocytosis [79, 80].Another open label vehicle-controlled trial, 10%acetyl hexapeptide-3 and placebo creams wereapplied twice daily on 10 women and demon-strated a nearly 30% vs. 10% improvement inperiorbital rhytids after 30 days as measured bysilicone replica analysis respectively [23].Pentapeptide-18 (Leuphasyl/C210) mimics the natu-

Thisstudy suggested a synergistic effect betweenLeuphasyl/C210and Argireline/C210(Centerchem).Pentapeptide-3 (Vialox/C210), a synthetic peptidethat is a competitive antagonist at the acetylcho-line receptors, safely blocks the sodium ion releaseat the synaptic membrane on muscles so they can-not contract as frequently. In vitro tests showedmuscle contractions reduced by 71% within 1 minafter treatment and 58% 2 h later. Less frequentmuscle contractions result in shallower lines. After28 days of twice-daily use, wrinkle depth wasreduced 49% (Centerchem).Tripeptide-3 (Syn/C210-Ake) is used as an intensiveanti-wrinkle agent and mimics the effect ofWaglerin 1, a peptide that is found in the venomof the Temple Viper, Tropidolaemus wagleri .Syn/C210-Ake (at a concentration of 0.5 mmol L)1)was able to reduce the frequency of innervatedmuscle cell contractions by 82% ( P< 0.05) after2 h of treatment.

clearly showed a remarkable higher efﬁcacy forall tested parameters. Before-after measurementswere signiﬁcant for Syn/C210-Ake only and not forArgireline/C210. Best results were seen on forehead skinby up to 52% (parameter Rt) (Lipotec, Barcelona,Spain). A high quality randomized controlled trialis needed to conﬁrm these robust results forSyn/C210-Ake.Carrier peptideCarrier peptides belong to a general category thatacts as a facilitator of an important substance’transportation, but their major application is todeliver important trace elements (like Cu and Mn)necessary for wound healing and enzymatic pro-cesses. Recently, several peptides and proteinshave been developed to accelerate and facilitatethe delivery of bioactive molecules into the skin.These peptides and proteins are known as pene-trating peptides or membrane transduction pep-tides and have basic transduction domains in theirstructure [81]. A study [82], demonstrated that
structure [81]. A study [82], demonstrated thatshort arginine-rich intracellular delivery peptidesfacilitate the transport of various proteins into livingcells. Hou et al. [82] also investigate whetherarginine-rich peptide could serve as carriers fortopical and/or transdermal drug delivery andconcluded that protein penetration can be stimu-lated by such peptides even without fusion betweencarrier peptide and the protein. Another example ofmembrane transduction peptides is PEP-1 that canfacilitate the skin penetration of an anti-ageingprotein, ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3) [83, 84].Abdulghani et al. [21] conducted a non-random-ized four-arm active-controlled trial on 20 partici-pants to compare GHK-Cu with topical tretinoin,Vitamin C and melatonin. Ten subjects receivedtretinoin and Vitamin C creams on the extensor
tretinoin and Vitamin C creams on the extensorsurface of their right and left thighs respectivelyand the other ten subjects received GHK-Cu andmelatonin creams to the extensor surface of theirright and left thighs respectively, for 1 month.Tretinoin, Vitamin C, melatonin and GHK-Cuincreased pro-collagen synthesis in 4/10, 5/10, 5/10 and 7/10 of patients respectively. Appa et al.[85] evaluated the efﬁcacy of two cosmetic GHK-Cu containing formulations for skin conditioning.The skin treatment beneﬁts of a GHK-Cu contain-ing liquid foundation and cream concealer wereevaluated over an 8-week period. Signiﬁcantimprovement in all visual evaluations of skincondition was found within ﬁrst 2 weeks for bothproducts. Skin viscoelastic properties signiﬁcantlyimproved.GHK-Cu was tested in a 12-week placebo-
improved.GHK-Cu was tested in a 12-week placebo-controlled study [86] on facial skin of 71 womenwith mild to advanced photodamage. By week 1,the active cream delivered signiﬁcant improvementin skin laxity, clarity and overall appearance whencompared with placebo. Signiﬁcant improvementin ﬁne lines was noted at week 2 and in wrinklesat week 4 over placebo. Signiﬁcantly improvedviscoelastic properties were consistent withultrasound increase in overall skin density andthickness. Subjects indicated strong cream’sperformance acceptability. There were no adverseobjective or subjective irritation ﬁndings.In a randomized, double blind placebo-controlledstudy [87] that included 67 volunteers, GHK-Cu
study [87] that included 67 volunteers, GHK-Cuvs. placebo were applied twice daily for 12 weekson facial skin. GHK-Cu Improved skin laxity, clar-ity and appearance, reduced ﬁne lines, coarsewrinkles and mottled hyperpigmentation andincreased skin density and thickness. Five includedwomen also applied the cream to one forearm andleave the other forearm as untreated control.GHK-Cu Strongly induced dermal keratinocyteproliferation.The efﬁcacy and safety of GHK-Cu have beeninvestigated in periorbital area of 41 female volun-teers with mild to advanced photodamage. Within4 weeks of this blind and controlled study withVitamin K containing cream as the comparatorgroup, there was signiﬁcant improvement in allparameters, including ﬁne lines, wrinkles and
parameters, including ﬁne lines, wrinkles andoverall appearance of eyelids. The viscoelasticproperties of periorbital skin – which was deter-mined by ballistometer – exhibited statisticallysigniﬁcant improvement by week 1. Increase inoverall skin density and thickness was demon-strated with ultrasound and digital images cap-tured noticeable improvement in appearance ofperiorbital skin [88].ConclusionsTaken together, some peptides have notable effectson chronologically aged and/or photo-damagedskin. There is a large gap for permeability coefﬁ-cient of major cosmeceutical peptides and proteinsand researchers should focus on this ambiguity toﬁnd more efﬁcient substances with better perme-ability.
