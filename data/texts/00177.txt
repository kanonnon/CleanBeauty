Measuring 30–100 nm in diameter and derived from various celltypes, exosomes play a crucial role in intercellular communication by transferring proteins, lipids, andRNA between cells. This review analyzes existing literature on the clinical applications of exosomes.
We conducted a comprehensive search of peer-reviewed articles and clinical trial data to evaluate thebenefits, limitations, and challenges of exosome-based therapies. Key areas of focus included regener-ative medicine, cancer therapy, gene therapy, and diagnostic biomarkers. This review highlights thevast clinical applications of exosomes. In regenerative medicine, exosomes facilitate tissue repair andregeneration. In cancer therapy, exosomes can deliver therapeutic agents directly to tumor cells. Ingene therapy, exosomes serve as vectors for gene delivery. As diagnostic biomarkers, they are usefulin diagnosing various diseases. Challenges such as the isolation, purification, and characterizationof exosomes were identified. Current clinical trials demonstrate the potential of exosome-basedtherapies, though they also reveal significant hurdles. Regulatory issues, including the need for
standardization and validation of exosome products, are critical for advancing these therapies. Whilesignificant progress has been made in understanding exosome biology, further research is essential tofully unlock their clinical potential. Addressing challenges in isolation, purification, and regulatorystandardization is crucial for their successful application in clinical practice. This review provides aconcise overview of the clinical applications of exosomes, emphasizing both their therapeutic promiseand the obstacles that need to be overcome.Keywords: exosomes; therapeutic potential; regenerative medicine; cancer therapy; diagnostic biomarkers1.

Recent Derivatives from Humans and PlantsExosomes serve as vital messengers within the dermis, significantly influencing thebehavior of fibroblasts, the cells primarily responsible for producing collagen and elastin.These proteins are essential for maintaining skin elasticity and strength. Exosomes facilitatecommunication between skin cells and fibroblasts, enhancing collagen and elastin synthe-sis, and increasing dermal fat, thereby promoting the skin’s regenerative and restorativecapacities for anti-aging. This leads to improved skin texture and a reduction in wrinklesand fine lines. Additionally, exosomes contribute to elastin production, which is crucial formaintaining a youthful and firm skin appearance [58].At the molecular level, exosomes exert their rejuvenating effects through variouspathways and growth factors, notably TGF-B. TGF-B plays a critical role in skin repair and
rejuvenation by influencing cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Exosomes carryand deliver TGF-B to target cells in the skin, triggering specific signaling cascades thatimprove skin structure and function.Furthermore, exosomes are involved in the modulation of the extracellular matrix(ECM), a complex network of proteins and other molecules that provide structural andbiochemical support to surrounding cells. They assist in remodeling this matrix, which isparticularly important in wound healing and the prevention of scar formation.Recently, there has been a growing focus on exosomes derived from the humanpharynx (EXOP , Sihler Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea and Exodew, Hyundaimeditech Inc.,Seoul, Republic of Korea) (Figure 4). Stem cells collected through swab-based samplingduring examinations, such as influenza screenings in early childhood, are known for theirexceptional differentiation capabilities (Figure 5) [59].

Exosomes were isolated using centrifugation with a sucrose gradient, and their prop-erties were analyzed th rough dynamic light sca ttering, zeta potential measurements, and transmission electron microscopy. Bone  marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were used to assess the cytotoxici ty of exosomes and their ability to inhibit osteoclast di ﬀeren-tiation. The results demonstrated that exos omes maintained high BMM viability and pro-liferation while inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. At concentrations greater than 1 µg/mL, the exosomes signi ﬁcantly impeded osteoclast di ﬀerentiation, as con ﬁrmed by tartrate-re-sistant acid phosphatase and F-actin staining. Exosomes also suppressed the RANKL-induced signaling pathways, including I κBα, c-JUN N-terminal kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, as well as the genes regulating osteoclast maturation. The exosomes were rich in Rb1 and Rg1 ginsenosides,
and were more e ﬀective at inhibiting osteoclast di ﬀerentiation than these ginsenosides alone or in combination. Additionally, the unique properties of exos omes can be applied in esthetics. Their anti-in ﬂammatory and immunostimulant e ﬀects could be bene ﬁcial for skin health, po-tentially aiding in the treatment of in ﬂammatory skin conditions and enhancing skin re-juvenation.

They hold significant promise for biomedical and cosmeticapplications, particularly from medicinal crops like ginseng. However, isolating stableexosomes with high purity remains a major challenge.This study tested three methods to isolate exosomes from ginseng: ultracentrifugation(the most widely used method), the ExoQuick system (a polymer-based exosome precipita-tion approach), and a combination of both methods. Size distribution analysis showed thatthe purity of exosome isolation was 34.1% with ultracentrifugation, 59.7% with ExoQuick,and significantly improved to 83.3% with the combination method.The combination method not only enhanced exosome isolation purity, but also in-creased the colloidal stability of the isolated ginseng exosomes, almost doubling the stability
achieved by ultracentrifugation alone. Additionally, this method was effective in isolatinghigh-purity and high-stability exosomes from the model plant Arabidopsis.Overall, these findings indicate that the combination method is highly suitable forisolating high-purity and high-stability exosomes from plants, including ginseng, makingit a promising approach for both biomedical and cosmetic uses.7.

In addition to the donor source suitability evaluation, the following analysesof the stem cells are made to ensure identification and genetic stability of the source cells.In addition, standardized methods to evaluate the potency and reproducibility of theexosomes based on various criteria are followed to ensure consistent exosome productionwith added quality and consistency.* Identification of cells (chromosomal karyotype analysis, cell surface phenotypic mark-ers, specific gene expression levels, etc.).* Stability (shape, growth characteristics, etc.), genetic stability (karyotype analysis,etc.), microbial test (virus, bacteria, fungus, mycoplasma, etc.).
* Proof of standardization and reproducibility of the exosome production process(density, survival rate, cell properties, subculture method, culturing time carbondioxide concentration, culture temperature, medium additives, medium composition,culture vessel, etc.)* Standardization for isolating and purifying exosome (TFF-exosome isolation).Every step, from sourcing to the isolation of exosomes, must adhere to the highest pro-duction standards to guarantee optimal efficacy. As highlighted by Th éry et al. [ 62], factorssuch as processing and storage significantly impact exosome physiology and, consequently,influence exosome research. ZISHEL BIO’s distinctive all-in-one production pipeline priori-tize efficiency and purity. Notably, the harvesting-to-culturing gap time is minimized toless than 5 min. Such practice allows our team to avoid long time delivery/storage andfreezing and thawing process of the harvested media, minimizing every possible risk of
disturbing the cells. This streamlined approach results in a substantial increase in bothcell and exosome potency and viability. Importantly, this rapid processing occurs withoutintroducing any mutations or stress factors that could compromise the safety and efficacyof the final product.(2) Quality Considerations for the Optimization of Produced ExosomesAfter producing exosomes, standardized guidelines for quality control shall be formu-lated in every possible process.* Various characteristics of exosomes produced through the separation process must beanalyzed (analyzing the profiles of exosome nano particles, size, protein, mRNA, andlipid).* Qualitative/quantitative testing methods and acceptable limits for impurities mustbe established.* Mycoplasma, viruses, bacteria, fungi, endotoxin.* The quality and stability of extracellular vesicle treatments are tested according to the‘Stability Test Standards for Pharmaceuticals’, etc. (FDA guide).
Although there are still many challenges and uncertainties that need to be addressed,the recent development of standardized methods for isolating and purifying exosomes isled by ZISHEL BIO, a leading biotech company for exosomes R&D based in South Korea.Powered by ZISHEL BIO’s puriMAX Technology, a customized solution for maximizing pu-rity and standardized exosomes, purimaxomes are controlled in-house through validationsfrom screening of harvested cells to culturing and isolation. The MSC-derived cultivatedcells are screened and quality controlled via its proprietary process known as ctrlSourcecodes. The health data and inspections are recorded and made traceable. Purimaxomes’culture and isolation processes are developed and classified under high- and low-endproduction technologies. To increase the overall production capability and consistency ofexosome production, puriMax Technology is built as the innovative double-looped schemeto tackle some of the unmet challenges.
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024 ,25, 7794 18 of 218. Future Insights and Potential PlansThis review of the literature highlights the vast potential of exosomes as therapeuticagents in various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders,and autoimmune disorders. The benefits of exosomes as therapeutic agents are numerous,including their ability to deliver therapeutic cargo, modulate immune responses, andpromote tissue repair. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials demonstrate theefficacy and safety of exosome-based therapies, which have shown promise in treatingvarious diseases.However, there are also several limitations and challenges associated with exosome-based therapies. One of the main challenges is the standardization and validation ofexosome-based products, including issues with scalability, purity, and stability. Addition-ally, the regulatory framework for exosome-based therapies is still evolving, and there is a
need for further research to understand the biological mechanisms underlying exosome-mediated delivery [20].Despite these challenges, there are several promising areas of research that hold greatpotential for the development of exosome-based therapies. For example, the use of mes-enchymal stem cell-derived exosomes shows promise in treating various diseases, includingcardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, and autoimmune disorders. The develop-ment of exosome-based vaccines is another area of research that has shown promisingresults in preclinical studies [14].In addition to these areas of research, there are several other potential applications ofexosomes that warrant further investigation. For example, the use of exosomes in ortho-pedics could potentially treat conditions such as osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and tendoninjuries [ 35,36]. The use of exosomes in lung-regenerative medicine could potentially treat
diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, andlung cancer [36,44,54].Despite the promising results of exosome-based therapies in various diseases, there areseveral challenges and limitations that need to be addressed. One of the main challengesis the standardization and validation of exosome-based products, including issues withscalability, purity, and stability. Additionally, the regulatory framework for exosome-based therapies is still evolving, and there is a need for further research to understand thebiological mechanisms underlying exosome-mediated delivery.Another challenge is the difficulty in tracking the fate of exosomes after administration.Exosomes are small particles that can be taken up by various cells and tissues, making itdifficult to track their fate and determine their efficacy. Additionally, the development ofmethods for tracking the fate of exosomes is essential for understanding their mechanisms
of action and optimizing their therapeutic potential.Several areas of research would be beneficial in advancing our understanding ofexosome-based therapies and their potential applications, such as the following:* Further research is needed to develop methods for standardizing and validatingexosome-based products.* The regulatory framework for exosome-based therapies needs to be further developedand clarified.* The biological mechanisms underlying exosome-mediated delivery need to be fullyunderstood.* The development of methods for tracking the fate of exosomes needs to be advanced.* The use of exosomes in combination with other therapeutic agents needs to be explored.* The development of personalized therapies using patient-derived exosomes needs tobe investigated.In addition to these areas of research, there are several other potential applications ofexosomes that warrant further investigation, as follows:
* The use of exosomes in regenerative medicine could potentially treat a range of

ConclusionsThe clinical applications of exosomes is a rapidly evolving field with significant poten-tial to revolutionize the treatment of various diseases. The data presented in this reviewhighlight the versatility and efficacy of exosomes as a therapeutic agent, with promis-ing results in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurological disorders.The ability of exosomes to deliver targeted therapeutics, evade immune recognition, andpromote tissue repair and regeneration make them an attractive option for clinicians.
However, despite the significant progress that has been made, there are still manychallenges and uncertainties that need to be addressed. The development of standardizedmethods for isolating and purifying exosomes, as well as the optimization of exosomalcargo loading and stability, are critical areas of research that require further attention.Furthermore, the regulatory environment surrounding the use of exosomes as a therapeuticagent is still evolving, and guidelines for their clinical use are needed.Future research directions should focus on addressing these challenges and uncer-tainties. The development of biomarkers for exosomal cargo and the optimization ofexosomal delivery methods are critical areas of research that have the potential to sig-nificantly improve the efficacy and safety of exosome-based therapies. Additionally, theexploration of exosomes as a diagnostic tool for various diseases is an area that warrantsfurther investigation.
