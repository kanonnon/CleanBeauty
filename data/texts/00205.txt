Retinoid-
containing treatments have been used since ~1550BC by the early Egyptians. Treatment of ichthyosi-form disorders with retinoids dates back at least to the 1930s. Early use of high-dose vitamin Ademonstrated efﬁcacy, but because vitamin A is stored in the liver, toxicity limited usefulness. Interestturned to synthetic retinoids in an effort to enhance efﬁcacy and limit toxicity. Acetretin, isotretinoinand, in the past etretinate, have provided the most effective therapy for ichthyosiform conditions. Theyhave been used for a variety of ages, including in newborns with severe ichthyosis and for decades insome patients. Careful surveillance and management of mucous membrane, laboratory, skeletal, andteratogenic side effects has made systemic retinoids the mainstay of therapy for ichthyosis and relatedskin types.KEYWORDS: acitretin, ectropion, ichthyosis, isotretinoin, retinoidIntroductionIchthyoses and related skin types include a broad
Ichthyoses and related skin types include a broadspectrum of conditions which vary in etiology(inherited versus acquired), onset (congenital toadult onset), intensity (mild to severe), and extentof involvement (conﬁned to the skin versus mul-tisystem).

quality and quantity of scale, the process of epid-ermal maturation (differentiation), the quality andquantity of stratum corneum, and the kineticsof keratinocyte proliferation. In most, the barrierfunction of the skin is abnormal.Diagnosis is usually established by characteriza-tion of clinical features, inheritance pattern andassociated ﬁndings. Therapy is usually multidi-mensional including hydration, lubrication andkeratolytic agents that may be topical and sys-temic, and are directed at minimizing local symp-toms or inducing remission.Retinoid therapy has been known since the timeof the ancient Egyptians, and Ebers Papyrus, datedapproximately ~1550BC, discusses the use of ox
liver, which is rich in vitamin A, as a treatment fornight blindness. Vitamin A deﬁciency was relatedto epithelial changes in 1925 by Wolbach and Howe(1) and to cancer in 1926 by Fujimaki (2). Pityriasisrubra pilaris (PRP) is one of the conditions thathelped identify a relationship between retinoidsand the disorders of corniﬁcation, and suggestedthat retinoids could offer a therapeutic option.Long before a molecular basis of retinoid actionwas understood, Grifﬁths (3) wrote about a 1931report by Frazier and Hu (4) ascribing cutaneouschanges to vitamin A deﬁciency in Chinese soldiersfrom Peiping Province. In 1935, Loewenthal (5)noted that similar changes in prisoners in Ugandawere histologically similar to those of PRP andcould be treated with cod liver oil, a rich source ofvitamin A. In 1941, noting similarities in keratoticpapules seen in vitamin A deﬁciency and Darierdisease (DD), Peck, Chargin and Sobotka reasonedthat the dyskeratosis of DD might be related tovitamin A deﬁciency,
of DD might be related tovitamin A deﬁciency, and reported improvementwith large oral doses of vitamin A (6).
Currently, topical and systemic retinoids arewidely used in the treatment of skin disorders andin the treatment and prevention of cancer. Thisarticle will focus on the use of systemic retinoids inthe management of ichthyosis and related skintypes.Management of the disordersof corniﬁcationThe main features of ichthyosis are scaling andoften thickening of the skin, and the main objec-tives of treatment include hydration, lubrication,and removal of thick scales (keratolysis) (7). Evenwhen thick, ichthyotic skin has an abnormalbarrier function and increased transepidermalwater loss. Humidiﬁcation with long baths canhydrate and facilitate scale removal by abrasives
such as sponges, etc. Lubrication with bath oils orafter bathing to wet skin helps prolong skinhydration and ﬂexibility. Lubricating agents varyand include lotions, creams, oils and ointments.Humidiﬁcation of environments is also beneﬁcial.Use of keratolytic agents facilitate desquamationand can include urea, salicylic acids and alphahydroxy acids. Sometimes, these are used underocclusion for enhanced effect. Care should betaken in children with agents such as topical sali-cylic acid because of absorption, and in conditionssuch as Netherton syndrome, in which the combi-nation of the abnormal barrier and dermatitis canincrease the absorption of topical medicationssuch as calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, pime-crolimus) and corticosteroids. In disorders withincreased risk of skin infection such as epider-molytic hyperkeratosis, topical and systemic anti-microbials are often required. Topical modalitiesshould not be discontinued when starting systemicretinoid therapy because they may

Considerations in starting systemicretinoid therapy: who, when, which,and howPatient selectionBefore retinoid therapy is considered, it is impor-
tant to thoroughly discuss the expected outcomeand the potential adverse effects with the patientor, in the case of children, both the child andparents. Nearly all patients with ichthyosis getphenotypic improvement on systemic retinoids(Netherton is the main exception). Improvementgenerally occurs within several weeks to a month,but the scaling recurs if the retinoid is stopped.General reduction in the thickness of scale can beexpected. For those who fatigue easily because ofoverheating secondary to absent sweating, sys-temic retinoids may increase the ability to sweat,an important beneﬁt. Retinoids can signiﬁcantlyameliorate ectropion or pseudoainhum. The sideeffects or risks of long-term retinoid use includesthe development of ligamentous calciﬁcations,which occasionally are symptomatic, but are oth-erwise the same as for short-term use; all arereversible except for the teratogenicity and skeletalchanges.

retinoid treatment should be delayed as long aspractical. Age, severity, time spent grooming, psy-chosocial status, and ability to understand/complywith contraception are important considerationsbefore initiating retinoids. A trial on a systemicretinoid to measure efﬁcacy is sometimes usefulin helping the physician and patient balance thebeneﬁt/risk ratio. Retinoids cause a generalizedkeratolytic effect, which can abruptly lead to exten-sive shedding or peeling of scale. In epidermolyticichthyosis (EI), high doses can enhance blistering.A low dosage of retinoid should be prescribed ini-tially, with a gradual increase in dosage until a sat-isfactory beneﬁt is achieved.Choice of retinoidIsotretinoin was initially developed as a syntheticretinoid, but this 13- cisisomer of naturally occur-ring tretinoin ( trans -retinoic acid (RA)) is also
present in cells as a naturally occurring metabolite.Both agents are structurally related to vitamin A.Etretinate (which is no longer available in theUnited States, Canada, and many European coun-tries) is an aromatic retinoid, which is slowly elimi-nated from the body (8). Acitretin is a metabolite ofetretinate and has the advantage that it is notstored in adipose tissue and, therefore, has a half-life of 2 days in humans. Etretinate is about 50times more lipophilic than acitretin, and has alonger half-life (which can be as long as 120 days).Etretinate has been detected in the blood for up to2 years after discontinuation of therapy. Acitretinoften becomes undetectable after 3–4 weeks;however, it also has the potential for body storageand longer persistence. One of the greatest effectsof either retinoid is the decrease in scaling andreduction of hyperkeratosis.Responses and risks of isotretinoin and acitretin
Responses and risks of isotretinoin and acitretinas treatments for ichthyosis are generally similar.Some patients think results with one are better thanthe other, but no consistent preference is clear. Aci-tretin, similar to its predecessor etretinate, has agreater capacity to cause peeling of the palms andsoles compared with isotretinoin. A major advan-tage to long-term use of isotretinoin is its shorthalf-life, simplifying dose changes, “drug holidays”and family planning. While isotretinoin is clearedwithin several months, acitretin has the potential topersist in the body because of conversion to etreti-nate, particularly when taken with ethanol. There-fore pregnancy should be avoided for 3 yearsfollowing acitretin therapy (9). All currently avail-able retinoids are teratogens, and require thoroughdiscussion of this issue prior to and, repeatedly,during therapy. While perfect contraceptive mea-
sures are desirable, the possibility of an unintendedpregnancy should be discussed. A US Food andDrug Administration (FDA)–mandated registry(iPLEDGE) is now in place for all individualsprescribing, dispensing, or taking isotretinoin. Thisregistry aims to further the public health goal toeliminate fetal exposure to isotretinoin.Dose and durationThe goal of choosing a dose should be to ﬁnd the
The goal of choosing a dose should be to ﬁnd thelowest dose that the patient ﬁnds acceptable.Few require more than 1 mg/kg of isotretinoin or0.5 mg/kg of acitretin. Many patients ﬁnd that con-siderably lower doses make a substantial differencein the way they look, feel, and in the time neededfor grooming. Some patients even take “retinoidholidays” during the more humid summer months.For patients with DD and EI, frequent adjustmentsof dose are common because for them the thera-peutic window is narrow. Reports of long-term safeuse of retinoid therapy have been published, andwe have had patients who have taken systemic ret-inoids safely for decades (10–12). However, mostpatients on long-term oral retinoids will developdiffuse skeletal hyperostosis, which will be asymp-tomatic in some, but cause signiﬁcant backstiffness and/or hyperostoses in others (13).ToxicityTherapy with systemic retinoids is associated with
ToxicityTherapy with systemic retinoids is associated withboth acute and chronic toxicities. Mucocutanoustoxcities of cheilitis, xerosis, dry nose, and eye irri-tation are common. Hair loss is more commonand severe with acitretin compared with isotret-inon, but is reversible after discontinuation oftherapy. Alteration in hair texture, with develop-ment of curly hair has rarely been reported andmay not be reversible. Laboratory abnormalitiesmay be observed in blood cell counts, chemistries,and lipids.Chronic toxicities mainly affect the skeletalsystem with an enthesopathy similar to diffuseidiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. This is manifestedas hyperostoses or spurs along the spine (usuallyanterior spinal ligament) and at tendon and liga-mentous insertions around joints (tendon andligament calciﬁcation) (13).Laboratory monitoringBefore initiating oral retinoid therapy laboratorytests should be obtained, including a baselineDiGiovanna et al.28
complete blood count, chemistry panel, whichincludes liver function tests, fasting triglycerideand cholesterol levels, and for women of child-bearing potential human chorionic gonadotropin(HCG). Frequency of follow-up depends on previ-ous ﬁndings. HCG in women of child-bearingpotential is repeated monthly. Other labs arerechecked at periodic intervals. During long-termtherapy, even when results are normal, most prac-titioners repeat labs every 3–12 months.As soon as the patient decides that long-term
As soon as the patient decides that long-termtherapy is well tolerated and will be desirable, aseries of baseline radiographs are usually obtained.This usually includes lateral cervical, thoracic, andsometimes lumbar spine, and may include the hipsand lateral view of the calcanei of the feet, commonareas of involvement with hyperostoses. Baselinebone density scan can also be performed at thistime to determine the status of bone density. Fre-quency of follow-up depends on previous ﬁndings.If asymptomatic during the ﬁrst few years we oftenrepeat X-rays and bone density at 1–3-year inter-vals. If there are no changes or symptoms, somepractitioners subsequently repeat imaging lessfrequently. Because extra-osseous calciﬁcation isassociated with retinoid treatment, bone densitymeasurements must be interpreted with caution.Mechanisms of retinoid action
Retinoids act as ligands for nuclear transcriptionfactors that control gene expression (14,15). Retin-oids bind to different combinations of retinoidreceptors, RA receptors and retinoid X receptors(RXRs) that typically act as either hetero- orhomodimers. Each of these has three different iso-types (alpha, beta, gamma). Upon RA binding, theligand-receptor complex enters the nucleus andbinds to speciﬁc DNA-binding elements presentin promoters of genes. A number of co-regulatoryproteins are recruited to the DNA-bindingcomplex. The levels of these co-regulators arecrucial for nuclear receptor-mediated transcrip-tion and many co-regulators have been demon-strated to be targets for diverse intracellularsignaling pathways and post-translational modiﬁ-cations. Additionally, retinoid effects can also bemediated by direct interactions between the recep-tor and other cellular proteins, independent fromDNA-binding. Through different combinations ofthese regulatory mechanisms, retinoids are able
ofthese regulatory mechanisms, retinoids are able tomodulate keratinocyte function (16), explainingwhy different retinoids can exert differential effects.
Regulatory elements within the promoterregions of target genes assure speciﬁcity by con-taining highly conserved repeats of sequencesrelated to AGGTCA. Differentially spaced half-siteDNA elements produce distinct transcriptionalresponses. The DNA-binding domains of thereceptors undergo conformational changes whenbinding to the response elements; i.e., the recep-tors adopt different conformations at differentbinding sites. Ultimately, nuclear receptor bindingresults in the transcription of messenger RNA ofdownstream genes that subsequently becometranslated into a respective protein to produce aphysiological response.Retinoids were used to treat ichthyosis long
Retinoids were used to treat ichthyosis longbefore their actions on gene transcription wereappreciated. Unfortunately, direct studies of howthey work in ichthyosis are lacking. Retinoidactions on keratinocyte protein expression (17)predict that their effects will be complex and maybe different in normal skin, diseased skin, andtissue culture models. Several retinoid effectssurely have relevance to ichthyosis: they thin thestratum corneum (18,19), facilitate desquamation(20) through down-regulation of protein compo-nents of corneodesmosomes (17,21) and they haveanti-inﬂammatory properties (22,23).RA metabolism blockingagents (RAMBAs)In addition to modulation by exogenous adminis-
RA metabolism blockingagents (RAMBAs)In addition to modulation by exogenous adminis-tration of RA, keratinocyte differentiation can beaffected by alterations in the intracellular concen-trations of RA (16). RA can be synthesized fromretinol taken up from the circulation (24). In theperipheral blood, the availability of retinol is regu-lated by retinol-binding protein (RBP). STRA6(stimulated by RA) protein is a membrane receptor,mediating retinol uptake into cells. Cellular retinolbinding proteins (CRBPs I and II) bind intracellularretinol. Intracellular retinoid concentrations arecontrolled by: (i) dehydrogenases involved in RAsynthesis (RalDH2, RoDH-4), (ii) lecithin : retinolacyl transferase, acyl CoA : retinol acyl transferase,and GS2 (25–27), which mediate esteriﬁcationwith long-chain fatty acids, and (iii) CYP26, whichdegrades RA.CYP26 inhibitors, also termed RAMBAs can alter
CYP26 inhibitors, also termed RAMBAs can alterintracellular RA concentrations. CYP26 inhibitionrepresents an alternative way of increasing retinoidbioavailability within the epidermis (27). WhileRAMBA inhibition has similar effects on the epider-mis as RA administration itself (28), the hope isthat modulating RA metabolism rather than exog-enously adding RA to the organism limits adverseManagement of ichthyoses and related skin types29
effects. RAMBAs preferential exert their effects inspeciﬁc target tissues (e.g., the epidermis) and theyare quickly eliminated after treatment has beenstopped. Retinoid-independent effects may alsocontribute to an improved beneﬁt/risk ratio ofRAMBA over the exogenous administration of RA.The ﬁrst RAMBA was the antifungal ketocona-zole. The imidazol derivative, liarozole, which lacksantifungal activity, has received orphan drug statusfor congenital ichthyosis from the European Com-mission and from the US FDA. RAMBAs are notcurrently approved in the United States.Disease speciﬁc considerationsIchthyosesAutosomal-recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI).
Autosomal-recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI).The clinical presentation and severity of ARCImay vary signiﬁcantly, ranging from harlequin ich-thyosis (HI), the most severe, to lamellar ichthyosis(LI), and then to nonbullous congenital ichth-yosiform erythroderma (CIE). While the clinicalhallmark of ARCI is epidermal scaling, patientsmay also have a collodion membrane at birth,ectropion, eclabium, alopecia, palmoplantar kera-toderma (PPK), hypohidrosis, and/or variableerythema. Patients with LI have large, dark, plate-like cutaneous scales with minimal erythema,while patients with CIE have erythroderma withoverlying ﬁne white scales. LI and CIE both havetheir own clinical spectrum within ARCI. Causativemutations have been identiﬁed in eight genes:TGM1 ,ALOX12B ,ALOXE3 ,ABCA12 ,NIPAL4(ichthyin), CYP4F22 and LIP. Mutations in TGM1account for 50–60% of all ARCI and most patientswith LI. ABCA12 is the major gene causing HI and
has also been described in some LI patients. Muta-tions in ALOXE3 , ALOX12 , NIPAL4 and PNPLA1 arepresent in CIE or intermediate LI/NCIE pheno-types (29–32).Retinoids have been reported efﬁcacious in thetreatment of ARCI based on case reports and series(5–11,33–38). In many patients, marked improve-ment or remission has been reported as long asthe drug is continued, which for many patientshas spanned decades (Fig. 1a–c). The mechanismof retinoid action in ARCI likely involves modu-lation of keratinocyte differentiation, keratino-cyte hyperproliferation, and tissue inﬁltration byinﬂammatory cells. Systemic retinoids used in theCDA BFIG. 1. (A) A patient with autosomal-recessive congenital ichthyosis-lamellar ichthyosis type before treatment with oral retin-oid therapy.

treatment of ARCI include isotretinoin, acitretin,and etretinate.Acitretin therapy markedly improves mostpatients with LI/CIE. The optimal dose variesconsiderable among individuals, but responsesusually fall into high and low dose proﬁles (38).Most patients with classical manifestations of LIimprove markedly, and the remaining patientsshow mild to moderate improvement. Somepatients improve after a gradual incrementalincrease in dosage ( /H1135035 mg/day). In these patientsthe maximum dose is limited by mucocutaneousside effects (cheilitis, epistaxis, or hair loss). Otherpatients, including those with the erythrodermicvariant, notice marked deterioration in their skincondition with dosages /H1135035 mg/day, but improve
with low-dose acitretin treatment (10–25 mg/day)(38). Cosmetically acceptable hair re-growth hasbeen described in a patient with severe alopeciaafter 4 years of oral retinoid therapy (38). Aromaticretinoids (acetretin, etretinate) have a more pro-nounced response on volar skin in the treatmentof palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, with greater shed-ding of thick palms and soles. While acitretin(0.5–1 mg/kg/day) is more commonly used thanisotretinoin, isotretinoin has a shorter half-life and,therefore, poses a lower teratogenic risk for femalesof child-bearing potential.In ARCI, skin thickness and scaling decrease
with retinoid therapy beginning about 1–2 weeksafter the initiation of therapy. Thickening recursafter the retinoid is discontinued (Fig. 1d). Com-pared with LI, some patients with CIE may respondmore completely and at lower doses. Since the sys-temic retinoid therapy is likely to be used long-term, it is wise to keep the dose as low as ispractical, to employ retinoid-free periods (retinoidholidays) and to encourage the use of topicaltherapy to reduce the dose of retinoid required.While blepharitis and conjunctivitis are well-known retinoid side effects, these drugs are usuallywell tolerated by patients with ectropion (34).Systemic retinoids have the ability to decrease thetendency for ectropion to progress. Patients withectropion should pay careful attention to eye care,with artiﬁcial tears and eye lubricants, since lackof eye lubrication can lead keratitis, and regularophthalmology evaluation is recommended (seeComplications of Ichthyosis Beyond the Skin). Theretraction of the lids
Beyond the Skin). Theretraction of the lids is a concern at night whenfailure of the lids to close during sleep can lead toexposure keratitis. Topical ophthalmic ointmentsat bedtime can minimize problems.
Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 26, therate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of RA, havebeen developed as RAMBAs. Liarozole and ramba-zole, have been studied in the treatment of ARCI(39–42). A large-scale multicenter Phase II/III trialin LI evaluated oral liarozole (75 mg and 150 mgonce daily) given during 12 weeks compared withplacebo and showed that liarozole is an effectivetreatment for ichthyosis with results that are atleast comparable to those of acitretin (40). Liaro-zole 5% cream is effective in ARCI and treatmentwas generally well tolerated. Administration ofliarozole 5% cream can elevated plasma concentra-tions in patients with ARCI (41). Orphan drugstatus has been granted for liarozole in bothEurope and the US but Liarozole development hasnow been discontinued.Systemic retinoids during childhood. Systemic ret-
Systemic retinoids during childhood. Systemic ret-
inoids are occasionally used in childhood and inthe newborn period. Perhaps the most importantneonatal usage is for HI. HI is characterized by an“armor” of thick scale plates separated by deep ﬁs-sures, ectropion, and eclabium. The nose and earsare ﬂattened and appear rudimentary. Constrictingbands can surround the extremities and these neo-nates are more prone to sepsis, dehydration, andimpaired thermoregulation. Babies who surviveinto infancy and beyond develop skin changesresembling severe CIE (43). Two recent studieshave reported 83–86% of patients with HI treatedwith an oral retinoid survived (44,45). Among thesurvivors, treatment was started within the ﬁrst 7days of life in 80 and 70% received one course oftreatment and 20% had two separate courses (44).In contrast, 76% of babies who did not receivedretinoids died and 63% died by Day 3. Some ofthese differences may be related to the availabilityof high-quality neonatal intensive care and bysocioeconomic factors, and we are aware
and bysocioeconomic factors, and we are aware of HIinfants who have survived without the use of retin-oids. Controlled clinical trials would clarify thetrue contribution of retinoid administration to HIsurvival.
In HI, topical or systemic retinoids are mostuseful in combating soft-tissue constrictions thatlead to functional impairment. If distal digitsbecome necrotic because of constricting scale,retinoids help relieve those constrictions. It hasbeen postulated that thoracic constriction by thickscales can impede breathing and can be reduced byretinoid therapy. Most patients with HI reportedin the literature have been treated with acitretin(43,45); however, liquid acitretin is not widely avail-able, and may take several days to obtain, therebydelaying treatment. The retinoid dose usuallyranged from 0.5 to 2.5 mg/kg, but has beenManagement of ichthyoses and related skin types31
adjusted according to response, tolerability, andseverity of ichthyosis. Improvement in hyperkera-tosis, ectropion and eclabium, pliability of the skin,limb movements, sucking, and eyelid closing havebeen noted within a week of starting therapy (46).The duration of therapy is variable, and long-termtherapy may be required. Treatment has been con-tinued for several years in some patients, and itmay be required indeﬁnitely to prevent relapse(44). To minimize long-term toxic effects, it is rec-ommended that the retinoid dose be as low as pos-sible, close to 0.5 mg/kg/day (44,47). Symptomssuggestive of skeletal toxicity should be promptlyinvestigated, particularly in those children receiv-ing doses greater than 1.0 mg/kg/day (45,47).However, the severity of skin involvement afterbirth is usually much less severe than that at birth,and if there is improvement, long-term use maynot be indicated.Epidermolytic hyperkeratosisEpidermolytic hyperkeratosis (EHK) is an
Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (EHK) is anautosomal-dominant disorder with the distinctivehistopathology of vacuolar degeneration of the epi-dermis (epidermal lysis) and associated hyperkera-tosis (48). The disorder is known to be due tomutations in the genes for either keratin 1 or 10(49). Vörner described an epidermolytic ichthyosisinvolving only the palms and soles, which has beenfound to be due to mutations in the gene encodingkeratin 9, a keratin expressed only in volar surfaces.The term epidermolytic ichthyosis has been sug-gested for ichthyoses characterized by epidermoly-sis and caused by keratin mutations (50). Sixclinical phenotypes of EHK have been describedwith variations in character and extent of involve-ment. Subtypes with more extensive involvementhave greater beneﬁt than those with mild or limitedinvolvement. Patients who have thick, hystrix,spiny hyperkeratotic skin are prone to tearing ofthe fragile epidermis secondary to traction. Reduc-
ing the thick hyperkeratosis through keratolyticsand systemic retinoids can greatly improve skinappearance and function (Fig. 2a,b). Because ofthe fragility of the epidermis, bacterial colonizationand infection is common in EHK and treatmentwith antibiotics is frequently necessary. By reduc-tion in the hyperkeratosis, systemic retinoidtherapy can reduce the frequency of skin infection.EHK skin tends to be fragile and to blister, and thistendency can be exaggerated by retinoids, particu-larly on volar skin. Therefore, it is particularlyimportant in treating EHK to start initially at a lowdose and increase slowly to avoid exacerbating thetendency to blister (7).PRPPRP is an uncommon (1 : 5000–1 : 50,000) inﬂam-matory papulosquamous disorder of unknowncause (51,52). It affects both children and adults,but is found more commonly in adults. It affectsmen and women equally. Retinoids, alone or incombination with other therapies, are a mainstayof treatment for PRP .
Most PRP cases are acquired. However, whenthe disease is inherited, autosomal-dominant,autosomal-recessive, and X-linked patterns havebeen reported (53). Grifﬁths proposed that PRP beclassiﬁed into ﬁve subtypes, based on age of onset,morphologic presentation and chronicity (Table 1)(51). The most common and best characterizedvariant, Type 1 (Classical Adult), is characterized byerythematous plaques, often starting on the scalpand spreading cephalocaudally, follicular keratoticpapules, and thick “carnuba wax” PPK. Ectropionis a common complication. Uninvolved areas,or “islands of sparing,” are characteristic of thedisease. These islands of sparing can aid clinicaldifferentiation from psoriasis, especially if erythro-derma develops.ABFIG. 2. (A) Epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI) of back before treatment with isotretinoin.

Nail changes are much less common in PRPthan in psoriasis. Hair and teeth abnormalitiesare rare, except in the Type II (Atypical Adult),which sometimes can present with alopecia. Morerecently, a sixth subtype associated with HIV infec-tion has been identiﬁed (54,55). This variant is oftenfollicular-based and pustular. For a summary ofclinical characteristics in the six subtypes, seeTable 1.Retinoids in PRP. Before synthetic retinoids were
Retinoids in PRP. Before synthetic retinoids weredeveloped, high doses of vitamin A were reported toimprove PRP , even though blood levels of vitamin Awere often normal in these patients (3). Once syn-thetic retinoids became available, treatment withisotretinoin or acitretin were reported to controlthe skin lesions in adult onset classic PRP (Type1). Retinoid treatment also has been combinedwith ultraviolet (UV) A or UVB, or with concurrentimmunosuppressive or antiproliferative treatmentssuch as methotrexate (5–30 mg/week), azothio-prine (50–200 mg/week), or fumaric acid (52). UVtreatment should be started slowly, as somepatients with PRP are photosensitive. These agentsmay be effective by decreasing the keratinocytehyperproliferation found in PRP (56). Potential sideeffects of retinoids, including elevations of choles-terol and triglycerides, skin dryness or stickiness,and pseudotumor cerebri must be balanced againsttheir beneﬁts, particularly in children.
DD and Hailey–Hailey disease (HHD)DD and HHD are considered disorders of corniﬁ-cation or keratinization, based on their clinicalpresentations, histologic characteristics, and im-paired differentiation. More recently, the causativemutations in these diseases have been identiﬁedas defects in intracellular Ca2+adenosine triphos-phate (ATP) ases ( ATP2A2 encoding proteinSERCA2 in DD; ATP2C1 encoding SPCA1 in HHD).These Ca2+ATPpases localize to the endoplasmicreticulum in DD or to the Golgi in HHD. Thus,while the relationship between the molecularabnormality and mechanism of retinoid actionis not clear, retinoids are clinically efﬁcacious,particularly in DD.Clinical characteristics. Both DD and HHD are
Clinical characteristics. Both DD and HHD areuncommon diseases inherited as autosomaldominant. DD and HHD differ in their clinicalmorphology, localization and histology. DD mani-fests as keratotic hyperpigmented papules thatcoalesce into plaques. These plaques generally arefound in a seborrheic distribution (face, scalp,neck, shoulders, and central chest), although theyeventually can involve most of the body surface,and, as the condition becomes more chronic, mayform vegetating growths with a foul odor. Mosaicvariants of DD often show a unilateral or pat-terned presentation. Plaques often present with agreasy appearing, grayish scale. The palms andsoles can be affected with punctate keratoses thatcoalesce into generalized thickening. Nails oftenare involved with subungual hyperkeratosis, withalternating red and white streaks, longitudinalsplitting, and triangular “V-shaped” nicks ofthe distal edges. Mucosal surfaces such as theoropharynx and anorectal mucosae can also beinvolved.
HHD is characterized by chronic and recurrenterythematous patches, which may become bullousor vesicular, and develop into weeping, macerated,superinfected plaques. HHD generally presents inthe ﬂexural areas of the neck, groin, and axillae.Lesions in the genital area may become papular.Both DD and HHD demonstrate loss of cellularattachments, particularly desmosomes, leading toTable 1.

the histologic pattern of acantholysis. DD addi-tionally demonstrates apoptosis of keratinocytes.DD is also associated with neuropsychiatric disor-ders (57).DD patients are also at risk for eczema herpeti-cum (58) and eczema vaccinatum (59), and arenot administered smallpox vaccine. Lithium canworsen DD (60,61), perhaps because it suppressesSERCA2b protein expression (62).Retinoid actions in DD and HH. Retinoids com-monly are used to treat DD, but are less commonlyused to treat HHD. Retinoids may be useful intreating DD because they generally enhance kera-tinocyte differentiation (63), which is defective inboth DD and HHD. However, retinoid treatment isa double-edged sword, as they also disrupt desmo-some and adherens junction formation (64,65). UVlight down-regulates expression of both ATP2A2andATP2C1 mRNA, perhaps explaining why bothdiseases are worsened by sunlight (66,67). Retin-oids have been shown to preserve both ATP2A2 and
ATP2C1 expression after UV light exposure (66,67).Clinical uses. Localized DD should ﬁrst be treated
with topical retinoids (68–70), although keratoticpapules have been reported to appear at theperiphery of treated areas. Oral retinoids areusually required to treat more generalized disease,starting at relatively low doses (e.g., 0.5 mg/kgisotretinoin) (71) and adjusting upward until aneffective dose is reached. Both etretinate and itsactive metabolite acitretin, starting at 10–25 mg/day and gradually increasing to approximately0.6 mg/kg/day of acitretin, have been used to treatDD. There may be a difference in responsiveness ofDD to different retinoid drugs. Patients whose DDwas responsive to etretinate have been reported tobe unresponsive to acitretin (72). However, otherstudies have found similar efﬁcacy (73). Low dosesof oral retinoids (etretinate or acitretin 25 mg/day)have also been reported to improve HHD (74,75),although most authors agree that retinoids are lesseffective in HHD than in DD, and recommendother therapeutic approaches (76,77).
Adjuvant and alternative treatments. Topical 5-ﬂuorouracil has been reported to reduce the kera-totic papules in localized DD. Caution shouldbe used to avoid excessive irritation of treatedareas (78). Systemic antibiotic treatment is usefulin both DD and HHD, particularly when directedagainst Staphylococcus aureus . Immunosuppres-sion, either with topical corticosteroids or with sys-temic corticosteroids (79), or cyclosporin (80), hasalso been reported to improve the inﬂammatorycomponent of these diseases. Ablative therapiessuch as laser (81–83), dermabrasion (84), or excisionand grafting (85), may be used in severe cases.Treat-ment with botulinum toxin (86) has been helpful intreating some HHD lesions, as it impairs sweatingin injected areas.Erythrokeratodermia variabilisThe erythrokeratodermias are a group of skin disor-
ders marked by localized patches of erythema andareas of either localized or generalized hyperkera-tosis. In erythrokeratodermia varibilis, patientsdevelop persistent, hyperkeratotic plaques withaccentuated skin markings. These may be general-ized or localized. Sharply demarcated red patchesdevelop, which vary in size and may extend toseveral centimeters. The red areas are geographicin shape and move over minutes to hours. Somepatients complain of burning in the areas of redpatches. If left untreated, in some patients, theplaques can lead to thick areas of hyperkeratosis.The condition is usually inherited in anautosomal-dominant pattern, but recessively inhe-rited forms have been described. While involve-ment in most families is conﬁned to the skin, atype of erythrokeratodermia with ataxia has beendescribed. Mutations in GJB3 (connexin 31) or GJB4
(connexin 30.3) have been found which encodeconnexin proteins (87,88). Connexins form gapjunctions that permit intercellular signalingnecessary for tissue homeostasis, growth control,development, and synchronization of cellularresponse to stimuli (89).
Systemic retinoids are extremely effective, evenat low doses, at dramatically improving the hyper-keratosis and in many patients minimizing thedisease-associated red plaques (90,91). Untreatedpatients with thick areas of hyperkeratosis shouldbe started with low doses of isotretinoin or acitretin(/H113490.25 mg/kg/day) to avoid a sudden shedding ofthick areas, a situation that can be uncomfortable.The dose can be increased as tolerated to achievesufﬁcient clearing. The efﬁcacy of a very low dose ofretinoid in this condition may be associated withless chronic toxicity (e.g., bone toxicity) and shouldbe considered in the risk/beneﬁt discussion whendeciding to treat with systemic retinoids.Keratitis, ichthyosis, and deafness(KID) syndromeSkin involvement in KID syndrome varies from dis-crete red plaques to mild, generalized hyperkerato-DiGiovanna et al.34
sis. Distinctive plaques may have a ﬁgurateappearance, sharp border, and verrucous surface,and may be symmetrically arrayed on the face.In contrast to the typical ichthyosiform scaling,patients may have thickened plaques with littlescale. Patients may have an increased susceptibilityto bacterial, fungal, or viral infections. Scalp andnails may be affected. Infections of the hair-bearing areas of the scalp may lead to recurrentpustules, nodules, and draining sinuses.While patients have been reported to respond toacitretin treatment (92), the skin manifestations ofKID syndrome are often not responsive to retinoids(93,94). In addition, there has been concern thatsystemic retinoids can exacerbate the cornealneovasularization (95). Most cases of KID syndromehave been inherited in an autosomal-dominantpattern and mutations in GJB2 (encoding connexin26) or GJB6 (encoding connexin 30) have been
26) or GJB6 (encoding connexin 30) have beenfound (96,97). The reason that retinoids are veryeffective at low dose in the connexin disorder eryth-rokeratodermia variabilis, but not in the connexindisorder KID syndrome, is not understood.PPKsSystemic retinoids have beneﬁcial effects in some,but not all patients with PPK. Thinning of thickpalmar skin can result in better movement of thedigits, improved tactile sensation and enhancedfunction. Systemic retinoids can particularlybeneﬁt individuals with PPK who have constrictionof digits (pseudo-ainhum) and are at risk for auto-amputation (Fig. 3a,b). However, the effectivenessof acetretin in pachyonychia congenita has beenpoor (98), with many patients discontinuing retin-oids because of increased pain, and 53% refusing
to use oral retinoids again. Increased vulnerabilityand sensitivity during retinoid treatment mayrestrict normal function of hands and feet (99–101). This is particularly evident in EI affecting thepalms and soles, in which blistering may occurwith retinoid therapy. For PPK, lower doses of aci-tretin (10–25 mg/day) and treatment for a longerduration is generally superior to shorter duration,higher dosages and use of isotretinoin (98). Carefuldose titration is warranted and patients should befully informed about potential adverse effects andactively involved in the choice of treatment, dose,and duration. Randomized, controlled, prospec-tive clinical trials with both objective and patient-centered subjective end points are warranted tofurther deﬁne the PPK subsets that most beneﬁtfrom retinoids.Miscellaneous disorders of corniﬁcationThere are many individuals with ichthyosis who do
There are many individuals with ichthyosis who donot have a ﬁrm diagnosis. This may be due to thefact that their disease is very rare or that the disorderis difﬁcult to characterize. Because the systemicretinoids beneﬁt many different ichthyosiformconditions, regardless of the underlying patho-physiology, a trial of retinoid therapy can be consid-ered when hyperkeratosis and thickening becomesymptomatic and poorly responsive to topicalagents.SummaryWhile systemic retinoid therapy has been knownsince the early Egyptians, its recent history has pro-vided a major advance in the therapy of the ichthy-oses and related skin types. For individual patients,care should be used in crafting an analysis ofthe risk : beneﬁt ratio and in deciding when it isappropriate to start therapy. Because responses toretinoids are variable, many patients need a briefretinoid trial to assess beneﬁt in order to make aninformed risk/beneﬁt decision.Patients should understand that these drugs
Patients should understand that these drugshave side effects that can be severe, but are man-ageable. Effective topical therapies should be usedcontinuously. Doses of retinoid should be kept aslow as is practical. Monitoring laboratory param-eters, particularly lipid and transaminase levels,consistent pregnancy avoidance, and for chronictherapy recurring evaluation of bone health, caninsure that systemic retinoids are used safely andeffectively.A BFIG. 3.
