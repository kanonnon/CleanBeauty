The incidence, morbidity and mortality rates of skin cancers are increasingand, therefore, pose a signiﬁcant public health concern. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is themajor etiologic agent in the development of skin cancers. UVR causes DNA damage andgenetic mutations, which subsequently lead to skin cancer. A clearer understanding of
UVR is crucial in the prevention of skin cancer. This article reviews UVR, its damagingeffects on the skin and its relationship to UV immunosuppression and skin cancer. Severalfactors inﬂuence the amount of UVR reaching the earth’s surface, including ozonedepletion, UV light elevation, latitude, altitude, and weather conditions. The currenttreatment modalities utilizing UVR (i.e. phototherapy) can also predispose to skin cancers.Unnecessary exposure to the sun and artiﬁcial UVR (tanning lamps) are important personalattributable risks. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of skin cancer withan emphasis on carefully evaluated statistics, the epidemiology of UVR-induced skincancers, incidence rates, risk factors, and preventative behaviors & strategies, includingpersonal behavioral modiﬁcations and public educational initiatives.Burden of skin cancerSkin cancer is the most common type of cancer in lightskinned populations around the world.1Skin cancers are
mainly divided into melanoma, and nonmelanoma skincancers (NMSCs), the latter including basal and squa-mous cell carcinomas (BCC and SCC, respectively). Mela-noma is responsible for most of the cancer relatedmortalities, and NMSCs are typically described as havinga more benign course with locally aggressive features.Nevertheless, they represent ‘‘the most common type’’ ofcancer in humans and they can result in signiﬁcant disﬁg-urement, leading to adverse physical and psychologicalconsequences for the affected patients.2Nonmelanoma skin cancersIt is estimated that 2–3 million cases of NMSCs occurworldwide each year.3,4The incidence varies with veryhigh rates in the Caucasian populations of the world.2For incidence, the overall upward trend observed in mostparts of Europe, Canada, USA and Australia shows anaverage increase between 3% and 8% a year.1The inci-
1The inci-dence of NMSCs is over 1.3 million cases each year inthe U.S.; in fact, this incidence rate is ‘‘expected to doublein the next 30 years.’’5Approximately 30% of all newlydiagnosed cancers in the U.S. are BCC, making it themost commonly diagnosed cancer in this country.6Basal cell carcinoma, which accounts for 80–85% ofall NMSCs, rarely metastasizes to other organs.2It is themost common malignancy in white people. Its worldwideincidence is increasing by up to 10%, ‘‘with highest ratesin elderly men and increasing incidence in youngwomen.’’7Although mortality is low, this malignancycauses considerable morbidity and places a huge burdenon healthcare systems worldwide.7SCC, which accountsfor 15–20% of all NMSCs, is more likely to invade othertissues and can cause death.2As a result of the benign nature of NMSC characteris-tics, some patients may remain unregistered and undiag-nosed, leading to an under-representation of the numberof cases.
2Moreover, as NMSCs have localized symptomsand primarily manifest in older individuals, they mayremain undiagnosed.Basal cell carcinoma and SCC are usually found in sun-exposed areas, especially the head and neck regions.8,9
and primarily manifest in older individuals, they mayremain undiagnosed.Basal cell carcinoma and SCC are usually found in sun-exposed areas, especially the head and neck regions.8,9They are both positively related to the amount of ultravio-let radiation (UVR) received and inversely proportional tothe ‘‘degree of skin pigmentation in the population.’’2Women have higher occurrences than men for both typesof cancers on the legs, consistent with greater sun exposureat this site.9In 2006, a study noted that the ratio of BCC toSCC is 4 : 1 for the head and neck.10The probability ofgetting SCC is less than getting BCC; however, SCC ‘‘car-ries a > 10-fold higher risk of metastasis and mortality.’’6MelanomaIt is estimated that 132,000 new cases of melanoma occurworldwide each year.3,4Incidence rates are at least 16 978International Journal of Dermatology 2010, 49, 978–986 ª2010 The International Society of Dermatology
times greater in Caucasians than African Americans and10 times greater than Hispanics.10,11The WHO also‘‘estimates that as many as 65,161 people a year world-wide die from malignant skin cancer,’’ approximately48,000 of whom are registered.3,12Melanoma representsonly about 3% of all skin cancers in the U.S., but itaccounts for about 75% of all skin cancer deaths.12–14The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) estimatedthat in 2009, there will be about 121,840 new melanomacases in the U.S. with 8650 deaths ( /C241 death everyhour).12This mortality value is remarkably high consider-ing the fact that melanoma is nearly always curable in itsearly stages; however, this high number can be attributedto the late diagnosis of the disease in which the cancerspreads to other parts of the body. Over the last threedecades, the incidence and mortality rates of melanomahave increased in the U.S.15In particular, of all
15In particular, of allneoplasms, approximately 20–30% of skin cancers arediagnosed in Caucasians, 2–4% are in Asians and 1–2%are in blacks and Asian Indians.10In 2006, of all skincancers, melanoma represented 1–8% in blacks, 10–15%in Asian Indians and 19% in Japanese.10Moreover, eventhough skin cancers are not as prevalent in individualswith darker skin, they can have more morbidity andfatalities as they may go undiagnosed for a while.10Melanoma most often appears on the trunk of men andthe lower legs of women, although it can be found on thehead, neck, or elsewhere.10,13Researchers estimate that 1of 50 people in the U.S. in 2010 will be diagnosed withmelanoma at some point in their lives. Speciﬁcally, among
Caucasians, the rate of increase of melanoma incidence is3–7% each year. Intermediate skin pigmentations, (i.e.,Hispanics and Asians) have skin cancers resembling bothCaucasians and dark-skinned groups in terms of clinicalpresentation and epidemiology. This issue is an importantpublic health concern because by 2050, it is estimatedthat about half of the U.S. population will consist of His-panics, Asians and blacks.10As the incidence of skin cancer is increasing at analarming rate, it is one of the greatest threats to publichealth. The pathogenesis of skin cancer is multifactorial.However, UVR (a potent carcinogen) is a major contrib-uting factor.8,9,13Our aim was to provide an overview ofskin cancer, its epidemiology, incidence and the relation-ship of UVR-induced immunosuppression with skin can-cer; protective measures and preventative strategies arealso mentioned.Ultraviolet radiationSunlight is a continuous spectrum of electromagnetic radia-
tion that is divided into three major spectrums of wave-length: ultraviolet, visible and infrared.16The UV range isthe most signiﬁcant spectrum of sunlight that causes photo-aging and skin cancer. UVR is subdivided into ultravioletA [UVA (315–400 nm)], ultraviolet B [UVB (280–315 nm)] and ultraviolet C [UVC (100–280 nm)].17Approximately 90–99% of the solar UVR energy thatreaches the earth’s surface is UVA, where only 1–10%is UVB (Table 1).18,19One study indicated that about 65–90% of all melanomas are attributable to UVR exposure.20UVR and skin cancer pathogenesisThe damaging effects of UVR on the skin are thought tobe caused by direct cellular damage and alterationsin immunologic function. UVR produces DNA damage(formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers), gene muta-tions, immunosuppression, oxidative stress and inﬂamma-tory responses, all of which have an important role inphotoaging of the skin and skin cancer.21In addition to

this, UVR creates mutations to p53 tumor suppressorgenes; these are genes which are involved in DNA repairor the apoptosis of cells that have lots of DNA damage.Therefore, if p53 genes are mutated, they will no longerbe able to aid in the DNA repair process; as a result,there is ‘‘dysregulation of apoptosis, expansion ofmutated keratinocytes, and initiation of skin cancer.’’22UVA radiation has an important role in the carcinogene-sis of stem cells of the skin.22UVB radiation inducesDNA damage, which causes inﬂammatory responses andtumorigenesis.21Skin color and photoprotection
21Skin color and photoprotectionThe ‘‘low incidence of cutaneous malignancies in darker-skinned groups is primarily a result of photoprotectionprovided by increased epidermal melanin, which providesan inherent sun protection factor (SPF) of up to 13.4 inblacks. Epidermal melanin in blacks ﬁlters twice as muchUVB radiation as does that in Causasians. Black epider-mis transmits 7.4% of UVB and 17.5% of ultraviolet Arays, compared with 24% and 55% in Caucasian epider-mis, respectively.10This is because the larger, more mel-anized melanosomes in the epidermis of dark skin absorband scatter more light energy than the smaller, lessmelanized melanosomes of white skin. The dose of UVRrequired to produce a minimally perceptible erythema hasbeen estimated to be 6–33 times greater in blacks than inwhites.’’10Factors which inﬂuence the emission of UVRUltraviolet radiation that reaches the earth’s surface can
increase or decrease based on a variety of factors. Onefactor is the ozone layer, which forms a thin shield in thestratospheric atmosphere, protecting life on earth fromthe sun’s UV rays; this layer absorbs all UVC radiation,most UVB radiation and very little UVA radiation.23Sincethe mid 1980s, scientists began to be concerned that theozone layer was being depleted.24,25The reason for thin-ning of the stratospheric ozone is resulting from therelease of ozone-depleting substances and chemicals (chlo-roﬂuorocarbons) that are released from industry andmotor vehicle exhaust into the atmosphere.24An approxi-mate 1% decrease in ozone levels corresponds to a 1–2%increase in the mortality caused by melanoma.23Likewise,a 10% decrease in the ozone levels will cause 300,000new nonmelanoma and 4500 new melanoma skin cancercases.4Depletion of the ozone layer results in increased
UVR, (especially UVB, which is the most carcinogenicUVR), reaching the earth’s surface. UVB is directlyabsorbed by DNA and causes structural DNA damage.UVA causes indirect DNA damage through the formationof reactive oxygen species, which create breaks in DNA.These events lead to mutations and then skin cancer.26Another factor affecting the level of UVR that reaches theearth’s surface is the time of day and the time of year.The sun exerts its highest peak between 10AMto 4 PM.During this time, the sun’s rays have the least distance totravel through the atmosphere and UVB levels are at theirhighest. In the early morning and late afternoon, the sun’srays pass through the atmosphere at an angle and theirintensity is greatly reduced. The sun’s angle varies withthe seasons, causing the intensity of UV rays to change.UV intensity tends to be the highest during the summerseason.23,27Environmental factors that increase theamount of UVR exposure to humans include latitudes
closer to the equator. At higher latitudes the sun is lowerin the sky, so UV rays must travel a greater distancethrough ozone-rich portions of the atmosphere and inturn, less UVR is emitted. Hence, living closer to theequator increases UV exposure, thus increasing the inci-dence of skin cancers.23For every 1000 meters increase inelevation, the UVR intensity increases by 10–12%.17UVlevels also depend on cloud cover; thus, there are lowerUV levels at higher cloud cover densities.17In the sum-
elevation, the UVR intensity increases by 10–12%.17UVlevels also depend on cloud cover; thus, there are lowerUV levels at higher cloud cover densities.17In the sum-mer, ‘‘the sun is higher in the sky, and less ultravioletradiation is absorbed during its passage through the atmo-sphere. Fog, haze, clouds, and pollutants can reduce ultra-violet levels by 10–90%. Snow, sand, and metal canreﬂect up to 90% of ultraviolet [radiation]. Sea water canreﬂect up to 15%, whereas little reﬂection occurs on stillwater (e.g., a pool). Shade alone reduces solar UVR by50–95%. The amount of protection varies considerablybetween different shade settings, with a beach umbrellashowing the least and dense foliage the most protection.The best technique for reducing ultraviolet exposure is toavoid the sun, especially in the middle of the day.’’23UVR and damaging effectsLifestyle changes during the past ﬁve decades, with an
increase in exposure to sunlight because of outdoor activi-ties and worsening sunbathing habits often result in skincancers.8,13Among Caucasians, ‘‘intense early sunburnsand blistering sunburns are closely associated with thedevelopment of melanoma.’’10As a result of chronic UVexposure, skin aging, ‘‘wrinkles, uneven skin pigmenta-tion, loss of skin elasticity and a disturbance of skin bar-rier functions’’ result. These ‘‘changes in the skin thatsuperimpose the alterations of chronological aging’’ referto photoaging.28The development of SCCs, BCCs andmalignant melanoma is often associated with painful sun-burns.29In fact, ‘‘more than 1 severe sunburn in child-hood is associated with a 2-fold increase in melanomarisk.’’30Chronic exposure to UVR is known as themost important risk factor for the development of actinicInternational Journal of Dermatology 2010, 49, 978–986 ª2010 The International Society of DermatologyReview UVR and skin cancer Narayanan, Saladi, and Fox 980

keratoses (precursors of SCC).29Exposure to UVR duringchildhood and adolescence plays a role in the futuredevelopment of skin cancer.31,32It was noted that in theUS, most people receive 22.73% of their lifetime expo-sure to the sun by 18 years of age.14This meant that dur-ing childhood (1–18 years of age), most people receivedapproximately one-ﬁfth of their total sun exposure.14Thetotal amount of sun received over the years, and overex-posure resulting in sunburns are associated with skin can-cers.31A history of exposure to sunlight, particularlysunburns, during childhood is also the most importantbehavioral risk factor for the development of NMSC andmelanoma.32,33The epidemiology implicating UV exposure as a causeof melanoma is further supported by biological evidencethat damage caused by UVR, particularly damage toDNA, plays a central role in the development of mela-noma.13The relative risk of skin cancer is three times as
high among people born in areas that receive highamounts of UVR from the sun than those who move tothose areas in adulthood.31Likewise, outdoor workershave a higher risk than indoor workers.20The aforementioned citations conclude that there is adose-related relationship between sunlight exposure andthe incidence of skin cancer. For the development of BCCand melanoma, intermittent intense exposures appear tocarry a higher risk than lower level chronic exposures,even if the total UV dose is the same. By contrast, the riskfor SCC is strongly associated with chronic UV exposurebut not with intermittent exposure.33Taken together, epi-demiologic studies and experimental studies in laboratoryanimals indicate that intermittent intense and chronicexposures to solar UVR are the primary cause of NMSCsand melanoma.UVR-induced immunosuppressionUltraviolet immunosuppression is considered an impor-tant event in skin carcinogenesis.26UV exposure
tant event in skin carcinogenesis.26UV exposureadversely affects the skin’s immune system by: (1) dimin-ishing antigen-presenting cell function, (2) inducingimmunosuppressive cytokine production and (3) modulat-ing contact and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions.34The role of UV-induced immunosuppression and its rele-vance to the mechanism of skin cancer has not been fullyelucidated. One study showed that renal transplant recipi-ents, who are taking immunosuppressive therapies, haveincreased immunosuppression and decreased immunosur-veillance; therefore, they are more susceptible to cancers,especially skin cancers (90% being NMSCs). Such indi-viduals are more prone to skin cancer if they have UVRexposure and if they are light-skinned.35However, skincancers tend to develop in sun-exposed areas regardlessof sun exposure before or after transplantation.23,36,54Among transplant recipients, BCC risk had a linear
increase and SCC risk had an exponential increase. Addi-tionally, within this group, older individuals have a fasterincidence of skin cancer because of longer UVR exposureover their lifetimes.35,37Implications of UVR in clinical therapies andskin cancerPhototherapyPhototherapy is currently being used to treat various cuta-neous diseases.38,39These phototherapies are conductedusing broadband UVB (290–320 nm), narrowband UVB(311–313 nm), UVA-1 (340–400 nm), and psoralens plusUVA (PUVA).38–40Despite the positive aspects of PUVA,its short-term usage is associated with erythema, edema,and sunburns, while its long-term usage is correlated withphotoaging and skin cancers.38–40PUVA therapy is muta-genic and carcinogenic. The determinants of the risk ofNMSC and melanomas in PUVA-treated patients can
NMSC and melanomas in PUVA-treated patients canvary with the dose and length of time of exposure toPUVA. Both European and American studies have demon-strated that patients exposed to high doses of PUVA ther-apy have a substantially increased risk of SCC andmelanoma.41–43Some data also indicate a small but sig-niﬁcant increase of BCC.41–43Patients treated with PUVAmay also develop large, irregular, unevenly pigmented,
41–43Some data also indicate a small but sig-niﬁcant increase of BCC.41–43Patients treated with PUVAmay also develop large, irregular, unevenly pigmented,dark lentigines known as ‘‘PUVA lentigines,’’ which maybe precursors of melanoma.43A recent large-scale cohortstudy revealed that patients who had undergone PUVAtherapy were still susceptible to developing skin cancerseven after 25 years of discontinuation of PUVA. There-fore, even though PUVA can be a useful tool for treatingseveral skin conditions, it is still a major risk factor formany skin conditions.44UVR relating to tanning beds and lampsEvery year, approximately 28 million Americans arereported to use artiﬁcial UV tanning.45The NationalInstitute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)warns that solar UVR and exposure to sunlamps and tan-ning beds are carcinogenic. It has been suggested thatartiﬁcial UVR is linked to melanoma development.46,47The effects of natural and artiﬁcial UV exposure may take
20 or more years to produce skin cancer.48In a study, itwas estimated that people using artiﬁcial UV tanninghave a 2–3 fold increased risk of NMSCs.48,49A recentstudy showed that tanning-bed bulbs emit mostly UVAradiation and /C245% UVB.50In general, young womenwere more frequent users of tanning beds than men. Inaddition, there is a positive correlation between tanningª2010 The International Society of Dermatology International Journal of Dermatology 2010, 49, 978–986Narayanan, Saladi, and Fox UVR and skin cancer Review 981 13654632, 2010, 9, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-4632.2010.04474.x by Cochrane Japan, Wiley Online Library on [26/09/2024].

This canbe achieved by (1) minimizing sun exposure (seekingshade) during peak hours (10AM–4PM), (2) wearing sun-protective clothing (including hats with a brim all around,wrap-around sunglasses, which block both UVA and UVBrays, etc.), (3) using sunscreen with both UVA/UVB &physical blocks on your body and lips, and (4) avoidingtanning beds/lamps – interestingly, ‘‘many tanning salonpatrons erroneously believe that an artiﬁcial tan preventssubsequent sunburn and is safer than tanning out-doors.’’50,51Several studies have demonstrated that theuse of sun-protective wear can decrease the number ofmoles and pre-malignant lesions.52
moles and pre-malignant lesions.52Sunscreens are an important adjunct to other types ofprotection against UV exposure. Many studies have dem-onstrated that regular sunscreen use is effective in reduc-ing the incidence of actinic keratoses and SCCs.23Another randomized trial demonstrated that amongchildren who are at high risk for developing melanoma,sunscreens are effective in reducing moles, the precursorsand the strongest risk factors for melanoma.53The AADrecommends broad-spectrum sunscreen covering bothUVA & UVB with a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of atleast 15 with reapplication every 2 h when outdoors, evenon cloudy days; additionally, one should make efforts toTable 3 Prevention strategies for skin cancer10,23,28,49–63Minimize sun exposureMinimize sun exposure, especially from 10 AM–4 PM(peak sun hours)Sun protection

minimize sun exposure and to apply sunscreen to children6 months of age and older.54The AAD and the NIEHSalso recommend that the public avoid tanning bedsbecause of their possible association with skin can-cers.49,54Additionally, patients are advised to performfrequent skin examinations and get complete examina-tions from health care professionals on a routine basis.Moreover, if a mole is changing color or increasing insize, one should seek medical attention.10In regard to sunscreen usage, many studies have showna reduction in several skin conditions and some skin can-cers in people, who use sunscreens regularly.23Moreover,UVR ‘‘is responsible for the production of vitamin D 3inthe skin. Vitamin D 3is hydroxylated in the liver and kid-ney to produce 1,25 (OH) 2vitamin D, a hormone that
regulates calcium homeostasis and bone maintenance.There has been controversy over the belief that peopleneed to receive sunlight to maintain adequate vitamin Dlevels in the body. It has been suggested that current sun-avoidance practices, including the use of sunscreen prod-ucts, may or will contribute to a widespread vitamin Ddeﬁciency. Evidence to support this emerges from clinicalstudies demonstrating that the application of sunscreenproducts will reduce artiﬁcial, UV-induced vitamin D insunscreen users. However, studies examining actual vita-min D status in populations using sunscreen productshave not found deﬁciencies in vitamin D or clinical evi-dence of such a deﬁciency. This could be because the sunis not the only source of vitamin D synthesis. Supple-ments can provide adequate intake, as can milk and
orange juice fortiﬁed with vitamin D. The U.S. Depart-ment of Agriculture recommends 200 IU/d for childrenand younger adults (<50 years old), 400 IU/d for olderadults (>50 years old), and 600 to 800 IU/d for theelderly (>70 years old). Eight ounces of fortiﬁed milk ororange juice contains 100 IU (2.5 g), which is also theamount of vitamin D found in approximately half a tea-spoon of cod liver oil. The sun-and-vitamin-D issue hasbecome less signiﬁcant because of the fact that most foodsare now enriched with vitamin D’’ and there are vitaminD supplements available to alleviate any deﬁciencies.55Nevertheless, clothing and sunscreen usage has beenshown, for the most part, to reduce UVR exposure.23Public interventions and educationVarious skin cancer task forces have proposed severalimportant guidelines to decrease the rising skin cancerincidence.56,57These brieﬂy include the following: (1) the
56,57These brieﬂy include the following: (1) theestablishment of policies that reduce exposure to UVR;(2) providing and maintaining physical and social envi-ronments, which support sun safety and are consistentwith the development of other healthful habits; (3) pro-fessional pre-service and in-service skin cancer educationfor school administrators, teachers, physical educationteachers and coaches, nurses, and others working inhealthcare; (4) health services and organizations toincrease skin cancer prevention education, sun-safetyenvironments and making these policies readily availableto the public; (5) lastly, the promotion of free skin cancerscreening programs are also highly encouraged.56,57Several studies ‘‘support the notion that individuals’beliefs about sun-risk and sun-safe behaviors have amajor inﬂuence on their intentional sunbathing and sun-bathing consequences.’’58Education can also be greatly
58Education can also be greatlyinﬂuential for people during decision making. However,education should be age-appropriate and it should createawareness, knowledge, attitudes and behavioral skills thatpeople need to prevent skin cancer. Moreover, this educa-tion should be linked to opportunities for practicing sun-safety behaviors. Primary care physicians can have largerroles in preventing skin cancer if they are trained to ‘‘rec-ognize and educate patients at risk, as well as direct themto be followed under dermatology care.’’59Therefore,there is a need for education related to UV exposure and
59Therefore,there is a need for education related to UV exposure andskin cancer risk. To address this issue, it would be beneﬁ-cial to implement educational programs tailored forschools/workplaces, homes and doctors’ visits. Despitethe importance of patient education by physicians, Frei-man et al., determined that only 19% of selected patientsreceived sun advice from their physicians before theywere diagnosed with melanoma and 49% received adviceafter diagnosis. The authors go on to say that ‘‘patientswith known risk factors were not preferentially targetedfor advice before their diagnosis.’’59This shows howimportant it is for physicians and dermatologists to pro-vide sun-related education. Patient education can includeadvice pertaining to sunscreen usage, reapplication meth-ods, risk factors and tanning bed dangers. In addition tothis, visual aids can be valuable in physicians’ ofﬁces asthey can display the results of people after receiving agreat deal of UVR.
great deal of UVR.60Naylor and Robinson mention sun-protection strategies, which physicians can utilize to pro-mote safe sun behaviors. These include: (1) setting a dateto end intentional tanning, (2) determining which pastbehaviors were helpful in protecting against sun exposureand trying to incorporate them (as well as other tech-niques) in the future, (3) making strategies to overcomeobstacles and (4) involving family members so everyonewould remind each other about using sun protection.These authors suggest that the techniques listed abovewill be beneﬁcial if they are implemented on individualpatients rather than the entire public.61In addition to the above, it is also advisable to providechildren with sun-safety education, which can also inﬂu-ence their caregivers.62By encouraging and teachingyoungsters about healthy sun exposure habits, one

Robinson and Rademaker suggest that byeducating and promoting healthy sun-protection behav-iors in adults, children will be able to learn these positivebehaviors and apply them in their lives. Moreover, if chil-dren practice sun-protective techniques, they will reducetheir cumulative lifelong sun exposure and intense epi-sodic sun exposure, hence reducing their risk for skin can-cer (NMSCs and melanoma).63In addition to the youth,such sun safety education programs are also vital for peo-ple at high risk of getting skin cancer.28Besides patient education, public health campaigns,which are broadcast via the media, can also serve toteach the public.60These messages should be concise, eas-ily attainable and they should target speciﬁc audiences(public and healthcare professionals).62In conclusion, by
62In conclusion, byproviding proper education, people will be more aware ofthe truths and consequences of excessive UV exposureand skin cancer. This will hopefully allow them to takepreventive steps, to reduce their risk of skin cancer.Through public education, healthcare agencies/providerscan increase the public’s awareness of skin cancers, theircauses and preventative measures, which may be bothlife-changing and life-saving.56,57Questions1.
