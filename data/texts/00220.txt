REVIEW Open AccessSkin hyperpigmentation and its treatmentwith herbs: an alternative methodPrity Rathee1, Sunil Kumar1,2*, Dinesh Kumar1, Beena Kumari2and Savita S. Yadav3AbstractBackground: With an increasing number of patients, those who are facing a lot of skin-related complaints, oftenreferred to as skin of pigmentation patients, are on the rise. Among all the most common complaints in patientswith skin of color is hyperpigmentation. So, there is need of herbal formulation for treatment of hyperpigmentation.Main body: This review article addresses the different types of hyperpigmentation, causes, and its treatment withherbs for the management of the skin hyperpigmentation. As uneven pigmentation of skin or hyperpigmentation isa common skin condition, which occurs when the skin produces more melanin. This can make spots or patches ofskin appear darker than surrounding areas. Some forms of hyperpigmentation with post-inflammatory, melasma,
and sun spots are more likely to affect areas of face, arms, and legs due to sun exposure and injury. Although theavailability of multiple treatments for the condition which leads to some adverse effects, hyperpigmentationcontinues to present skin care management challenges for dermatologists.Conclusion: Some plants and phytoconstituents, e.g., Azadirachta indica ,Glycyrrhiza glabra ,Panax ginseng andgenistein, ellagic acids, quercetin, are very useful in herbal cosmetic as anti-hyperpigmentry agents in cosmeticindustries. Some of flavonoids and triterpenoids present in plants also show their effect as antioxidant and skinwhitening agents. It is expected that this review will compile and improve the existing knowledge on the potentialutilization of herbs for the treatment of skin hyperpigmentation.Keywords: Melanin, Hyperpigmentation, Tyrosinase, Age spot, MelasmaBackgroundSkin hyperpigmentation is a disorder in which patches
of skin become darker in color than the normal sur-rounding skin. This occurs when melanin is overpro-duced in certain spots on the skin. Melanin is animportant pigment in skin hyperpigmentation whichis produced by the process called melanogenesis. In-creased melanin pigment in epithelial cell is calledmelanosis. Epidermal melanosis is when melanocytesare in normal number but melanin is increased inhyper pigmented skin and dermal melanosis occurwhen melanin is present within the dermis betweenbundles of collagen [ 1]. Melanocyte cells (one mel-anocyte is surrounded by approximately 36 keratino-cytes) produce two typ e of melanin pigment,eumelanin (Black or brown) and pheomelanin (yellowreddish) which are responsible for skin, hair, and eyescolor in human. There is mainly three type of skin 3hyper-pigmentation which are melsama [ 2,3], post-inflammatory hyper pigmentation, and age spot orliver spot [ 4]. Skin hyper-pigmentation is caused by
sun exposure, Addison ’s disease [ 5], hormonal imbal-ance, and vitamin B 12[6]. In skin cell, UV radiationproduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) which activatethe intracellular signaling pathways includingmutagen-activated protein kinase. As human keratino-cyte exposed to UV-B radiation shows higher p38mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPAK) activity,which produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as© The Author(s). 2021 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License,which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you giveappropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate ifchanges were made.

1L-1, cyclooxygenase (cox-2), and TNF- αexpression[7]. There are two enzymes responsible for melaninproduction; one is tyrosinase and the other is dopa-chrome tatuomerase. Tyrsosinase is a main enzyme inmelanin growth and over activity of tyrosinase en-zyme causes hyper-pigmentation [ 8]. Tyrosinase in-volves amino acid tyrosine which on hydroxylationconvert into L-3,4-DOPA that form DOPA-quinine byoxidation which is further oxidized by a free radical-coupling pathway to form melanin [ 9,10]. The otherenzyme dopachrome tatuomerase catalyze the trans-formation of dopachrome into 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) [ 11]. There are many herbsor chemical compound found which has tyrosinase in-hibitory properties. Tyrosin ase inhibitors demands areincreasing on the industrial and clinical scale, so in-vitro assay and screening technique are also devel-oped for tyrosinase inhibitor and other skin whiteningagent [ 12]. Herbs like Glycyrrhiza glabra ,Panax gin-
seng,Embica officinalis ,Azadiracta indica ,Curcumalonga [13], etc. have been used for treatment of skinhyperpigmentation as shown in Table 1. Also, phyto-constituents like ellagic acids, quercetin, and somewhitening agent like kojic acid [ 72], arbutin [ 73], etc.are used for treatment as skin hyperpigmentation .Main textType of skin hyperpigmentationPost-inflammatory hyperpigmentationIt is the acquired hypermelanosis after the skin inflam-mation or injury that can occur in all skin types. It mayoccur due to infections such as dermatophytosis, allergicreactions such as mosquito bites, psoriasis, hypersensi-tive reactions due to medications, or injury from irritant(Fig. 1a), or cosmetic procedures. However, acne vulgaris(Fig. 1b), atopical dermatitis, and impetigo are verycommon causes of it. Indeed, post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation (PIH) is mainly common after acne indark-skinned patients. PIH results from the overproduc-
tion of melanin or an irregular dispersion of pigmentafter inflammation. There may be rise in melanocyte ac-tivity which may be stimulated by inflammatory media-tors as well as reactive oxygen species. Light to darkbrown coloration in epidermal post inflammatory hyper-pigmentation, whereas dermal PIH tends to be grey toblack coloration [ 74].MelasmaMelasma is an acquired hypermelanosis characterized byasymmetric, brown-colored, irregular, reticulated mac-ules on sun exposed areas of the skin, especially the face(Fig. 1c, d). However, chronic ultraviolet (UV) exposure,female hormone stimulation, and predisposed geneticbackground have all been proposed to play a role in thedevelopment of melasma [ 74]. It is also noticed that arelease of histamine from mast cells in response to UVirradiation has been demonstrated to stimulate melano-genesis, which is mediated by H2 receptors via proteinkinase A activation. Sebocytes have been hypothesized
to contribute to the development of melasma. Furtherstudies are needed on the role of sebocytes in the patho-genesis of melasma [ 75].Effect of hormone on melasma Hormones play a rolein the pathogenesis of melasma, estrogen, and progester-one have an impact in melasma development, becausemelasma is common in pregnancy, hormonal contracep-tive use, estrogen therapy in prostate cancer patients,and conjugate estrogen use in women after menopause.In females, melasma is more frequent than in males.Melasma is an undesirable cutaneous effect of oral con-traceptives. Melasma is commonly regarded as a physio-logical change in skin caused by hormone changes.Estrogens play a major role in both physiological andpathological conditions of the skin, including pigmenta-tion. Estrogen and progesterone biological effects areregulated by their different receptors [ 75,76].Therapeutic implications The main method of treatingmelasma is still topical depigmentants.

Therapeutic implications The main method of treatingmelasma is still topical depigmentants. The most com-mon anti-melanogic agent is hydroquinone, which in-hibits the conversion of 1-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine tomelanin via competitive tyrosinase inhibition, has alsoraised safety concerns such as exogenous ochronosis,permanent depigmentation, and potential cancer hazards[2]. The following are considered as alternatives to top-ical agents identified for having depigmenting propertieswith no adverse effects: resveratrol, azelaic acid, 4 –n-butyl resorcinol, niacinamide, kojic acid, and ascorbicacid [ 75].Age spotT h eb r o w ns p o t so ft h es k i na r ea g e dm a r k s( F i g . 1e).Skin regions, including the face and the back of thehands, grow primarily on that part of skin, which isoften exposed to sunlight [ 9] .A g es p o t sa r eb r o w nb e -cause of lipofuscin bodies of the basal cells. Lipofuscinis the lysosome lipid and protein mixture in which
lipids bind by malondialdehyde to protein fragmenta-tions. Age spots vary in form, scale, color, and degreeof protrusion in part of the skin. The skin ’sa g es p o t sare made up of the basal cells that bind to the basementmembrane in epidermis. The basal cells are the stemcells responsible for the regeneration and repair of epi-dermis in new epithelial cells. Basal cells and chemicalsubstances can be damaged by ultraviolet radiation andsome injured cells can survive and grow old byRathee et al.

misrepairs [ 77]. Age spot are treated by some skinlighting agents like kojic acid [ 78].An aged cell has two effects on a tissue, i.e., reducedneighborhood cell productivity in resolving environmen-tal changes and enhanced damage fragility; and de-creased local tissue repair performance. The adjacentcells in an old cell are thus at increased risk of injuryand misrepairs. Through this process, an aged cellcauses neighboring cells to age [ 77].Causes of hyperpigmentationHyper pigmentation is caused by many factors. Thesemay be exogenous and endogenous factor like endocri-nologic factor: Addison ’s disease, Cushing ’s syndrome,Nelson syndrome, Pheochromocytoma, Carcinoid, Acro-megaly, Hyperthyroidism, Acanthosis nigricans, Dia-betes. Nutritional factor: Kwashiorkor, Vitamin B 12deficiency [ 5,79], Folic acid deficiency, Niacin defi-ciency, Tryptophan deficiency, Vitamin A deficiency.Melasma is an undesirable skin effect on contraceptiveuse hormonal [ 76].
use hormonal [ 76].Treatment skin hyperpigmentation by herbsIn addition to photosafety, there are several medica-tions and treatments to treat hyperpigmentation ofthe skin of darker skin patients safely and efficientlywith some adverse reactions. So, herbs and phytocon-stituents are better choice for treatment for skinhyperpigmentation. Some he rbs with their mechanismof action for treatment of skin hyperpigmentation aregiven in Table 1. Hydroquinone, azelaic acid, kojicacid, liquoric extract, retin oids, etc., and treatmentslike chemexfoliation and laser therapy may be effect-ive on their own properties, or in combination withother drugs [ 78,80].The possible mechanisms of actions by which herbsare used for the treatment of skin hyper pigmentationare namely tyrosinase inhibitory, antioxidant, and skinwhitening effects.Tyrosinase inhibitory effectTyrosinase is a copper-containing enzyme which per-forms various functions, glycosylated, and found exclu-
sively in melanocytes [ 81]. It catalyzes conversion of L-tyrosine into L-DOPA which further converted intodopaquinone then dopachrom e[ 82]. Dopachrome poly-merizes to form melanin. Inhibition of tyrosinase en-zyme inhibit the melanin production which help toremove the skin hyperpigmentation. Extract of herbaldrugs like licorice, Aloe vera ,Vitex negundo ,Morus alba ,and many other drugs are used for inhibition of tyrosin-ase activity.Tyrosinase inhibitory effects were calculated by theformula:Percentage inhibitory effect¼hControl −Control blank ðÞ −Test−Test blank ðÞ/C2100=Control −Control blank ðÞiAntioxidantAntioxidants are substances that used to neutralize re-active oxygen species to prevent (for preventing) cellsand tissues from oxidative damage. The cutaneous anti-oxidant system includes enzymatic and non-enzymaticsubstances. Some enzymatic antioxidants like vitamin E,vitamin C, resveratrol, and lipoic acids. These molecules
perform removal of free radicals; neutralization of singletoxygen in the cell membrane; prevent lipid peroxidation,oxidative and mutagenic action to DNA inhibition; andrepair of endogenous antioxidant systems [ 83]. IC 50forresveratrol was 57.05 μg/mL, which demonstrated agreat tyrosinase inhibitory potency. But analog of kojicacid shows the most powerful tyrosinase inhibitor [IC 50= 28.66 μg/mL], two times more active than resveratrol[84]. Some herbs also show antioxidant effect which areused for the treatment of skin hyperpigmentation areAsphodelus microcarpus [42],Euphorbia supine [85],andPanax ginseng [42].Fig. 1 Symptoms of skin hyperpigmentation. aPost-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. bAcne produced PIH. cMelsama on face. dMelsama spot.eAge spots on faceRathee et al.

Skin whitening drugsPotency of skin whitening agents is due to phenoliccomponent present in the herbs. Arbutin is a naturaloccurring tyrosinase inhibitor which has skin whiten-ing property with IC 50value of 3.0 mM in HEMncells [ 81]. The most commonly used chemical agentsare hydroquinone [HQ], arbutin, kojic acid, liquid ni-trogen, laser treatment, chemical skinning, and supernatural dermabrasion [ 28]. Also, ascorbic acid and itsproducts and there are many of herbs or herbal ex-tract used as skin whitening agents are Syzygium aro-maticum ,Magnolia officinalis ,a n d Holarrhenaantidysentrica .Glycyrrhiza glabraGlycyrrhiza glabra extracts play a large role on the skinmainly as a result of its antioxidant activity, especially itsstrong antioxidant glycyrrhizin, triterpene saponins, andflavonoids. The main attributes are skin whitening, skindepigmentation, lightening of skin, anti-aging, anti-erythemic, emollient, anti-acne, and photoprotective ef-
fects [ 86]. Gabridin is present in the hydrophobic part ofthe root extract of Glycyrrhiza and it can reduce tyrosin-ase activity in culture on melanocytes and inhibit UVBinduction [ 86].The extract of licorice inhibits the tyrosinase activityby inhibiting oxidation of L-DOPA to an IC 50value of53μg/mL. Glabridin content has highest inhibition ac-tivity on tyrosinase. The highest inhibitory activity wasreported on the first oxidation of tyrosine with IC 50value of 0.9 μg/mL [ 87].Vitex negundoA poultice of this plant is used for the diagnosis ofhyperpigmentation as melasma or ephelides by localcosmetic practitioners. Negundin contains lactonefunctionally at C-2 position with potent IC 50value of10.06 mM against tyrosinase enzyme [ 16].Vitexnegundo is used as skin whitening agent, tyrosinaseinhibitor, and inhibit the synthesis of post inflamma-tory pigmentation [ 88].Vitex negundo contains anumber of chemical cons tituents, one of them isnegundin A.Aloe
negundin A.AloeThe leaf gel is used as a cure for minor burns and sun-burns [ 7] and Aloe vera gel mainly has antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective potential [ 89]. Theisolates of Aloe vera are barbaloin, aloesin, aglycone ofaloenin, 2 ′′-O-feruloyl aloesin, isoaloeresin D, and aloeresin E shows potent tyrosinase inhibitory properties.Lyophilized gel shows IC50 = 10.53 and 6.08 mg mL−1isfor methanolic extract. Aloesin shows highest inhibitionvalue than other molecules extracted form aloe [ 90].Morus albaFlavonoids present in Morus alba extract shows antioxi-dant and tyrosinase-inhibiting properties. Tyrosinase-inhibiting activity of mulberry extract is comparable withHQ and kojic acid [ 29]. Oxyresveratrol andMulberroside-A derived from M.alba root whichstrongly inhibit the monophenolase production and in-hibit mushroom tyrosinase activity in melanin synthesis[44]. They have properties of fever reduction, liver pro-
tection, and blood pressure lowering. The polyphenolsin the leaves have properties for depigmentation [ 86].Mulberroside F have 51.6% inhibition at 1 μg/mL con-centration on 0.29 μg/mL IC 50value [ 91].Rathee et al. Future Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences           (2021) 7:132 Page 6 of 14
Panax ginsengPanax ginseng is a herb containing various therapeut-ically active ginsenosides. P-Coumaric acid isolatedfrom Panax ginseng fresh leaves was used to inhibitL-tyrosine oxidation catalyzed by mushroom tyrosin-ase. The Panax ginseng berry isolates are Floralginse-noside [FGA], Ginsenoside [GRd], and GinsenosideRe [GRe].Of these 3, floralginsenoside [FGA] has been ob-served to have a powerful inhibitory effect on mela-nogenesis by means of reduced expression of themicrophthalmic-associated factor [ 3]. Ginseng ’si m -portance lies in its many pharmacological roles, suchas anticancer activity, as well as shows activity likeantioxidant, aging, antistre ss, and anti-fatigue. Due tothe free radical activity of DPPH, the potent antioxi-dant activity of PgAuNPs has been observed. Panaxginseng leaves also have skin whitening, skin-protective and moisture retention properties [ 13,21,22]. Extract of panax ginseng shows 3.65mM IC 50value [ 92].Gingko biloba
value [ 92].Gingko bilobaGinkgo biloba is a member of the Ginkgoaceae family.The G.biloba extract EGb 761, which contains, mostof it, quercetin and Kaempferol derivatives, and ter-pens [6%] from tree leaves, containing flavone glyco-sides [33%] which has shown capacity to minimizesunburn cells in mice from ultraviolet B (UVB) [ 93].Gingko shows anti-inflammatory, anti-vasculature,antioxidant, and tyrosinase properties [ 8]. Gingko isused to treat various medical problems such as poorcirculation of the blood, hypertension, poor memory,and depression [ 93]. The water extract of Gingkobiloba inhibit 50% of tyrosinase activity at 2.25 mg/mL IC 50. Also, ethanol and ethanol-ether mixture ex-tract shows 50% inhibitory activity at IC 50value 75and 0.32 mg/Ml respectively [ 94].Azadirachta indicaAzadirachta indica shows activity against tyrosinase en-zyme and also shows antioxidant and antibacterial prop-erties [ 95]. It contains isomeldenin, nimbin, nimbinene,
6-desacetyllnimbinene, nimbandiol, and Azadirachtin.Santalum albumSandalwood has many medicinal properties like anti-inflammatory, antiphlogistic, antiseptic, antispasmodic,carminative, diuretic, emollient, hypotensive, memorybooster, sedative, etc. [ 96]. Sandalwood oil has protect-ing, smoothening, moisturizing, hydrating, and skin anti-wrinkling properties. The oil inhibits the oxidative en-zyme 5-lipoxygenase and has DPPH radical scavengingactivity [ 24]. Alpha-santalol is the major ingredient ofsandalwood oil. In comparison to kojic acid and arbutin,it is a potent inhibitor of tyrosinase [IC 50= 171 μg/mL].Muntingia calaburaMuntingia calabura extracts are prepared in differentsolvents such as ethanol, aqueous, hydro-ethanol, petrol-eum ether using decoction methods with various partsof plant including leaves, flora, and fruits. This results inoptimum anti-thyrosinase and antioxidant activity in theleaf extract of Muntingia calabura in hydroethanol [ 25].
Plant extracts have an inhibitory effect on melanogene-sis. The human body ’s reactive oxygen species increasesthe damage done to DNA, the melanin biosynthesis, andthe melanocyte proliferation. M.calabura leaf hydro-ethanol shows 94.00 ± 1.97% inhibition of tyrosinaseenzymeBlumea balsamiferaBlumea balsamifera is a medicinal plant that belongs tothe Asteraceae family. The leaves are used for certainconditions such as rheumatism and high blood pressure.As part of the plant with different physiological activ-ities, its leaves have attracted attention, including plas-mine inhibitory, antifungal, and hepatroproof,antidiabetic, wound cure, angiogenic. In addition, anti-bacterium, free radical scavenging, inhibitory activity oflipid peroximization, xanthine ojidase inhibition, super-oxide scavenging activities, and antityrosinase activity
were identified in the methanol extracts of the leaves ofRathee et al. Future Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences           (2021) 7:132 Page 7 of 14
the plant [ 97]. Nine flavonoids are isolated from Blumeabalsamifera from ethyl acetate extract [ 25].Magnolia officinalisMagnolia officinalis [Magnoliaceae] has antispas-modic, anticancer, antioxida tive, and antidiabetic ac-tivities. The extract of plant Magnolia officinalisinhibits melanogenesis by a pre-translational regula-tion on tyrosinase gene expression. It also exhibitsdepigmenting activity. The fermented methanol barkextract shows antityrosinase activity and at a conc.of 200 μg/mL, it reduces 99.8% of melanin forma-tion [ 98,99].Pueraria thunbergianaP.thunbergiana root and flower have various medi-cinal properties. EtOAc- soluble extract fractionswere more effective than kojic acid, a whiteningagent used for positive control for a MSH-inducedmelanin synthesis. Tyrosinase specifically affected bythe aerial portion of P.thunbergiana [30]. Extrac-tion of root have % inhibition of tyrosinase at 1mg/mL, 2 mg/mL, and 4 mg/mL are 10.36%, 0.78%,
mg/mL, 2 mg/mL, and 4 mg/mL are 10.36%, 0.78%,13.22%, and 3.13% respectively [ 100].Emblica officinalisE.officinalis is recognized for its nutritional content. Awide range of chemicals are present, including flavonol-glycosides, carbohydrates, mucic acids, amino acids, ses-quiterpenoids, alkaloids, flavone glycosidses, phenolicglycosides, phenolic acids, and tannins. E.officinalis fruitjuice contains the highest amount of vitamin C and vita-min E as compared to other fruit juice. The extractcould inhibit tyrosinase, by inhibiting microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and Trp-1 geneexpression, but under low concentration of the extracttreatment would induce Trp-2 gene expression. EPE hashigher IC 50than the MPE; emblica fruit shows IC 504346.95 ± 166.23 μg/mL. Ethanolic extract has higherantioxidant and anti-melnogenesis effect [ 101,102].Curcuma longaCurcuma longa contains some active ingredient which
have tyrosinase inhibitory or depigmentry activity likecurcumin, demethylcurcumin, and bisdemethyl curcu-min. Among these, curcumin has the highest percentageof tyrosinase inhibition [ 23].Natural curcuminoides show potent inhibitory activ-ity as compared to synthetic curcumin analog. Curcu-min analog has higher tyrosinase activity withcompound o-diphenols and m-diphenols than othercompound. Tyrosinase activity is inhibited by curcu-minoids by inhibiting L-dopa oxidation [ 103]. Partiallypurified curcuma longa [PPC] inhibits the level oftyrosinase protein like MITF, TRP1, and also suppressthe α-MSH stimulated cells. Activation of ERK orPI3k/Akt in signaling pathway by suppressive mech-anism of PPC on melanogenesis [ 104].Camellia sinensisIt is commonly known as green tea. It belongs to theTheaceae family.

synthesis, and expression of melanogenic enzyme at theprotein and mRNA levels in melan-A cells were evalu-ated by researchers [ 105]. Green tea contains active in-gredients like -[-]-epigallocatechin-3-gallate[EGCG],[-]-epigallocatechin[EGC], [-]-catechin[C], [-]-gallocate-chingallate [GCG], and [-]-epicatechingallate [ECG].EGCG inhibit melanin production in mouse melanomacells. All active ingredients do not show potent inhibi-tory activity but EGCG and gallic acid show higher tyro-sinase inhibitory activity by cell proliferation. EGCG andGA also inhibit cell proliferation in cell line of K562 [hu-man leukemia cell] and 293T [human embryonic kidney][106]. Further, 6.2% of IC50 of methanol extract of seed[644.93 ± 1.44 μg/mL]. Methanol extract of pericarpshows 12 time stronger IC 50value than the methanol ex-tract of seed which is IC50 = 57.77 ± 0.34 μg/mL [ 107].Nelumbo nucifera GaertnFamily of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn is Nelumbonaceae.

Commonly, it is known as Indian lotus. Its seed andleaves extract contain alkaloids, saponine, and phenolswhich shows antioxidative activity against tissue oxida-tion. Lotus seed and leaves show protective effects onskin against UVB irradiation, anti-wrinkle effect, andskin whitening effect [ 35,108].Crocus sativus LIt is commonly known as saffron belonging to family Iri-daceae. The antioxidant activity of extract was 81% using70% ethanol. Crocus sativus decreases the melanin pig-ment from the skin. Emulsion is use in the cosmetic ormedicine preparation to treat skin hyperpigmentationand used as skin whitening agent [ 40]. Isorhamnetin-3,49-diglucoside has 55.7% at 2666.7 μm/mL concentra-tion with 1.84 mm IC 50[109].Rathee et al. Future Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences           (2021) 7:132 Page 8 of 14
Hemidesmus indicusIt belongs to family Asclepiadaceae and commonlyknown as Anantmul. H.indicus decreases the monophe-nols and diphenols activity of tyrosinase by inhibiting L-dopa to dopachrome synthesis in melanin production.Monophenolase activity inhibition by 2-hydroxy-4-meth-oxybenzaldehyde MBALD was studied with a substra-tum l-tyrosin e[ 39]. Hemidesminine, Lupeal, and vanillinare the active constituents which shows antioxidant ef-fect [ 40].Vitis viniferaThe main active ingredients of which are red vine leafextract (RVLE), contains many flavonoids. Deionizedwater was the solvent used in RVLE preparation. The so-lution RVLE showed the possibility of inhibiting dopa-chrome formation that can be observed at wavelength of475 nm with a spectrophotometer. The bioactive com-ponents of RVLE included gallic acid, chlorogenic acid,epicatechin, rutin, and resveratrol. RVLE solution is alsoused in cosmetic formulations as natural whitening
agent [ 52]. Extract of VVC is more potent then arbutinto inhibit tyrosinase activity and its has30 휇gm L−1IC50value [ 110].Euphorbia supinaThe ES extract has a non-cytotoxic effect on the prolif-eration of B16F10 cells. Clear cytotoxicity is observed inB16F10 cells at a concentration of 1000 μg/mL. The ESextract showed an occurrence of 93.05 ± 0.6% at 200 μg/mL almost equivalent to ascorbic acid. ES extracts had arelatively high ABTS+ radical scavenge activities of 8and 40 μg/mL [ 14]; protocatechuic acid, nodakenin, and3-O-glucoside are the chemical constituent present intheEuphorbia supina [111].Acacia catechuThe extract has recorded high tyrosinase inhibition ac-tivity at a concentration of 120 μg/ml, with an inhibitionpercentage of 61.58 compared to a positive kojic acidregulation [98.73% inhibition] at a concentration equiva-lent to 120 μg/ml. Without preservative, A.catechuwhitening cream has maintained strong stability for 3months [ 46].Carica papaya
months [ 46].Carica papayaIt contains papain, chymopapain A and B which showsantioxidant activity. It also contains calcium, sugar, fiber,vitamin C, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, amino acid, caro-tene, and malic acids. It also includes proteins and fats[45]. It has been found that carica fruit extract is having87% of antioxidant activity. The phenolic compounds inpapaya fruit contained two major groups. The most im-portant natural antioxidant groups are these phenoliccompounds [ 111].Arnica montana3β,16β-Dihydroxy-21a-hydroperoxy-20[30]-tariaxasten isa compound present in Arnica montana that is found tobe 50 times stronger than 4-methoxyphenol, a com-monly used depigmenting agent; it inhibited in the mel-anin biosynthesis, without affecting cells production andmuch stronger than arbutin as well. At 0.125 mg/mL,Arnica flowers inhibit melanin synthesis in 80% ethanolextract [ 47].Artemisia dracunculusUndeca-2E,4E-dien-8,10-dynoic acid isobutylamide and
piperidylamide are two active compounds found in Arte-misia dracunculus . These compounds inhibit mediatedmelanin production in B16 cells of mouse melanoma po-tently by inhabitation of melanocyte-stimulating hor-mone [-MSH]. Consequently, the cytotoxicity was notrelated to the inhibitor activity of compounds 1 and 2against melanin biosynthesis [ 48].Thymelaea hirsutaT.hirsuta extract shows a time-dependent decrease incytoplasmic accumulation of melanin and do notshow any cytotoxicity effect . Genkwadaphnin and gni-dicin are the active constituents in the extract of T.hirsuta which shows effect against melanin synthesis.By ERK1/2 phosphorylation, melanogenesis effect onB16 cells are decreases. Inhibition of melanin produc-tion by downregulation of tyrosinase by Thymelaeahirsuta [112].Betula pendulaIn addition to metal chelating, Betula pendula is a sig-nificant source of strong depigmentants with an effecton tyrosinase to decrease and scavenge properties.

Then, 30.21 ± 0.23%of tyrosinase inhibitory effect were observed at 80 μg/mL concentration on 119.08 ± 2.04 μg/mL IC 50[113].Caesalpinia sappanHomoisoflavanone, sappanone A are isolated from the ex-tract of Caesalpinia sappan . The crude extract has dem-onstrated highest melanogenesis inhibitory activity inmouse B16 melanoma cells and crude extract of C.sappanhas been evaluated in a previous study for antiproliferatingactivity in B16 melanoma cells. Homoisoflavanones are asmall class of oxygen that occur naturally. Sapanone Ashows a dose-dependent inhibition of melanogenesis [ 52].Callicarpa longissimaCallicarpa longissima inhibits the development of mel-anin by suppressing the MITF [microphthalmia-associ-ated transcription factor] gene expression of the B16F10mouse melanoma cells. Carnosol is present in the ex-tract of Callicarpa longissimi which has oxidative prop-
erty and carnosol and carnosic acid are responsible forinhibiting melanin synthesis [ 53].Phytoconstituents used for the treatment of skinhyperpigmentation are given in Table 2.ConclusionIn this review, we discussed many of herbs and phyto-constituent which are used as tyrosinase inhibitor andalso as skin whitening agents. Skin is the most importantpart of our body. The colour of skin is determined bythe presence of melanin in the skin. Melanin is a pig-ment present in skin which is responsible for the skincolor in plants and mammals. When the amount of mel-anin is increased in the skin, then it causes hyper-pigmentation on the skin. Synthesis of melanin dependsmainly on tyrosinase enzyme. It convert L-tyrosine in L-DOPA and L-DOPA to dopaquinone by which melaninis produced in the epidermis layer of skin and affect theskin color. Plants like Azadiracta indica ,Glycyrrhizaglabra ,Panax ginseng and genistein, ellagic acids, quer-
cetin, and many other phytoconstituents which are usedin herbal cosmetic as anti-hyperpigmentry agents in cos-metic industries. Some of flavonoids and triterpenoidspresent in these herbs show their effect as antioxidantand skin whitening agents.AbbreviationsMITF: Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor; ROS: Reactive oxygenspecies; MPAK: Mitogen-activated protein kinase; COX: Cyclooxygenase;DHICA: Dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid; HQ: Hydroquinone; PPC: Purifiedcurcuma longa; RVLE: Red vine leaf extract; PPO: Polyphenol oxidaseAcknowledgementNot applicable.Table 2 Phytoconstituents for the treatment of skin hyperpigmentation (Continued)S.No. Phytoconstituent CommonsourceStructure Traditional use Reference11 9-Hydroxy-4-methoxypsoralenAngelicadahuricaTyrosinase inhibitor [ 124]12 Kuraridin SophoraflavescensTyrosinase inhibitor [ 125]13 p-Coumaric Acid Arachis
