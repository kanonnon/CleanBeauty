nature medicine  VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 6 | JUNE 2012  883a r t i c l e sExosomes are small membrane vesicles (30–100 nm) derived from the luminal membranes of multivesicular bodies and constitutively released by fusion with the cell membrane1–5. In addition to diffusible factors, such as cytokines, growth factors and extracellular matrix molecules, exosomes mediate local and systemic cell communica -tion through the horizontal transfer of information, such as mRNAs, microRNAs and proteins2,5–15.It is well recognized that bone marrow–derived cells (BMDCs) are crucial for the generation of a suitable microenvironment for the pri -mary tumor and the development of metastasis16 through a process called pre-metastatic niche formation17,18. Although secreted factors are known contributors to BMDC recruitment to both the primary tumor and to pre-metastatic niches18–21, the role of exosomes in this
18–21, the role of exosomes in this process has not been evaluated. Exosomes may have a role in the crosstalk between the primary tumor and BMDCs, leading to the homing of both cell types to sites of metastasis7,22,23.Here we identify tumor-derived exosomes as new factors that promote metastatic niche formation by educating BMDCs toward a pro-vasculogenic and pro-metastatic phenotype through upregu -lation of the MET oncoprotein24–29. Our data show that a specific expression pattern of Ras-related (Rab) proteins30,31 is associated with exosome production in melanoma. Moreover, using circulating exosomes isolated from subjects with stage 4 melanoma, we define a melanoma-specific exosome signature comprised of tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TYRP2), very late antigen 4 (VLA-4), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), an HSP90 isoform and the MET oncoprotein. Notably, exosomal TYRP2 predicts disease progression in subjects with stage 3 melanoma. We also show that CD45−C-KITlow/+TIE2+

We explored the function of melanoma-derived exosomes in the formation of primary tumors and metastases in mice and human subjects. Exosomes from highly metastatic melanomas increased the metastatic behavior of primary tumors by permanently ‘educating’ bone marrow progenitors through the receptor
tyrosine kinase MET. Melanoma-derived exosomes also induced vascular leakiness at pre-metastatic sites and reprogrammed bone marrow progenitors toward a pro-vasculogenic phenotype that was positive for c-Kit, the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 and Met. Reducing Met expression in exosomes diminished the pro-metastatic behavior of bone marrow cells. Notably, MET expression was elevated in circulating CD45−C-KITlow/+TIE2+ bone marrow progenitors from individuals with metastatic melanoma. RAB1A , RAB5B , RAB7  and RAB27A , regulators of membrane trafficking and exosome formation, were highly expressed in melanoma cells. Rab27A  RNA interference decreased exosome production, preventing bone marrow education and reducing, tumor growth and metastasis. In addition, we identified an exosome-specific melanoma signature with prognostic and therapeutic potential comprised of TYRP2, VLA-4, HSP70, an HSP90 isoform and the MET oncoprotein. Our data show that exosome production,
transfer and education of bone marrow cells supports tumor growth and metastasis, has prognostic value and offers promise for new therapeutic directions in the metastatic process.npg © 2016 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

Our study shows that the MET oncoprotein is upregulated in bone marrow progenitor cells by tumor-derived exosomes, possibly by both direct and indirect mech -anisms, promoting the education, mobilization and pro-metastatic behavior of BMDCs.RESULTSExosomal proteins have diagnostic and prognostic valueTo determine the relevance of circulating exosome concentrations in metastatic melanoma32,33, we prospectively isolated and charac -terized exosomes from the plasma of human subjects with different clinical stages of melanoma. We isolated exosomes (100 nm particles) from plasma using standard methods and confirmed their identity by electron microscopy ( Fig. 1 a). We confirmed the presence of known exosome markers, including CD63, CD9 and major histocompatibility
complex class I (MHC-I) (data not shown). Exosome number and size distribution quantified by NanoSight analysis did not differ based on clinical stage ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). In contrast, exosome protein concentrations were higher in subjects with stage 4 disease compared to all other stages and to normal controls ( Supplementary Fig. 1b ). Furthermore, we found that individuals with stage 4 disease who had protein-poor exosomes (<50 µg ml−1) had a survival advantage com -pared to those individuals with stage 4 disease who had protein-rich exosomes (>50 µg ml−1) (Fig. 1 b).Exosomes from highly metastatic mouse (B16-F10) and human (SK-Mel-28, SK-Mel-202, SK-Mel-265 and SK-Mel-35) melanoma cell lines expressed typical exosome markers ( Supplementary Fig.  1c and data not shown). We used mass spectrometry to identify additional human- and mouse-derived melanoma exosome proteins ( Supplementary Table 1 ) that helped define a potential diagnostic signature for
melanoma. Compared to control subjects, the amounts of TYRP2  (a melanoma-specific protein), VLA-4 and HSP70 were increased in the exosomes of subjects with stage 4 disease ( Fig. 1c ,d), whereas only TYRP2 was significantly higher ( P < 0.05) in exosomes from subjects with stage 3 disease ( Fig. 1c ,d). Notably, 70% of subjects with stage 4 melanoma had exosomes that contained an isoform of HSP90, which has been reported to be key in cellular transformation34 (Fig. 1 c). In a retrospective analysis of individuals with stage 3 melanoma, we found that the amount of exosomal TYRP2 was significantly increased  (P < 0.001) in individuals who eventually developed metastatic disease (Fig. 1 e and data not shown). These data support analyzing circulat -ing exosomes in patients to predict stage, prognosis (stage 3) and survival in subjects with metastatic disease.Tumor exosomes alter organ tropism and metastatic potential
Exosomes from the highly malignant B16-F10, SK-Mel-28 and SK-Mel-202 melanoma cell lines expressed higher amounts (twofold to 20-fold) of protein than exosomes from poorly metastatic (B16-F1)35 and nonmetastatic cell lines (melan-a) ( Fig. 2 a). Other less metastatic lung, breast and colon cancer cells also secreted lower amounts of exosomal proteins than B16-F10 cells ( Supplementary Fig. 2a ). To analyze the tissue distribution of the exosomes, we injected fluores -cently labeled B16-F10 exosomes intravenously into naive mice. We detected the injected exosomes in the blood vessels of target organs  5 min later ( Fig. 2 b). Twenty-four hours after injection, we found  B16-F10 exosomes in the interstitium of the lungs and in the bone marrow ( Fig. 2 b), livers and spleens of the mice (organotropic sites for B16-F10 metastasis) but not in the circulation ( Supplementary Table  2 and data not shown).

in the lung, an early event in pre-metastatic niche formation36, we injected B16-F10 exosomes into mice, followed by injection of fluores -cently labeled dextran 24 h later. The B16-F10 exosomes enhanced the lung endothelial permeability in the mice, as judged by the presence of extravasated dextran, compared to mice injected with conditioned media, control particles ( Fig. 2 c) or exosomes from nonmetastatic cell lines ( Supplementary Fig. 2b ).To investigate the molecular pathways affected by exosome deliv -ery, we performed gene expression profiling of lung tissue 24 h and 48 h after injecting B16-F10 exosomes into the tail veins of mice (Supplementary Fig. 2c ).

Many of these genes were related to extracellular matrix remodeling and inflammation, such as the genes encoding heat-shock proteins, as well as S100A8  and S100A9  (Supplementary Table 3 ), which are known effectors of pre-metastatic niche formation37; we confirmed these findings by quantitative real time PCR ( Supplementary Fig. 2d ). TNFA  was upregulated 24 h after exosome injection ( Supplementary Fig. 2d ), suggesting that it could be involved in early events during the metastatic process (for example, vascular permeability)38.To further examine the role of tumor exosomes in primary tumor growth and metastasis, we intravenously injected mice with B16-F10–derived exosomes three times a week, starting 7 d after orthotopic injection of B16-F10mCherry cells. In contrast to the mice injected
with control particles who had no evidence of micrometastatic disease, mice treated with exosomes showed lung micrometastasis at day 19  after tumor cell injection ( Fig. 2 d). Primary tumor growth was only enhanced in the exosome-injected mice 24 days after tumor cell injec -tion ( Fig. 2 d). To analyze the differences between exosomes from highly compared to poorly metastatic melanomas, we injected equal and physiological concentrations of B16-F10– and B16-F1–derived exosomes intravenously ( Supplementary Fig. 3a ) into mice three times a week over 28 d, then subcutaneously implanted B16-F10 cells expressing luciferase (Online Methods). The exosome treatment did not affect primary tumor growth ( Fig. 2 e). However, mice injected with B16-F10 exosomes had a greater metastatic burden in the lungs (240-fold increase, as measured by luciferase intensity; Fig.  2f) com -pared to mice injected with control particles or mice treated with
exosomes derived from the poorly metastatic B16-F1 cells ( Fig. 2 f). Furthermore, mice treated with B16-F10 exosomes developed meta -stasis with a greater tissue distribution, which included bone ( Fig. 2 f) and brain (data not shown), compared to either control-treated mice or B16-F1–exosome treated mice. These data suggest that qualitative  differences in exosome content can mediate metastatic potential  and organotropism.Tumor exosomes enhance metastasis by bone marrow education Given the key role of BMDCs in metastatic progression17,39, we deter -mined whether tumor-derived exosomes could educate BMDCs and influence metastatic progression (Fig. 3 a and Online Methods). We transplanted lethally irradiated C57BL/6 mice with bone  marrow from GFP-expressing mice that we had previously treated with  B16-F10 exosomes (educated bone marrow) for 28 d or with synthetic exosomes or PBS (control bone marrow). After bone marrow reconsti -
tution, we subcutaneously implanted the C57BL/6 mice with B16-F10 cells expressing mCherry. The mice transplanted with exosome-  educated bone marrow had greater primary tumor growth than the mice transplanted with control bone marrow ( Fig. 3 b), indicating that pre-education of bone marrow cells with tumor exosomes was sufficient to accelerate tumor growth. The recruitment of BMDCs and tumor vascular density were enhanced by approximately 4.5-fold and threefold, respectively, in the primary tumors of mice transplanted with educated bone marrow compared with tumors of mice trans -planted with control bone marrow ( Fig. 3 c).After 28 days, we found an increase in the size and number of metastases at both typical (lungs and ipsilateral lymph nodes) and atypical (contralateral lymph nodes, mesentery and brain) sites in mice transplanted with exosome-educated bone marrow as compared to mice transplanted with control bone marrow ( Supplementary
Table 4 ). Mice transplanted with educated bone marrow had a three -fold increase in metastatic burden, larger metastatic lesions in the
Table 4 ). Mice transplanted with educated bone marrow had a three -fold increase in metastatic burden, larger metastatic lesions in the lung and a twofold elevation in the number of metastasis-associated BMDCs as compared to mice transplanted with control bone marrow 2.0a bcdCD31  ExosomesDAPIDextran  DAPImCherry DAPIExosomesLungControlConditionedmediumLung metastasesB16-F10mCherryB16-F10mCherry +exoB16-F10 exoBone marrow1.51.0Total protein exosomes(µg) per 106 cellsTumor volume (cm3)Micrometastasis perlung section 0.52.52.01.51.00.502.01.51.00.500 5 10 15Time (d)20 25 ControlExoDay 190Mouse HumanPrimary tumorB16-F10mCherry +control exoB16-F10mCherry +B16-F10 exo*Melan-aB16-F1B16-F10SK-Mel-28SK-Mel-202e fControlTumor volume (cm3)2.52.01.51.00.50ControlB16-F10 exo B16-F10exo B16-F1 exoB16-F1exoP < 0.05LungsLung photon fluxBone photon flux2.2 × 1061.2 × 1061.5 × 1051 × 1042.5 × 1035 × 1035 × 103Bones

Notably, BMDCs were present in metastatic (mCherry+) and nonmetastatic regions (mCherry−) in mice transplanted with exosome-educated bone marrow, although in the metastatic areas, the number of BMDCs per area was higher ( Supplementary Fig.  3b). Moreover, education of bone marrow cells with B16-F10 exosomes also increased primary tumor growth 1.3-fold and metastatic  burden tenfold in less metastatic models such as Lewis lung carcinoma (Supplementary Fig. 4 ), showing a crucial role for bone marrow cell education by tumor exosomes in regulating tumor metastasis.To further define the mechanisms of the exosome education of BMDCs, we analyzed the effect of B16-F10 and B16-F1 exosomes on bone marrow progenitor cells. Twenty-eight days of B16-F10 exo -some treatment in mice led to a twofold increase in the frequency of pro-angiogenic c-Kit+Tie2+ cells in the bone marrow, whereas
c-Kit+Sca1+ hematopoietic stem cells were not affected by exosome treatment ( Fig. 3 e). Exosome education did not affect other bone marrow–derived cell populations, including CD11b+, CD11b+Gr1+, F4/80+ or VEGFR1+ cells (data not shown), which are commonly mobilized by growth factors and chemokines18,21,37.Transfer of exosomal MET to bone marrow progenitorsExosomes are known to promote the horizontal transfer of molecules to recipient cells8,13,40. Given the differential effects of B16-F1 compared to B16-F10 exosomes on metastatic potential together with previous studies suggesting differences in B16-F10 and B16-F1 membrane-derived vesicles41, we identified proteins that were highly expressed in the B16-F10 exosomes but that were present in much lower amounts in the B16-F1 exosomes by proteomic profiling ( Supplementary Table  5). Some candidates with known roles in tumorigenesis and
metastasis include the Met oncoprotein, CD44, Hsp70 and annexin A6  (refs. 24,42). Given the key role of MET signaling in migration, inva -sion, angiogenesis and bone marrow cell mobilization24,25,43,44, we focused our functional analyses on this proto-oncogene. We hypothe -sized that exosomes could horizontally transfer MET from melanoma to bone marrow progenitor cells and that this transfer could be a pre -viously unknown mechanism for promoting metastatic progression. We verified that the amounts of Met and phosphorylated Met (pMet) were greater in both B16-F10 exosomes and cells compared to B16-F1  exosomes and cells, respectively ( Fig. 4 a). After 28 d of exosome education, Met expression was increased in bone marrow progenitor cells from mice injected with B16-F10 exosomes ( Fig. 4 b) but not in mice injected with the B16-F1 exosomes. Notably, Cd44  expression in BMDCs was not affected by treatment with either B16-F10 or B16-F1
exosomes ( Fig. 4 b). These data suggest that exosome-mediated Met transfer is partially responsible for increased Met expression in bone marrow progenitor cells.To determine the functional consequences of Met expression within exosomes, we reduced the amount of Met expression in B16-F10 tumor cells by 40% and the amount of pMet by 80% using Met shRNAs (B16-F10shMet; Supplementary Fig. 5a ). Using fluorescently labeled exo -somes isolated from B16-F10, B16-F10shMet and B16-F1 cells, we found a sixfold increase in c-Kit+Met+ bone marrow progenitors after treating bone marrow cells with B16-F10 exosomes as compared to treating cells with B16-F10shMet, B16-F1 exosomes or control parti -cles ( Fig. 4 c and Supplementary Fig. 5b ). Notably, exosome uptake quantified by flow cytometry was similar regardless of exosome origin and Met expression ( Fig. 4 c). To determine whether B16-F10 exosomes contribute to activation of the MET pathway in BMDCs, we analyzed

Pretreatment of bone marrow cells with B16-F10 exosomes resulted in HGF-induced S6 and ERK phosphorylation, which was not seen in nontreated bone marrow or bone marrow pretreated with B16-F1 exosomes ( Supplementary Fig. 5c ). Additionally, we observed that a MET inhibitor (crizotinib) prevented HGF-induced phosphorylation of S6 kinase and ERK after treatment with B16-F10 exosomes, showing the specificity of this pathway (data not shown).We then investigated the functional consequences of exosome-mediated MET signaling in bone marrow progenitor cells. Injection with B16-F10, but not B16-F1, exosomes increased Met expression in vasculogenic (c-Kit+Tie2+) and hematopoietic (c-Kit+Sca1+)
progenitors in the circulation but not in the bone marrow ( Fig. 4 d, highlighted in red, and Supplementary Fig. 5d ), suggesting that Met expression enhanced bone marrow cell mobilization. We made simi -lar observations in mice transplanted with B16-F10 educated bone marrow, as described in Figure 3 (data not shown). These data sug -gest that Met expression enhances bone marrow cell mobilization.

Moreover, the amounts of vasculogenic and hematopoietic precursors were lower in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of mice bearing B16-F10 tumors that were injected with B16-F10shMet exosomes compared to mice treated with B16-F10 exosomes (data not shown).To determine the clinical relevance of our findings, we analyzed the amounts of MET and pMET in circulating exosomes isolated from subjects with stage 3 or 4 melanoma (from the same cohort as described in Fig. 1). We found higher amounts of total and pMET in both the individuals with stage 3 melanoma and those with stage 4  melanoma compared to normal controls ( Fig. 4 f). Moreover, MET  protein expression analyzed by flow cytometry was higher in both bone marrow progenitor cells (CD45−C-KITlow/+) and pro -vasculogenic
cells (CD45−C-KIT+/lowTIE2+) isolated from the blood of subjects with stage 4 disease compared to cells isolated from control subjects with stage 1–3 disease ( Fig. 4 g and Supplementary Fig. 5e ). Our data suggest that MET expression in circulating exosomes and bone marrow progenitor cells could be new predictors or early markers  of metastatic disease.Rab27a regulates exosome production and metastasisAs Ras-related RAB proteins control exosome biogenesis30, we analyzed the expression of RAB  genes ( RAB1A , RAB5A , RAB5B , RAB7 , RAB27A  and RAB27B ) using a panel of 39 human-derived melanoma cell lines. Notably, those cell lines producing high concentrations of exosomes also had high expression of RAB27A , RAB5B  and RAB7  mRNA relative to those cell lines producing lower concentrations of exosomes (Fig. 5a,b). Given the key role of RAB27  in exosome release31, we reasoned that
inactivating this gene would reduce exosome production. We selected the Rab27a  isoform for knockdown, as it was selectively expressed in melanoma-derived cell lines ( Fig. 5 a and data not shown). We effec -tively reduced the expression of Rab27a  in B16-F10 and SK-Mel-28 cells (Fig. 5c), which resulted in a 50% decrease in exosome secretion ( Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 6a), showing a role for Rab27a in exosome production by melanoma cells. Although we found no marked differ -ences in total protein, protein content, exosome-specific markers or the amount of Met and pMet between the control and RAb27a  knockdown cells and exosomes ( Supplementary Fig. 6b ,c), we did find a decrease in the secretion of placental growth factor 2 (PlGF-2), platelet-derived growth factor A chain homodimer (PDGF-AA) and osteopontin as a consequence of reducing the expression of Rab27a (Fig. 5 e). Notably, Rab27a  knockdown in B16-F10 and SK-Mel-28 cells reduced primary
tumor growth, lung colonization and metastasis (Fig. 5 f), which were associated with a decrease in the number of BMDCs recruited to these sites ( Fig. 5 g and Supplementary Fig.  6d). Consistent with our in vitro  results ( Supplementary Fig. 6a ), the concentrations of circulating tumor-derived exosomes in mice bearing Rab27a  knockdown tumors were reduced by 40–50 % (data not shown) and were therefore insuf -ficient to educate and mobilize BMDCs.By injecting increasing amounts of exosomes isolated from either B16-F10shScramble (B16-F10 cells plus scramble shRNA) or B16-F10shRab27a (B16-F10 cells plus Rab27a shRNA) cell lines in mice fol -lowed by flank injection of tumor cells, we observed a dose-dependent increase in metastatic burden ( Supplementary Fig. 7a ,b). These data suggest that quantitative differences in exosome production can alter metastatic potential. Because overexpression of Rab27a in the B16-F1,
LLC and B16-F10 cell lines led to cell death (data not shown), we were unable to determine the sufficiency of Rab27a in exosome production
LLC and B16-F10 cell lines led to cell death (data not shown), we were unable to determine the sufficiency of Rab27a in exosome production and modulating metastasis. Collectively, these data suggest that Rab27a  knockdown in melanoma models reduces exosome production and circulating exosome concentrations, thus preventing the recruitment of the BMDCs that are necessary for metastatic progression.DISCUSSIONAccumulating evidence indicates that exosomes are mediators of metastasis3,11,13,15,22,23,45,46. Multiple cell types, including fibr oblasts, endothelial cells and bone marrow progenitor cells, contribute to the generation of metastatic microenvironments39,47 and may be influ -enced by the horizontal transfer of molecules (for example, proteins and microRNAs) by exosomes8,40,48,49. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this association have not been determined. Here we show that exosomes have a role in tumor pro -
gression and metastatic niche formation that is distinct from that of tumor-derived growth factors, extracellular proteins and chemo -kines18,20,21,37,50,51. Tumor-derived exosomes promote the education and mobilization of BMDCs that support tumor vasculogenesis, inva -sion and metastasis. Notably, tumor-derived exosomes recruit BMDCs through upregulation of proinflammatory molecules at pre-metastatic sites. Specifically, preconditioning the bone marrow with exosomes from a highly metastatic cancer cell line (B16-F10) can increase the metastatic tumor burden and distribution in target tissues, even for tumors of different origins with a low metastatic capacity. Our work in tumor-derived exosome biology complements Paget and Ewing’s theories of metastatic spread, offering an explanation of organotropic involvement in certain metastatic diseases52,53.By comparing the protein content of exosomes from highly meta -
static and poorly metastatic melanoma cells, we identified MET signaling as a principal mediator of bone marrow progenitor cell edu -cation. We identified activated MET-related signaling proteins to be differentially expressed in exosomes from highly metastatic melanoma cells compared to poorly metastatic ones, which mediated pro- vasculogenic and metastatic effects on bone marrow progenitor cells. The MET oncogene mediates cellular transformation and tumor cell proliferation, survival, motility, invasion and metastasis26,28,29,44,54,55. Here we propose a previously unknown role for exosome-packaged MET in metastatic melanoma. The unique cargo of exosomes from other tumor types may educate distinct bone marrow populations, thus directly affecting metastatic propensity and outcome. The bone  marrow of mice educated with the poorly metastatic B16-F1 exo -somes, which lack the MET receptor, reduced (though not statisti -
cally significant) the metastatic burden and organotropism of highly metastatic B16-F10 primary tumors, suggesting that nonmetastatic exosomes may educate bone marrow to prevent metastatic disease.The molecular mechanisms of exosome biogenesis and secretion are not well described. We found that, among the 39 melanoma-derived cell lines studied, specific RAB genes involved in  exosome secretion ( RAB1A , RAB5B , RAB7  and RAB27A ) were highly expressed in cells lines secreting high concentrations of exosomes. Reducing the expression of RAB27A, a regulator of protein traffick -ing and melanoma proliferation31,56, decreased exosome production  and the release of proangiogenic factors (PlGF-2, osteopontin and PDGF-AA) from tumor cells, hindering BMDC mobilization, tumor growth and metastasis. Our data, together with other studies showing that overexpression of RAB27A correlates with breast cancer invasive -ness and metastasis57,58, suggest that RAB27A should be considered

We found that the coexpression of TYRP2 and MET in exosomes, as well as an increased amount of protein per exosome, predicted disease progression. In addition, we showed that MET expression is elevated in circulating pro-vasculogenic progenitors in subjects with metastatic melanoma. Thus, our work identifies quantitative and qualitative signatures, along with specific bone marrow progenitor cell populations that are mobilized, as representative hallmarks of metastatic melanoma.Although the membrane vesicles of cancer cells have been sug -gested to contribute to the horizontal propagation of oncoproteins and genetic material (RNA)5,8,13,14,40,48, our study is the first, to our knowledge, to show that transfer of the MET oncoprotein from tumor-derived exosomes to bone marrow progenitor cells promotes
the metastatic process in vivo . Notably, we show that exosomes can alter the bone marrow in a durable manner; these results suggest that genetic or epigenetic changes could be involved in this phenomenon, as bone marrow cells retain the educated phenotype after engraftment into a new host.Here we propose a new mechanism that controls metastatic pro -gression through the crosstalk between tumor-derived exosomes and bone marrow progenitor cells. Collectively, our data identify exosome-mediated transfer of the oncoprotein MET as a key regulator of bone marrow education and mobilization and metastatic progression.METHODSMethods and any associated references are available in the online version of the pape r.Accession codes.

nature medicine doi:10.1038/nm.2753ONLINE METHODSExosome purification and tracking analysis.  Cells were cultured in media sup -plemented with 10% exosome-depleted FBS (FBS, Hyclone). FBS was depleted of bovine exosomes by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 70 min. Supernatant fractions collected from 48–72 h cell cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min. Exosomes were then harvested by centrifugation at 100,000 g for 70 min. The exosome pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of PBS and collected by ultracen -trifugation at 100,000 g for 70 min (Sorvall SureSpin 630 rotor). Circulating exosomes were isolated from mouse and human plasma as described above, with an additional filtration through 1.2- µm nylon filters (GE) before the last step of ultracentrifugation. For centrifugation onto sucrose cushions, the samples were diluted 1:10 in PBS after centrifugation at 20,000 g and then collected by
ultracentrifugation (100,000 g for 70 min) on a 40% sucrose cushion. The floating exosome fraction was collected again by ultracentrifugation as described above, and the final pellet was resuspended in PBS. For the retrospective studies using frozen plasma, 2 ml of cell-free plasma was centrifuged at 500 g for 10  min, and then the supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min. Exosomes were then harvested by centrifugation at 100,000 g for 70 min. The exosome pellet was resuspended in PBS and collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for  70 min (Sorvall S100-AT5 rotor). The LM10 nanoparticle characterization  system (NanoSight) equipped with a blue laser (405 nm) was used for real-time characterization of the vesicles.Human studies.  Human peripheral blood samples were obtained from sub -jects with stage 1–4 melanoma at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
(MSKCC) and had histologically confirmed melanoma. For the retrospective studies of circulating exosomes in frozen plasma, subjects with stage 3 disease were followed up for 1–4 years. Subjects with stage 4 disease were followed up over 42 months. All individuals provided informed consent for blood donation according to a protocol approved by the institutional review board of MSKCC.Exosome labeling and treatment.  Five to ten micrograms of total exosome pro -tein were injected by tail vein in a total volume of 100–200 µl PBS. Synthetic unilamellar 100-nm liposomes (Encapsula Nanoscience) or PBS were used as control particles in all studies (data not shown). For the exosome-tracking experi -ments, purified exosomes were fluorescently labeled using PKH67 membrane dye (Sigma). Labeled exosomes were washed in 20 ml of PBS, collected by ultracen -
trifugation as described above and resuspended in PBS. We verified that no dye contamination occurred in the PKH67-labeled exosome preparations by ultracen -trifugation on 40% sucrose cushions as described above (data not shown).Metastasis and lung colonization studies.  To analyze the role of exosomes in tumor metastasis, 8- to 10-week-old C57BL/6J female mice were injected in the flank with 1 × 106 B16-F10mCherry cells. Seven days later, 10 µg of B16-F10 exosomes were injected three times a week for 3 weeks. Metastasis was evaluated by mCherry expression at days 19 and 28. Alternatively, C57BL/6J female mice were injected three times a week with the indicated dose of  B16-F10 or B16-F1 exosomes for 28 d. After exosome injection, mice received  1 × 106 B16-F10–luciferase subcutaneous flank injections. Controls included
injections of PBS and synthetic unilamellar liposomes. Luciferase imaging was performed using the IVIS Spectrum system (Caliper, Xenogen). Tumor-bearing mice were anesthetized (using isoflurane and O2), and D-luciferin (50 mg kg−1 in 100 µl PBS) was administered. Five minutes later, mice were
2), and D-luciferin (50 mg kg−1 in 100 µl PBS) was administered. Five minutes later, mice were euthanized and their organs were analyzed for luciferase expression. Data were quantified with Living Imaging software 4.2. For the analysis of tumor cell growth using Rab27a  knockdown cells, 1 × 106 B16-F10–mCherry cells (in 100 µl of PBS) or 2 × 106 SK-Mel-28mCherry cells (in a mix of 1:1 serum-free RPMI and growth-factor–reduced Matrigel) were injected in the flank of C57BL/6 or nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient female mice, respectively. For lung colonization experiments, 1 × 105 B16-F10–mCherry cells or 5 × 105 SK-Mel-28–mCherry cells (in 100 µl of PBS) were injected by tail vein in C57BL/6 female mice.GFP bone marrow education. Enhanced GFP (eGFP) transgenic male mice (C57BL/6-TgN(ActbeGFP)1Osb/J, Jackson Laboratory) were injected three times a week with 10 µg of B16-F10 exosomes over 28 d. Bone marrow was
harvested by flushing the femurs and tibias of eGFP donor mice, and the 5 × 106  total bone marrow cells from the eGFP donor mice were transplanted into lethally irradiated (950 rads) C57BL/6 female mice by retro-orbital injection. After  4 weeks, the eGFP bone marrow–reconstituted C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously in the flank with 1 × 106 B16-F10mCherry or LLCmCherry cells. Mice were euthanized after 28 d or 35 d. Tissues were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) or in a mix of 2% PFA and 20% sucrose solution overnight and embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and then the blocks were frozen in a dry ice and ethanol bath. Additionally,  tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA and protein extraction. The tissues used to evaluate metastasis in bone marrow–educated mice and controls (Supplementary Table 4 ) were paraffin embedded and stained with H&E, and
metastases were evaluated by microscopy. All mouse work was performed in accordance with institutional, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and American Association for Laboratory Animal Science (AALAS) guidelines. All mice were monitored for abnormal tissue growth or ill effects according to AALAS guidelines and were euthanized if excessive deterioration of the health of the mice was observed.Mouse flow cytometry and antibodies.  Lungs and tissues were prepared for flow cytometry by mincing, followed by digestion at 37 °C for 45–60 min with an enzyme cocktail (Collagenase A and DNaseI, Roche). Single-cell suspen -sions were filtered through a 70- µm strainer. Peripheral blood was obtained
by retro-orbital bleeding directly into anti-coagulant tubes (EDTA), and red blood cells were lysed using ACK lysis buffer (Gibco). Cell suspensions were blocked with Fc-block (CD16/CD32, BD), washed in PBS and 1% BSA and incubated with the following primary antibodies diluted in PBS and 1% BSA: CD11b-FITC (M1/70), VEGFR2- phycoerythrin (PE) (Avas12 α1), lineage nega -tive cell detection kit (biotinylated protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type,  C (B220), CD3 antigen, ε polypeptide (CD3 ε), TER119, CD11b and Gr1), followed  by streptavidin-PE-CY7, c-Kit-allophycocyanin (APC) (2B8), Sca1-PE (D7), Gr1-PE (RB6-8C5), F4/80-APC (BM8), Tie2-PE (TEK4), CD29-APC (HMb1), CD105-PE (MJ7/18) and Met-FITC (eBioclone4). Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies were purchased from BD or eBioscience and used at predetermined saturating concentrations. Data acquired on a BD FACSCalibur cytometer with CellQuest software (BD) was analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar).
Flow cytometry for human samples.  Peripheral blood obtained from human subjects was centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min at 4 °C. Plasma was used for exo -some isolation and analysis. Peripheral blood cells were isolated using a Ficoll-Paque gradient (GE Healthcare). The buffy coat was separated, and the cells were washed in PBS and 1% BSA and collected by centrifugation at 400 g for 5 min at
Paque gradient (GE Healthcare). The buffy coat was separated, and the cells were washed in PBS and 1% BSA and collected by centrifugation at 400 g for 5 min at 4 °C. Residual red blood cells were lysed for 4 min at 4 °C using ACK lysis buffer (Gibco). Cells were incubated with flurochrome-conjugated antibodies diluted in PBS and 1% BSA, and washed in PBS and 1% BSA. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using antibodies to CD45-eFluor450 (2D1), C-KIT/CD117-PE (104D2), CD34-Alexa700 (581), TIE2-Alexa647 (CD202B) (33.1) and MET-FITC (eBioclone 97). Antibody-fluorochrome conjugates were purchased from BD Biosciences, eBioscience or BioLegend and used as suggested by the manufacturer. Data acquired on a BD FACSCanto was analyzed using FlowJo  (Tree Star) software.Cell lines and cell culture.  B16-F10, B16-F1, LLC, MCF-7, As-Pc1 and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in DMEM. SkBr3, SW480, SW620 and human melanoma cells (SK-Mel-) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with penicil -
lin (100 U ml−1) and streptomycin (100 µg ml−1) and 10% exosome-depleted FBS. The melan-a cells were maintained in RPMI  containing 10% FCS, 200 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; Sigma). Cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Human melanoma cell lines were obtained from MSKCC.Electron microscopy.  Exosomes purified as described above were fixed in 2% PFA (w/v) in 200 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Fixed exosomes were dropped onto a formvar-carbon–coated grid and left to dry at room temperature for  20 min. After washing in PBS, the exosomes were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde npg © 2016 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.
nature medicine doi:10.1038/nm.2753for 5 min, washed in water and stained with saturated aqueous uranyl oxalate for 5 min. Samples were then embedded in 0.4% (w/v) uranyl acetate and 1.8% (w/v) methylcellulose and incubated on ice for 10 min. The excess liquid  was then removed. The grid was dried at room temperature for 10 min and viewed at 20,000 and 50,000 magnification using an electron microscope (model 910, Carl Zeiss).Lung leakiness experiments.  Ten micrograms of total exosome protein were injected by tail vein. Conditioned media was prepared by filtering supernatant fractions of cultured B16-F10 cells through a 0.22- µm filter and ultracentifuging it at 100,000 g to deplete the exosomes. One hundred microliters of cultured media were injected by tail vein injection. As controls, mice were injected with 10 µg of melan-a exosomes, PBS or synthetic 100- µm unilamellar liposomes. Twenty
hours after exosome treatment, mice were injected with 2 mg of Texas Red lysine-fixable dextran 70,000 MW (Invitrogen) by retro-orbital injection. One hour after  dextran injection, mice were euthanized and perfused with 40 ml of PBS. Lungs were dissected and fixed in a mix of 2% PFA and 20% sucrose overnight.Immunofluorescence.  For immunofluorescence, 12 µm O.C.T. tissue sections were stained with antibodies to platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1  (CD31) (1:100) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) (1:100) (BD). For the vasculature analyses, each mouse was injected with 50 µ g Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated Isolectin GS-IB4 (Molecular Probes) 10 min before being euthanized. GFP+ and mCherry+ cells were detected by their intrinsic signals.
Fluorescent images were obtained using a Nikon confocal microscope (Eclipse TE2000U) and analyzed using Nikon software (EZ-C1 3.6). To determine the vessel density in the metastatic lesions, digital images of mCherry- or GFP-stained sections were analyzed with ImageJ Software (NIH) by determining the pixel intensity per square micrometer.Bone marrow progenitor cell enrichment, in vitro  treatment and responses to HGF. Mice were euthanized and their bone marrow was isolated by flushing the femur and tibia with PBS using a 25G 0.5-inch needle (BD). Cell suspen -sions were filtered through 70- µm cell strainers (BD) before centrifugation. To enrich for progenitors, lineage positive (Lin+, meaning, CD5+, CD45R+, CD19+, CD11b+, Ly6G/C+ and TER119+) bone marrow cells were immunomagnetically depleted using the EasySep Mouse Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Enrichment Kit (Stem Cell Technologies) following the manufacturer’s instructions. For
in vitro  bone marrow treatment with exosomes, bone marrow cells were flushed as described above and cultured in Stem Span (Stem Cell Technologies) for 16 h in the presence or absence of 20 µg ml−1 exosomes, as indicated. For the HGF analysis, bone marrow cells were then stimulated with 5 ng ml−1 HGF (Peprotech) for 4 h and collected for western blot analysis in radioimmunopre -cipitation assay buffer with phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM sodium orthovana -date and 5 mM β-glycerol phosphate). For MET signaling inhibition, cells were incubated with 20 nM crizotinib (Selleck Bio) 1 h before HGF stimulation.Quantitative real-time PCR and shRNA interference studies.  Total RNA was extracted from tissues or cells using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN) and was
reverse transcribed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Frozen tissues or cell lines were analyzed for specific gene expres -sion by quantitative real-time PCR using predesigned TaqMan assays (specific assay numbers: mouse Met,: Mm01156972_m1, mouse Cd44 : Mm01277163, human RAB27A : Hs00608302_m1, mouse Rab27a:  Mm00469997_m1, S100a8 : Mm00496696-g1, S100a9 : Mm00656925_m1) or GFP- or mCherry-specific
human RAB27A : Hs00608302_m1, mouse Rab27a:  Mm00469997_m1, S100a8 : Mm00496696-g1, S100a9 : Mm00656925_m1) or GFP- or mCherry-specific primers18 using SYBR Green PCR reagents (Applied Biosystems). The rela -tive expression was normalized to β-actin. For shRNA-mediated knockdown of Rab27a , lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs were purchased from Thermo Fisher. The human Rab27a  shRNA sense sequences used were V3LHS_300918: 5′-CCCAGTGTACTTTACCAATATA-3 ′ and V3LHS_300917: 5 ′-CAG  GGAAGACCAGTGTACTTTA-3 ′. The Rab27a  knockdown efficiency was similar  for both of the human shRNAs, however, V3LHS_300918 is shown in the figures. The sense sequence for mouse Rab27a  shRNA was V3LHS_300916 5 ′-ACAGG AGAGGTTTCGTAGCTTA-3 ′, and the scramble sense sequence used was 5′-ATCTCGCTTGGGCGAGAGTAAG-3 ′. The mouse Met shRNA sense sequences used were V3LMM_456078: 5 ′-CCAGACTTTTCATACAAGA  ATA-3′ and V2LMM_30812: 5 ′-CCCTATGTAGA-TCCTGTAATAA-3 ′. The
Met knockdown efficiency was similar for both shRNAs (routinely exceeding 90%, as determined by GFP expression), however, V3LMM_456078 is shown in the figures.Proteomic analysis.  Identification of exosomal proteins was performed using reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Samples were denatured at 90 °C, reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 51 °C for 1 h and alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide at 25 °C for 45 min. Proteins were digested with trypsin (Promega) overnight at 25 °C. Tryptic peptides were concentrated by vacuum centrifugation and desalted using C18 STAGE Tips before the mass spectrometric analysis. Samples were loaded by an Eksigent AS2 autosampler onto a 75- µm fused silica capillary column packed with 11 cm  of C18 reverse-phase resin (5- µm particles, 200-Å pore size; Magic C18, Michrom BioResources). Peptides were resolved on a 180-min 1–100% buffer B  gradient (buffer A, 0.1 mol l
gradient (buffer A, 0.1 mol l−1 acetic acid, buffer B, 70% acetonitrile in 0.1 mol l−1  acetic acid) at a flow rate of 200 nl min−1 (1200 series, Agilent). The high- pressure liquid chromatography instrument was coupled to a mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a resolution of 30,000 for full mass spectrometry followed by seven data-dependent tandem mass spectrom -etry analyses. Collision-induced dissociation was used for peptide fragmenta -tion. Each sample was analyzed at least two times. All mass spectrometry data
were analyzed with Proteome Discoverer software (version 1.2, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the SEQUEST algorithm to search against human and mouse UniProt databases. The peptides were constrained to be tryptic, and up to two missed cleavages were allowed. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine was specified as a variable modification. The precursor ion tolerance was set to 25 ppm, and the fragment ion mass tolerance was set to 0.8 Da. Search results were analyzed individually, and the data for the replicates were combined and evaluated. For the validation of the proteomic analysis, we performed a western blot analysis for the selected proteins (Met, CD44, annexin A2 and annexin A6; Fig. 4 a and data not shown) using equal amounts of exosomes derived from B16-F1 and B6-F10 cells.Microarray preparation and analysis.  For analyzing the genes modified in the
lung by B16-F10 exosomes, a total of 10 µg of exosome protein was injected by tail vein, and 24 h or 48 h later, mice were euthanized and their lungs were dissected and stored in RNA-later solution (Ambion) until RNA extraction.  A total of three mice were used per time point, and the experiment was performed in triplicate. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The Affymetrix One-Round In Vitro Transcription RNA Amplification Kit was used to amplify 1.5 µg of total RNA. The complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthe -
to amplify 1.5 µg of total RNA. The complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthe -sized with a primer containing oligo(dT) and T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequences. Double-stranded cDNA was then purified and used as a template to generate biotinylated cRNA. The quantity and quality of the amplified cRNA was assessed using a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and an Agilent Bioanalyzer. The biotinylated cRNA was fragmented and hybrid -ized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 Plus 2.0 GeneChip arrays containing 39,000 transcripts per array. After hybridization, the GeneChip arrays were washed, stained and scanned using a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G, according to the instructions of Affymetrix Expression Analysis. Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software was used for image acquisition. The target signal inten -
sity from each chip was scaled to 500. Triplicate samples from each exosome-treated sample and control lung sample were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes. For the statistical analyses, we selected genes whose expression differed between the treatment groups by a factor of at least two. A hierarchical clustering method was applied to group the genes and samples based on their similarities in gene expression, and the unsupervised analyses were visualized using the SOTA and TreeView software assuming Euclidean distances between the genes (http://bioinfo.cnio.es/cgi-bin/tools/clustering/sotarray). We tested the null hypothesis of equal means between the two groups using a t test and computed P values using a permutation test. The fold expression was calculated from the expression ratio in the exosome-treated conditions with respect to control samples.npg © 2016 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

Exosomes or cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitaiton assay buffer containing a complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 20 min. The supernatant fractions were used for western blot. Protein extracts
were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with the indicated antibodies. For the western blot or immunofluorescence analyses, we used antibodies to Hsp90 (1:1,000, Stressgen, ADI-SPA-830), Hsp70 (1:1,000, Stressgen, SPA-810-F), Hsc70 (1:500, Stressgen, ALX-804-067), the Rab-family sampler kit (Rab4, Rab5, Rab7, Rab9 and Rab11; 1:500, Cell Signaling, 9385), Rab27a (1:500, Abnova, H0005873-M02), TYRP2 (1:500, PEP-8h), VLA-4 (1:500, Chemicon, clone PS2), melan-a (1:1,000, Santa Cruz, 28871), programmed cell death 6 interacting protein (Alix) (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 2171), tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) (1:500, Santa Cruz, sc-7964), Met and pMet (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 3127 and 3077, respectively), pS6 kinase (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 9802) and pERK (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, 4370). Antibodies to GAPDH or β-actin (Santa Cruz, 1:1,000,
sc-25778 and 1:5,000, sc-130656, respectively) were used as loading controls. The intensities of the immunoreactive bands were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ software (NIH). For the analysis of protein expression profiles of the cells in conditioned media, we used the mouse angiogenesis antibody array (R&D) using 200 µg of cell extracts or 450 µl of media conditioned for 24 h. The MET and pMET analysis kits were purchased from MesoScale Discovery (MSD). All reagents were provided with the MSD kit, and the experiment was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using 10 µg of protein extract. MSD plates were read on the MSD Sector Imager 2400 plate reader. The raw data was measured as an electrochemiluminescence signal (light) detected by photodetectors and analyzed using the Discovery Workbench 3.0 software (MSD). The graphs depict mean photon intensity.Statistical analyses.  Error bars in the graphical data represent means ± s.e.m.
Mouse experiments were performed in duplicate using at least five mice per treatment group. All in vitro  experiments were performed at least in duplicate. P values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant by ANOV A. For the tumor growth analyses, we performed two-way ANOV A statistical analyses using GraphPad Prism software.npg © 2016 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

In the version of this article initially published, the upper and middle panels on the left-hand side in Figure 4a were interchanged, and the GAPDH loading panel in Supplementary Figure 6 was incorrect owing to an error in assembling the figures. The original western blot was rescanned to generate the correct GAPDH loading panel for Supplementary Figure 6. A new western blot was scanned to generate the bottom panel on the left-hand side in Figure 4a because the authors could not find the original western blot of the GAPDH loading panel.  The errors have been corrected in the HTML and PDF versions of the article.cOrriGendanpg © 2016 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.
