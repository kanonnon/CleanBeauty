Exosomes are extracellular microvesicles with a particle size of 30 –100 nm andcarry a cargo of proteins, lipids, RNA, and DNA. Their properties of shuttling in-and-out ofthe cells suggest that these particles can be exploited as a nano drug carrier. In thismanuscript, we show that curcumin can be delivered effectively using milk-derived exosomes.Curcumin when mixed with exosomes in the presence of 10% ethanol:acetonitrile (1:1)provided a drug load of 18 –24%, and the formulation stored at −80°C was stable for
6 months as determined by particle size analysis, drug load, and antiproliferative activity. Theuptake of exosomes by cancer cells involved caveolae/clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Oraladministration of exosomal curcumin (ExoCUR) in Sprague-Dawley rats demonstrated 3 –5times higher levels in various organs versus free agent. ExoCUR showed enhancedantiproliferative activity against multiple cancer cell lines including, breast, lung, and cervicalcancer compared with the free curcumin. ExoCUR showed signi ﬁcantly higher anti-inﬂammatory activity measured as NF- κB activation in human lung and breast cancer cells.To determine in vivo antitumor activity, nude mice bearing the cervical CaSki tumorxenograft were treated with ExoCUR by oral gavage, curcumin diet, exosomes alone, andPBS as controls. While curcumin viadietary route failed to elicit any effect, exosomes had amodest (25– 30%) tumor growth inhibition. However, ExoCUR showed signi ﬁcant inhibition
(61%; p< 0.01) of the cervical tumor xenograft. No gross or systemic toxicity was observed inthe rats administered with the exosomes or ExoCUR. These results suggest that exosomescan be developed as potential nano carriers for delivering curcumin which otherwise hasencountered signi ﬁcant tissue bioavailability issues in the past.KEY WORDS: Anti-cancer activity; Curcumin; Drug delivery; Exosomes; Toxicity.INTRODUCTIONCurcumin (CUR) is a well-studied chemopreventiveagent which exists as a native mixture of curcumin (75%),demethoxycurcumin (18 –20%), and bisdemethoxycurcumin(5–7%). Extensive preclinical studies over the past fourdecades suggest therapeutic activity against various diseasesincluding cancer ( 1). Our previous studies also indicatedCUR to attenuate hormonal breast cancer in rats whenadministered by subcutaneous polymeric implants ( 2). How-ever, the hydrophobic nature of CUR results in low watersolubility and rapid intestinal/hepatic metabolism limits its
oral bioavailability, impeding clinical development of CUR asa potential therapeutic agent ( 3).Several approaches and drug delivery systems have beenused to improve solubility and enhance oral bioavailability ofCUR. Liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, andother formulations have provided leads as drug deliveryvehicles; however, they are associated with inherent limita-tions, such as, short circulation time and stability issues whenused as unmodiﬁ ed liposomes in vivo (4,5). Micelles showinstability in aqueous or biological environment due to smallhydrophobic spaces and dissociates upon dilution. Further-more, a number of manufactured nanoparticles have recentlybeen shown to cause adverse effects (reviewed by ( 6–8)).Another approach to enhance the oral bioavailability of
CUR has been by inhibition of the metabolic conjugation ofCUR with glucuronic acid with the use of small moleculessuch as silibinin, piperine, and quercetin ( 9,10). Previously, weElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article

demonstrated that CUR delivered viapolymeric implantscould bypass the oral route and achieve higher blood andtissue levels ( 11,12), while protecting the drug from enzymaticand pH degradation. However, the use of polymeric implantsis restricted as it requires surgical grafting ( 13). Otherpolymeric delivery systems such as polymeric micelles ornanoparticles offer advantages of linking various ligands tothe surface, but its large-scale production is nowhere in thevicinity, besides toxicity concerns ( 14).Use of exosomes as nano drug delivery vehicles is anemerging area of research and has tremendous potential forthe development of novel therapeutic applications ( 15).Exosomes as a drug carrier have the potential to overcomelimitations associated with other nanoparticle-based technol-ogies ( 16,17). We have recently identiﬁ ed milk to contain highamount of exosomes. Milk exosomes possess all the proper-ties of an ideal drug delivery vehicle as bovine milk has been
in human use from the ancient time, is present in abundance,and can be loaded with both hydrophilic and lipophilic agents(18,19). Exosomes possess attributes such as longer circulat-ing half-life, faster internalization into cells, and ability to beattached with one or more tumor-recognizing ligand fortargetability making exosomes ideal nanovesicles for drugdelivery ( 18,19).In this study, we demonstrate that milk-derivedexosomes follow various active pathways for internalization.We show exosomal CUR (ExoCUR) formulation to be stableupon long-term storage, oral administration to achievesigniﬁcantly higher CUR tissue levels as compared to freeCUR. Furthermore, ExoCUR exhibited enhanced biologicalefﬁcacy measured as antiproliferative, anti-inﬂ ammatory, andantitumor activities. We also provide evidence indicating thatthe exosomal formulation is well tolerated without anyadverse effects.EXPERIMENTAL SECTIONReagents and Culture Materials
Reagents and Culture MaterialsCUR and the three curcuminoids were kindly providedby Sabinsa Corporation (East Windsor, NJ, USA). MTT andcell culture media were pur chased from Calbiochem(Gibbstown, NJ) and Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY). Allother chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained fromthe sources cited.Isolation of ExosomesExosomes were isolated from raw bovine milk collectedfrom a local dairy. Differential centrifugation was done at13,000× g, 100,000× g, and 135,000× gfor 30, 60, and 90 min,respectively, to isolate the exosomes as described previously(19). The exosome pellet was suspended in PBS and stored at−80°C. The size distribution was measured by Zetasizer(Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, Worcestershire, UK)and atomic force microscopy (AFM).Sucrose Density GradientBuoyant density of exosomes and the ExoCUR wasdetermined using 10 –60% ( w/v) sucrose density gradientmedium and centrifuged at 135,000× gin a swing bucket rotor
(SW 41Ti, Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA) at 4°C for8h .Quantification of Drug Loading and Entrapment EfficiencyCUR was loaded by mixing a solution of CUR inethanol:acetonitrile (1:1) with the exosomes at room temper-ature (22°C). The theoretical concentration of CUR to Exowaskept at 20%. The concentration of organic solvent waskept less than 10%. A low-speed centrifugation at 10,000× gfor 10 min was done to remove the unbound precipitatedCUR, and the concentration of unbound CUR was calculatedto determine the entrapment ef ﬁciency. The CUR-loadedexosomes were collected by ultracentrifugation at 135,000×gfor 90 min and washed with PBS three times. The ExoCURpellet was suspended in PBS and stored at −80°C until use.For drug load analysis, ExoCUR (50 μl) was mixed with950μl of acetonitrile and centrifuged at 10,000× gfor 10 min
to separate precipitated proteins. CUR was analyzed in thesupernatant by UPLC as described below. Protein pellet wasdissolved in water, and exosomal proteins were analyzed byBCA method. Loading capacity or percent drug load was

Loading capacity or percent drug load wascalculated using the following formula ( 18):Percent drug load¼amount of CUR in ExoCURamount of exosomal proteins in ExoCUR/C2100The percentage of drug entrapment ef ﬁciency wascalculated according to the following equation:%entrapment efficiency ¼drug added −untrapped drug ðÞdrug added/C2100Cells, Culture Conditions, and TreatmentsHuman lung cancer H1299 and A549 cells were providedby Drs. Paula Bates (University of Louisville, Louisville, KY)and C.G. Gairola (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY),respectively. Cervical cancer (HeLa) and breast cancer(MDA-MB-231 and T47D) cells were purchased from ATCC(Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in DMEM glutamaxmedium (A549 and H1299 cells), RPMI (HeLa, CaSki, andT47D cells), and L15 (MDA-MB-231 cells) containing 10%fetal bovine serum at 37°C in 5% CO2and humidi ﬁed air.Storage StabilityExo and ExoCUR formulations were prepared and
Exo and ExoCUR formulations were prepared andstored at −80°C prior to testing in cell culture and for animalexperiments. To ensure that formulations were stable, storagestability at −80°C was tested. ExoCUR was stored in PBS at−80°C and analyzed for CUR load after 3 and 6 months usingUPLC. Stability of the exosomal formulation was determinedby analyzing the drug load, size of the exosomes, andantiproliferative activity at different time intervals.1692 Aqil et al.
Atomic Force Microscopy AnalysisSize of the exosomes and ExoCUR was also determinedby AFM as described earlier ( 18). Details of method areprovided in Supplementary materials.Cellular Uptake of the ExosomesTo determine the cellular uptake, lung cancer H1299cells were plated in 8-well chamber slide and treated withdifferent endocytosis inhibitors for 2 h prior to incubationwith PKH-67-labeled exosomes (50 μg exosomal proteins/ml)for 4 h. Green ﬂuorescent cell linker (PKH-67) was used tolabel the milk exosomes as per manufacturer ’s instructions.The inhibitors of caveolae (colchicine and genistein), clathrin(sucrose and phenothiazine), microtubule (actin) (cytochala-sin D), Golgi bodies (brefeldin A), and microtubule/macropinocytosis (nocodazole) were used ( 20). Actin andnuclei were stained with Alexa Fluor 555 Phalloidin andDAPI, respectively. To determine the metabolic inhibition,cells were treated with the metabolic inhibitor, sodium azide
or incubated at 4°C in the presence of PKH-67-labeledexosomes. After incubation with PKH-67-labeled exosomesfor 8 h, H1299 cells were ﬁxed and incubated with endocy-tosis markers caveolin-1, clathrin, early endosome markersEEA1, late endosome Rab 7, and recycling endosome Rab11(Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) primary antibody for 1 hfollowed by anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 546 (Thermo FisherScienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA). CellLight® lysosomes-red ﬂuores-cent protein (RFP) reagent was used to label lysosomes (red).Nuclei were visualized by staining with DAPI. Images weretaken at ×20– ×40 magni ﬁcation on a confocal microscope.Tissue Drug Analysis and Toxicity TestingFemale (5– 6-week-old) Sprague-Dawley rats ( n=4 )were procured from Envigo (Indianapolis, IN) and acclima-tized for 1 week. Following acclimation, rats were treateddaily with either free CUR (2.5 mg/kg b. wt.) or ExoCUR(1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg b. wt.) by oral gavage for 14 days.Animals were euthanized by CO
Animals were euthanized by CO2asphyxiation; blood anddifferent tissues were collected and stored at −80°C untilanalysis.Liver, lung, and brain tissues (~ 500 mg) were homog-enized and extracted with 2 vol of ethyl acetate in thepresence of 0.5 M sodium acetate as described previously(11). The extracted CUR was analyzed by UPLC usingconditions described below.For toxicity testing, blood and serum samples were usedto analyze hematological and biochemical parameters asdescribed ( 18).Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography AnalysisDrug load and stability of ExoCUR were determined byUPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) as described previously(12). Details of experimental conditions are provided insupplementary materials.Cell Proliferation AssayAntiproliferative activity was determined against lung,cervical, and breast cancer cells as described previously(21,22). Cells were plated at an initial density of 3 × 103(lung
3(lungcancer) and 5 × 103(cervical and breast cancer) cells per welland treated with CUR or ExoCUR (0.25 –50μM) and incubatedfor 72 h. Exosome concentration was maintained constant at50μg/ml. Inhibition of cell proliferation was analyzed by MTTassay as described ( 19).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssayDNA binding of NF- κB was measured in the vehicle-,CUR-, and ExoCUR-treated lung and breast cancer cell byEMSA as described ( 23). Experimental conditions areprovided in the supplementary materials.In Vivo Tumor Xenograft StudiesAthymic nude mice (female; 5 –6-week-old) were pur-chased from Envigo (Indianapolis, IN). Animals were main-tained under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle in accordance withthe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)guidelines. All the animal experiments conducted in fullcompliance with local, nationa l, ethical, and regulatoryprinciples and local licensing regulations, per the spirit of
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of LaboratoryAnimal Care (AAALAC) expectations for animal care and
principles and local licensing regulations, per the spirit ofAssociation for Assessment and Accreditation of LaboratoryAnimal Care (AAALAC) expectations for animal care anduse/ethics. Antitumor activity was determined against cervicalcancer CaSki cells. A suspension of 5 × 106CaSki cells mixedwith Matrigel (100 μl; 1:1) was injected subcutaneously. Whenthe tumor xenografts grew to 50 –60 mm3, the mice wererandomized and treated on alternate days by oral gavage witheither vehicle (PBS), Exo (80 mg/kg b. wt.), or ExoCUR(CUR —20 mg/kg b. wt. and Exo— 80 mg/kg b. wt.). Anadditional group of animals was provided diet supplementedwith CUR (400 ppm) that is equivalent to 60 mg/kg b. wt.based on average 3-g diet consumption. Tumor dimensions(length, width, and height) of the tumors were measured withdigital calipers. The animals were euthanized after 7 –8 weeksof the treatment by CO2asphyxiation.Statistical AnalysisAll statistical analyses were performed using Student ’sttest
or one-way analysis of variance with GraphPad Prism statisticalsoftware (version 4.03; La Jolla, CA). In all the analyses, a pvalue of less than 0.05 was considered signi ﬁcant.RESULTSExosome Isolation and CharacterizationExosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation frombovine milk and characterized for structure morphology,buoyant density, particle size, and presence of exosomalmarkers. The average size of isolated exosomes as determinedby Zetasizer was 84 ± 7 nm and had polydispersity index (PDI)of 0.19 ± 0.02 (Fig. 1A). The size and morphology of exosomeswere con ﬁrmed by AFM (Fig. 1B), in fact, the size revealed by1693 Exosomes for Tissue Bioavailability and Efficacy of Curcumin
AFM was somewhat smaller (60 –80 nm) that could be due toshrinkage during drying.Drug Loading, Entrapment Efficiency, and StabilityCUR (Fig. 1C) loaded onto the exosomes in the presenceof ethanol and acetonitrile (1:1; 10%) provided a drug load of18–24%. Unbound CUR was removed by low-speed centri-fugation, and ExoCUR was harvested by ultracentrifugation.The entrapment ef ﬁciency of exosomes for CUR was foundto be 53.9 ± 6.7%. Size analysis of ExoCUR revealed thatthere was slight but insigni ﬁcant increase in the size(93 ± 6 nm) after CUR loading with a PDI of 0.21 ± 0.04(Fig. 1A).Buoyant density of exosomes and ExoCUR determined bysucrose-density gradient (10 –60%) indicated that ExoCURretained the density of 1.18 g/cm3similar to that of unloadedexosomes (Fig. 2a). The isolated particles were con ﬁrmed to be
exosomes by the presence of exosomal surface markers CD63,CD81, Tsg101, and Alix by Western blot analysis (Supplemen-tary Fig S 1). UPLC chromatogram of curcuminoids extractedfrom the exosomal formulations revealed similar ratio ofcurcuminoids as present in the parent material suggesting allthe curcuminoids were loaded proportionately (Fig. 2b). Thestability of CUR in exosomal formulation upon long-termstorage was determined by solvent extraction and UPLCanalysis. There was essentially no change in the CUR levelsafter 6 months of storage at −80°C. Exosomal formulation ofCUR showed almost unaltered particle size (104 ± 11 nm) after6 months of storage. The antiproliferative ef ﬁcacy of theExoCUR against A549 lung cancer cells after storing for6 months remained similar to the ef ﬁcacy determined with thefresh formulation (Fig. 2c).Cellular Uptake and TraffickingIn order to explore the cellular uptake mechanism ofmilk exosomes, the H1299 cells were pretreated with various
endocytosis inhibitors or incubated at 4°C prior treatmentwith PKH-67-labeled exosomes. Incubation of cells at 4°Cprevented uptake of exosomes compared to incubation underphysiological condition (37°C) (Supplementary Fig 2S) andpretreatment of cells with 0.1% sodium azide caused nearly50% decrease in uptake, suggesting that cellular uptake ofexosomes to be an energy-dependent process (Fig. 3a). Thecaveolae inhibitor, colchicine, and clathrin inhibitor, pheno-thiazine, resulted in 53 and 48% decrease in uptake ofexosomes, respectively; microtubule inhibitor, nocodazole,and actin inhibitor, cytochalasin D, caused 32 and 21%inhibition of exosome internalization by cells, respectively(Fig. 3a). Involvement of calveolin-1 and clathrin proteinswas con ﬁrmed by observation of co-localization with PKH-67-labeled exosomes in lung cancer cells (Fig. 3b).To understand the subcellular traf ﬁcking of exosomes, we
examined the co-localization of PKH-67-labeled exosomes withearly endosome EEA1, late endosome Rab7, and recyclingendosomal (Rab11) markers. After 1- to 8-h incubation, PKH-67-labeled exosomes were found to co-localize mainly withEEA1. However, after longer incubation of 24 h, exosomesshowed decreased co-localization with early endosomal markersand increase association with late endosomal marker Rab7 andRab11 (Fig. 3c) indicating that the exosomes move from earlyendosome into late endosome with time. Further, labeling of celllysosomes with RFP indicated co-localization of exosomes withlysosomes (Fig. 3d). These data indicated that the majormechanisms of cellular internalization of exosomes were anenergy-dependent process involving caveolae- and clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathways. We further show thatexosomes undergoing endocytosis were targeted to lysosomes.Exosomal Formulation Increases Tissue Bioavailability ofCUR
CURWe evaluated the tissue distribution of CUR in the lung,liver, and brain. In all tissues examined, signi ﬁcantly higher(p< 0.05) levels of CUR were found with ExoCUR versusfree CUR at equivalent doses (2.5 mg/kg b. wt.) (Fig. 4).
liver, and brain. In all tissues examined, signi ﬁcantly higher(p< 0.05) levels of CUR were found with ExoCUR versusfree CUR at equivalent doses (2.5 mg/kg b. wt.) (Fig. 4).Liver and brain tissues showed higher levels of CUR even athalf the dose of ExoCUR as compared to those of free CUR(Fig. 4). The maximum enhancement (6-fold) was found inthe brain, suggesting that exosomes could facilitate higherbioaccumulation of CUR in the brain. The three curcumi-noids in CUR were detected in similar ratios in the tissues,irrespective of whether the animals were treated with freeCUR or ExoCUR.Anti-In ﬂammatory Activity of ExoCURCUR is a well-established anti-in ﬂammatory agent ( 24).ExoCUR inhibited both constitutive and TNF α-induced NF- κBlevels in lung and breast cancer cells (Fig. 5A and B), while freeCUR was essentially ineffective. Similar effects were observedagainst LPS-induced NF- κB activation (Fig. 5C).A modest anti-in ﬂammatory effect of the exosomes alone
was also evident against the constitutive (Fig. 5B1/B2) andTNFα-induced NF- κB( F i g . 5C1/C2) levels. These protectiveeffects are presumably exerted by the endogenous cargo ofimmune factors, miRNAs, and proteins in the exosomes ( 25,26).Enhanced Antiproliferative and Antitumor Effects ofExoCURAntiproliferative activity of E xoCUR was determined againstseveral human cancer cell lines. Compared with free CUR, weobserved an increased antiproliferative ef ﬁcacy of ExoCUR (Fig.6) with all cancer types examined. The growth inhibition increasedfrom 23 to 66% against H1299 lung cancer cells and from 34 to61% against A549 lung cancer cells with free CUR and ExoCURat 1.56 μM concentration each. ExoCUR showed even greaterinhibition of cell growth against cervical and breast cancercells—70–80% compared to 10 –35% with CUR. Milk exosomesper se exhibited signi ﬁcant growth inhibitory effects ranging from15–45%, different cancer cell types (Fig. 6).
15–45%, different cancer cell types (Fig. 6).The ef ﬁcacy of ExoCUR in vivo was tested using humancervical cancer (CaSki) xenografts. Animals were treatedwith vehicle, exosomes, or ExoCUR at (20 mg/kg b. wt.) byoral gavage three times a week. An additional group receivedfree CUR in diet at 400 ppm (equivalent to 80 mg/kg b. wt.).Dietary CUR showed no effect on the growth of tumorxenograft. However, a signi ﬁcantly higher inhibition of tumorgrowth was observed with ExoCUR (61%; p< 0.01) com-pared to that of Exo alone (21%) (Fig. 7).1694 Aqil et al.
Toxicity StudyTo test systemic toxicity, wild-type SD rats were treatedwith vehicle, exosomes alone, CUR, and ExoCUR. In thisstudy, we selected rats over mice so that suf ﬁcient blood couldbe obtained to determine CUR levels and assess toxicityparameters. Neither CUR nor ExoCUR showed any signs ofany gross toxicity based on the body weight gain and dietintake, etc. Based on blood analysis, CUR and ExoCUR didnot alter hematological and liver/kidney function parameters.We observed slight but insigni ﬁcant increase in cholesterollevels with ExoCUR (Fig. 8).Fig. 1. Particle size determination of milk-derived exosomes and ExoCUR by Zetasizer and atomic force microscopy(AFM).

DISCUSSIONCUR is one of the most investigated plant bioactives forbene ﬁts against various diseases; however, medicinal bene ﬁtsof this compound are limited because of its low oralbioavailability ( 27,28). In spite of the extensive research,poor aqueous solubility of CUR remains a major barrier in itsbioavailability and clinical ef ﬁcacy ( 27). Several attemptshave been made to address pharmacokinetics, safety, andefﬁcacy of CUR in clinical trials ( 29). Efforts taken toincrease its solubility and bioavailability include encapsula-tion of CUR in liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, biode-gradable microspheres, phospholipid mixtures, and hydrogels(1,29–37). However, none of these delivery systems hasadvanced to translational setting due to inherent toxicity,high costs, and/or non-scalability ( 38). In the current report,we demonstrate that milk-derived exosomes can overcomethe bioavailability issues of CUR.Exosomal formulation of CUR quali ﬁes as ideal
Exosomal formulation of CUR quali ﬁes as idealnanoformulation due to physical attributes such as averagesize of about 100 nm with a PDI of 0.19 ± 0.02. Suf ﬁcientlyhigh drug load (~ 20 –25%) could be achieved by simplemixing of CUR in presence of solvents concentration 10%which preserves the quality attributes of the exosomes. Ourformulation of ExoCUR was free of unbound CUR. Theunbound CUR separates from the ExoCUR by twomechanisms: (i) The low-speed centrifugation removes theunbound CUR as a precipitate, and (ii) The unbound CURpresent in the soluble form is removed by collecting theCUR-loaded exosomes by ultracentrifugation. Loading ofCUR on to exosomes presumably occurs due to theinteractions between highly lipophilic CUR andFig. 5.

hydrophobic domains on the surface exosomal proteins,however, we cannot rule out if part of the loading is “into”the exosome lumen and lipid membrane. This aspectremains to be investigated. ExoCUR formulation stored at−80°C was stable for 6 months with unaltered drug loadand particle size. Moreover, the storage of ExoCUR had noeffects on its antiproliferative potency.Internalization of exosomes by cells has been proposed bytwo major mechanisms, endocytosis and fusion ( 39–41). Inagreement with earlier reports our ﬁndings with milk exosomesrevealed that the key mechanism of cellular internalization of theexosomes was an energy-dependent process involving caveolae-and clathrin-dependent endocy tosis pathways; however, minorcontribution from other pathways is also a possibility. Theinternalized milk exosomes were fu rther sequentially transportedthrough early endosomes, late e ndosomes, and lysosomes. Theseresults also corrobora te with previous stud ies examining dynam-
ics of exosome internalization and traf ﬁcking where exosomeswere reported to be endocytosed and targeted to lysosomes ( 42).It is also possible that some milk exosomes could be released intothe cytoplasm by endosomal escape but this would need to beelucidated.Cellular uptake, stability, and bioavailability are theimportant factors that determine tissue levels of the drug.Our published data have recently shown the oral stability ofexosomes and exosomal drug formulations (19 ). We have alsoshown that drug-loaded exosomes could handle the harshconditions of enzymatic digestions using simulated gastroin-testinal ﬂuids ( 43). In agreement with our ﬁndings, Vashishtand colleagues recently demonstrated that CUR encapsulatedin milk exosomes not only resists human digestion but alsopossesses enhanced intestinal permeability ( 44). In anotherstudy, human milk exosomes and their microRNAs wereshown to survive stimulated ga stric/pancreatic digestion
in vitro and were taken up by human intestinal cells ( 45).There is some evidence that mesenchymal stem cell-derivedexosomes ( 46) and edible plant-derived exosome-like nano-particles ( 47) exhibit similar resistance to enzymatic digestion.Fig. 6. Growth inhibition of human cancer cells by curcumin (CUR) and ExoCUR. Lung cancercells A549 (i) and H1299 (ii) were treated with CUR (1.56 μM), 3.12 μg/ml Exo alone, or ExoCUR(1.56 μM and 3.12 μg/ml Exo proteins) for 72 h. Cervical cancer cells Caski (iii) and HeLa (iv), andbreast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 (v) and T47D (vi) were treated with either 12.5 μM CUR or45μg/ml Exo alone or ExoCUR (12.5 μM CUR and 45 μg/ml Exo proteins).

Higher levels of CUR observed in the liver after oraladministration of ExoCUR fo rmulation indicate rapiduptake and sustainability, while increased accumulation inthe brain could be attributed to prolonged circulation timeand protection of CUR from degradation in the exosomalformulation compared with free CUR at equivalent doses(48,49). Interestingly, nearly 6-fold higher bioaccumulationof CUR in the brain will be of signi ﬁcant importance inprotection against neurodegenerative disorders ( 50). Highertissue availability has bee nc o r r e l a t e dw i t hi n c r e a s e dcellular uptake observed in case of different cell lines ( 48).It has been previously shown that CUR delivered viagrapefruit-derived nanovectors provided higher levels ofC U Ri nt h ec o l o nc o m p a r e dt of r e eC U R( 49). Althoughthere is no report to compare the tissue levels of CURdelivered in exosomal formulation, there are few studies onthe plasma CUR analysis showing higher oral bioavailability
of CUR used in nanoformulations. The silica-coated ﬂexibleliposomes enhance the bioavailability of CUR ( 51). Simi-larly, the PEG-PLA nanoparticle of CUR has been shownto produce signi ﬁcantly higher CUR concentration inplasma and six times higher AUC and mean residence timein mice brain than regular CUR ( 52). These studies and ourdata suggest that nanoformulations of CUR includingExoCUR enhance its bioavailability in animals.Inﬂammation plays a major role in various diseasesincluding cancers ( 53). Anti-in ﬂammatory activity of CUR iswell established, hence it was interesting to examine the effectof ExoCUR on the nuclear transcription factor NF- κBactivity, an established inﬂ ammation marker. Both constitu-tive and induced NF-kB levels were remarkably inhibited byExoCUR in cancer cell lines in comparison with those of freeCUR. Sun et al. (2010) reported similar enhanced anti-inﬂammatory activity of CUR with exosomal formulationover liposomal CUR and free CUR ( 53,54).
over liposomal CUR and free CUR ( 53,54).Since CUR is not stable when given orally in free form,we used diet supplemented wi th CUR to better compare withthe exosome formulation. Also, CUR, being a highly lipo-philic molecule, has almost no solubility in PBS/normalsaline. Moreover, several studies in Sprague-Dawley ratshave shown only negligible amount of CUR in the plasmafollowing high doses of CUR (1000 –2000 mg/kg) given orallyas reviewed ( 55). ExoCUR demonstrated greater antiprolif-erative activity and signi ﬁcant ( p<0 . 0 1 )t u m o rg r o w t hinhibition in comparison with dietary CUR. These ﬁndingscorroborate with our published studies where similarFig. 8. Toxicity testing of milk-derived exosomes (Exo) and curcumin (CUR)-loaded exosomes (ExoCUR). Wild-type rats were treated withPBS, CUR (2.5 mg/kg b. wt.), or two doses ExoCUR (1.25 and 2.5 mg CUR/kg b. wt., each containing 25 mg Exo proteins/kg b. wt.) daily by
oral gavage. After 14 days, animals were euthanized by CO 2asphyxiation. Blood was collected at the time of euthanasia, and hematologicaland various biochemical parameters were analyzed. Data represent average ± SD of four animals. No differences were observed whenstatistical analysis was done using Student ’sttest1699 Exosomes for Tissue Bioavailability and Efficacy of Curcumin
enhanced anti-cancer effects were observed with exosomalformulations of withaferin A ( 18) and celastrol ( 18,54,56)i ncomparison with respective free agents. The higher ef ﬁcacycould be assigned to e nhanced stability, uptake and/or higheravailability of CUR (57 ). On the other hand, dietary CURfailed to show any protective effects likely due to poorintestinal absorption ( 56) and is consistent with our earlierreport where CUR alone failed to provide protection againsthormone-induced breast cancer tumorigenesis ( 2,13,18,57).Consistent with our previous report ( 18), exosomes in theabsence of any drug resulted in moderate intrinsic antiprolif-erativeactivity,anti-in ﬂammatoryeffects in vitro ,andmodestin vivo tumor growth inhibition. These bene ﬁcial effectscould be partially contributed by immune factors, miRNAs,and proteins which are the ex osomes carry as a payload(25,26). Modest tumor inhibition exhibited may also related
to some endogenous factors, e.g., complex of oleic acid withhuman milk-derived α-lactalbumin (HAMLET) or bovinemilk-derived α-lactalbumin (BAMLE T) has been reportedto trigger tumor cell death ( 58–61). Therefore, the enhancedactivity of CUR in exosomal formulation could, in part, beattributed to the vehicle itse lf which is an additional bene ﬁt.Although both the exosomes and CUR are derived fromnatural sources, it is essential to determine the effect onbiochemical and hematological parameters following oraladministration. Examination of different tissues (liver, lung,kidney, and brain) did not show any signs of gross toxicity dueto the interventions as compared to vehicle treatment. Wehave also reported that exosomes provide bene ﬁcial effectand do not exert any gross or systemic toxicity.CONCLUSIONExosomal formulation of CUR was prepared with thegoal of improving its tissue bioavailability. This nanoformu-lation overcomes limitations of low oral bioavailability of
CUR and reduces its effective dose. Exosomal formulationresulted in increased tissue accumulation of CUR presumablydue to higher uptake, prolonged circulation, and protectionfrom rapid hepatic degradation. ExoCUR demonstratedenhanced antiproliferative, anti-in ﬂammatory, and antitumoractivities compared to free CUR. Furthermore, the milk-derived exosomes and ExoCUR showed lack of any cross-species reaction. Thus, exosomes may offer an effectivenanodelivery method for CUR and other plant bioactives,many of which otherwise face oral bioavailability issues.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe are thankful to Dr. Manicka V.
