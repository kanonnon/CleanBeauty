Close vegetation proximity might result incompetition for resources, such as light. To face this challenge, plants have evolved twoalternative strategies: to either tolerate or avoid shade. Shade-avoiding species generallyadapt their development by inducing hypocotyl, stem, and petiole elongation, apicaldominance and ﬂowering, and decreasing leaf expansion and yield, a set of responsescollectively known as the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). The SAS responses have
been mostly studied at the seedling stage, centered on the increase of hypocotylelongation. After compiling the main ﬁndings about SAS responses in seedlings, thisreview is focused on the response to shade at adult stages of development, such aspetioles of adult leaves, and the little information available on the SAS responses inreproductive tissues. We discuss these responses based on the knowledge about themolecular mechanisms and components with a role in regulating the SAS responseof the hypocotyls of Arabidopsis thaliana . The transcriptional networks involved in thisprocess, as well as the communication among the tissues that perceive the shade andthe ones that respond to this stimulus will also be brieﬂy commented.Keywords: shade avoidance syndrome, Arabidopsis thaliana , hypocotyl, petiole, elongation, adult tissues,reproductive tissuesINTRODUCTIONOver the past few decades, improvements in crop yields have come largely through increasing
planting densities. Under the current scenario of rapid population growth and limited amount ofarable land on Earth (http://www.fao.org/news/st ory/en/item/35571/icode/), eﬃcient agriculturalpractices might require evenhigher planting densities together with changesin plant architectureAbbreviations: ATHB, ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA HOMEOBOX; BBX, B-BOX CONTAINING proteins; BEE, BRENHANCED EXPRESSION; bHLH, basic-helix-loop-helix; BIM, BES1-INTERACTING MYC-LIKE; EOD-FR, end of day-far red; FR, far-red light; HAT, HOMEOBOX FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA ; HD-Zip II, homedomain leucine zipperclassII;HFR1,LONGHYPOCOTYLINFAR-RED1;IAA,indole-3-aceticacid; IAAgene, IAA INDUCIBLE gene;IP A,indole-2-piruvic acid; NPA, 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid; PAR, photosynthetic active radiation; PARgenes, PHYTOCHROMERAPIDLY REGULATED genes; PHY, PHYTOCHROME; PIF, PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR; PIFQ, PIF

Roig-Villanova and Martínez-García Arabidopsis Adult Responses to Shadeas a way to maximize crop yield. The optimum plant densityof each plant species is determined by its peculiar set ofrequirements and the environmental factors that directlyinﬂuence plant growth and, consequently, crop yield. However,ingeneral,asplantingdensitiesincreasesodoestheshadesignalsprovided by plants and, hence, the activation of plant responsesto vegetation proximity. For many plant species, perception ofplant proximity results in a set of responses known as the SASthat strongly aﬀects plant development and architecture. Whenactivated, SAS results in a reduced seed set and altered fruitdevelopment. Crops are typically grown at high densities, andSAS responses, if activated, are generally detrimental to yieldbecause they induce reallocation of resources into elongationgrowth at the expense of harvestable organs (usually leaves,fruits, and seeds). Therefore, one key research challenge that
will certainly have a major impact in agriculture is to identifythe mechanisms that underlie plant development in response tovegetationproximity.The aim of this review is to describe what is known aboutthe response to shade in adult tissues, such as petioles of adultleaves, and the little information available on the SAS responsesin reproductive tissues. We focus on studies performed inArabidopsis thaliana in response to signaling by red (R, about600–700 nm) and FR (about 700–800 nm), as the inﬂuenceof PAR (between 400 and 700 nm) and other environmentalfactors, such as green and blue light, ethylene production ormechanical stimuli have been reviewed recently ( Pierik and deWit, 2014 ). We discuss the responses occurring in adult tissuesbased on the knowledge available on the molecular mechanismsandcomponentswitharoleinregulatingtheSASresponseofthehypocotylsandtheirparticipationinthetranscriptionalnetworksthatmediatethisprocess.VEGETATION PROXIMITY SIGNALS AND
VEGETATION PROXIMITY SIGNALS ANDPLANT PERCEPTIONIn both natural and agricultural plant communities, lightmight become a limiting resource under high plant density.In such a situation, plants have evolved to either tolerateor avoid shade. Shade tolerance is achieved by diﬀerent setsof responses in diﬀerent species, such as alterations in leafphysiology, biochemistry, anatomy and morphology, and/orplant architecture. In general, under low light intensities, shadetolerant species tendtoadapt toa highly conservative utilizationof resources, commonly accompanied by low growth rates,thinner leaves, reduced apical dominance (increased branching)andlowelongationresponse( Martinez-Garciaetal.,2010 ;Casal,2012;Gommers et al., 2013 ). By contrast, shade-avoiding (orsun-loving) species generally tend to adapt their developmentto favor elongation at the expense of leaf development, andto increase apical dominance (reduced branching), allowing
young and growing tissues to escape from shade. These SASresponses can be viewed as the optimum strategies to adapt toeventualshadinginnaturalenvironments.Bycontrast,activationof SAS is generally detrimental for crop yield in agronomicalterms.How Vegetation Announces Itself: theR:FR SignalIn open conditions, i.e., when a plant grows under lowvegetation density, the light coming from the sun (or sunlight)is relatively constant in quality, and the R:FR is about 1.2–1.5. In environments of high vegetation density, two relatedbut diﬀerent situations that lower the R:FR can occur: plantproximity (without direct shading by neighboring plants) anddirect plant canopy shade . Because vegetation is considered topreferentially reﬂect FR compared to other wavelengths, plantproximity generates an intermediate or moderate reduction inthe R:FR. By contrast, under a plant canopy, photosyntheticpigments from green tissues speciﬁcally absorb light from the
PAR region (between 400 and 700 nm) whereas FR, which is
the R:FR. By contrast, under a plant canopy, photosyntheticpigments from green tissues speciﬁcally absorb light from thePAR region (between 400 and 700 nm) whereas FR, which ispoorly absorbed byplant tissues,is reﬂectedfrom or transmittedthrough vegetation. Consequen tly, under direct plant canopyshadeboththeamountofPARandR:FRisstronglyreduced(lowand very low R:FR), the latter eﬀect mostly due to the selectivedepletion of the R of the sunlight ﬁltered by the leaves ( Smith,1982;Martinez-Garciaetal.,2010 ;Casal,2013 ).How Plants Perceive Nearby Vegetation:The Role of PhytochromesThe R:FR changes indicative of plant proximity or shadeare detected by the phytochrome photoreceptors, which inA. thaliana are encoded by a small gene family of ﬁvemembers ( PHYAtoPHYE). Whereas PHYAencodes the onlyphotolabile phytochrome, phyA, the other PHYgenes encodephotostable phytochromes, phyB–phyE. Phytochromes exist intwophotoconvertibleforms,aninactiveR-absorbingPrformand
an active FR-absorbing Pfr form. Consequently, in the light, thesteady-state ratio of Prand Pfr f orms (that can also be describedas the relative levels of active Pfr form, Pfr/Ptot) depends on theR:FR.Indeed,thereisapositivecorrelationbetweentheR:FRandthePfr/Ptotlevels.UnderhighR:FR(i.e.,lowvegetationdensity)thephotoequilibrium isdisplacedtowardtheactivePfrform,thePfr/Ptot is high (0.7 or higher), and the SAS is suppressed. Onthe contrary, under low R:FR the p hotoequilibrium is displacedtowardtheinactivePrform,thePfr/Ptotislow(0.6orlower),andtheSASisinduced( Smith,1982,2000 ;Casal,2012,2013 ;Possartetal.,2014 ).Genetic analyses in Arabidopsis have shown that mutantsdeﬁcient in phyB display long hypocotyls and early ﬂoweringwhen growing under high R:FR (in open conditions or underlow density of vegetation). These are phenotypes very similar tothose of wild-type plants growing under low R:FR ( Figure 1).Therefore,theconstitutiveSASphenotypeof phyBmutantplants
was taken as indicative that phyB is repressing SAS responsesunder high R:FR conditions, i.e., that responses to low R:FRare primarily mediated by phyB. Mutant analyses also showedthat phyD and phyE act redundantly with phyB in controllingadult SAS responses, such as petiole elongation and internodeelongation between rosette leaves (reviewed in Martinez-Garciaetal.,2010 ;Casal,2012 ).Genetic analyses have also indicated that phyAmutantseedlings display enhanced (rather than reduced) responses toFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 2 February 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 236

Cartoonssummarize the results presented by different authors mentioned in this review. n.a., data not available; WT, wild type.lowR:FR,whichindicates thatphyA andphyB haveantagonisticactionsinshade.Thisisparticularlyobviouswhengrowingunderdeep plant shade. Whereas vegetation proximity (that resultsin moderate R:FR) promotes a similar hypocotyl elongationin wild-type and phyAseedlings, under deep and direct plantcanopy shade (that results in low and very low R:FR) hypocotylsof wild-type seedlings tend to elongate signiﬁcantly less thanthose of phyAmutant seedlings, which display an exaggerated
elongation ( Figure 1;Johnson et al., 1994 ;Yanovsky et al., 1995 ;Martinez-Garcia et al., 2014 ;Possart et al., 2014 ). Therefore,phyB is deactivated by shade of intermediate, low and verylow R:FR, resulting in a promotion of hypocotyl elongation. Bycontrast, phyA is strongly activated mostly by shade of low andvery low R:FR, conditions that prevent the excessive elongationof the seedling caused by the deactivation of phyB, henceensuring an optimum hypocotyl elongation under deep shade.Therefore, phyA and phyB actions help to distinguish betweenplant proximity and direct plant canopy shade ( Martinez-Garciaetal.,2014 ).Mimicking Plant Proximity and Shade inthe Laboratory with Light Treatments:Low R:FR and End-of-Day-FR (EOD-FR)TreatmentsLaboratory conditions that mimic plant proximity, before actualcanopy shading occurs, have been termed simulated shade ,a n dthosethatmimicnaturaldirectplantshade,whencanopyclosure
occurs, canopy shade (Roig-Villanova et al., 2007 ;Possart et al.,2014).Severalauthors,however,employtheterm simulated shadeassynonymousofintermediate,loworverylowR:FRtreatments,i.e., independently on the amount of FR employed. To avoidambiguitiesandtocomparethediﬀerentconditions,inthispaperwe will employ the terms (1) simulated shade, to refer to anyconditions that lower the R:FR and have not been deﬁned bythe authors as mimicking vegetation proximity or shade; (2)proximity shade, to those conditions that simulate plant orvegetation proximity; and (3) canopy shade, to those conditionsthat mimic natural direct plant shade. These treatments areobtained in the laboratory by applying increasing intensities ofFR to a ﬁxed intensity of white light (W), usually provided byﬂuorescent tubes: for a given amount of PAR, intermediateR:FR(about 0.50–0.30)results inproxim ity shadetreatments,andlowand very low R:FR ( <0.29) results in canopy shade treatments
(Martinez-Garciaetal.,2014 ).TheseR:FRvalues,however,mightdiﬀer between laboratories depending on the window (in nm) ofthe R and FR measured. A better way to distinguish or comparetheseshadeconditions, asalreadydiscussedbefore,isgeneticallybyanalyzingthediﬀerentialhypocotylelongationofthe phyAandphyBmutantseedlings( Figure 1).One might think that the very low R:FR of the canopy shadetreatments rarely exists in nature: because the amount of FRemployed in the laboratory to supplement the W is very high,it seems diﬃcult to comprehend how nature can produce suchas high proportion of FR simply by ﬁltering and transmittingdiﬀerentially the R and FR components of the sunlight. In thatrespect it is important to keep in mind that in chlorophyll-richorgans,suchasleaves,lightabsorption fromtheultraviolettotheR part of the visible region by chlorophyll leads to the emissionof FR by ﬂuorescence ( Thornber, 1975 ), a property that might
contribute to create low and very low R:FR signals in naturaldense canopies. Indeed, there are reports for canopies in which
of FR by ﬂuorescence ( Thornber, 1975 ), a property that mightcontribute to create low and very low R:FR signals in naturaldense canopies. Indeed, there are reports for canopies in whichR:FR of less than 0.10 have been measured (reviewed in Smith,1982).In addition to supplementing W with FR, an alternative wayto induce SAS responses is to treat plants with a pulse of FR fora few minutes at the end of the light period and immediatelybefore starting the dark phase of the photoperiod. These arecalled end-of-day-FR (E OD-FR) treatments ( Smith, 1982 ).

Roig-Villanova and Martínez-García Arabidopsis Adult Responses to Shadeof the phytochromes during the subsequent dark period. Thesetreatmentsarelessrepresentativeofthenaturalneighborsignals,although they are considered to induce those shade responsesdependent on the photostable phytochromes ( Johnson et al.,1994),i.e.,thosepromotedbyvegetationproximity.SHADE AVOIDANCE RESPONSES INSEEDLINGSThe Response of Seedlings to PlantProximity and Shade: Looking forSimplicity Inside ComplexityPlants at seedling stage have been shown to respond to shadeat the level of hypocotyls/epicotyls, cotyledons and primaryleaves. While the cotyledon (petiole and area) response tosimulated shade has been poorly studied, hypocotyl elongationhas been most commonly and deeply studied. Analyses ofthe hypocotyl elongation responses to simulated shade inArabidopsis led to conclude that the SAS induction is regulatedat least in part by the interaction of active phytochromes
with the PIFs ( Leivar and Quail, 2011 ;Jeong and Choi,2013), which results in rapid changes in the expression ofdozens of PHYTOCHROME RA PIDLY R EGULATED (PAR)genes, postulated to be instrumental for the implementationof the SAS responses. Because many of these PARgenesencode transcriptional regulators, it is considered that SASresponses are consequence of the phytochrome regulationof a transcriptional network, composed by several types oftranscriptional regulators organized in partially redundantfunctional modules. Genetic analyses performed measuring thehypocotyl elongation demonstrated roles in the SAS regulationforseveral PARgenes.ThisisthecaseofmembersoftheHD-ZipII,(e.g.,ATHB2,ATHB4,HAT1,HAT2,andHAT3),bHLH(e.g.,BEE1,BIM1,HFR1,PAR1,andPIL1)andB -BOXCONTAINING(BBX) families of proteins. Analyses of mutants with alteredlevels of these factors led to propose negative (HFR1, PAR1,PIL1, BBX21, and BBX22), positive (BEEs, BIMs, BBX24, and
BBX25) and complex (HD-Zip II) roles in the SAS regulation(Salter et al., 2003 ;Sessa et al., 2005 ;Roig-Villanova et al., 2006,2007;Hornitschek et al., 2009 ;Sorin et al., 2009 ;Crocco et al.,2010;Cifuentes-Esquivel et al., 2013 ;Gangappa et al., 2013 ).Further analyses have also involved non-PAR factors in theregulation of SAS hypocotyl response such as HD-Zip class IIIandgrowth repressingDELLAproteins( Djakovic-Petrovic etal.,2007;Brandt et al., 2012 ). PIF1, PIF3, PIF4, PIF5 (called thePIFQ),andPIF7,proteinsofthebHLHfamilyknowntopromotegrowth, were also identiﬁed as positive players of the hypocotylSAS response ( Leivar et al., 2012 ;Li et al., 2012 ). In contrastwith PARgenes, the expression of these PIFgenes is unaﬀectedby simulated shade, but the phosphorylation of PIF proteins ispromoted by the active form of phytochromes, which reducesPIFQstabilityandPIF7DNA-bindingactivity.Consequently,thereduction in the levels of active phytochromes under low R:FR
increases the stability of PIFQ and the DNA-binding activity ofPIF7toitstargetgenes,whichresultsintheup-regulationof PARexpression( Lorrainetal.,2008 ;Lietal.,2012 ).Itseems,therefore,that simulated shade perception rapidly changes the balance ofpositive and negative factors that eventually cause hypocotyls toelongate.Simulated shade treatments were shown to rapidly andtransientlyincreaseendogenouslevelsof auxins( Taoetal.,2008 ;Hornitscheketal.,2012 ;Lietal.,2012 ;Bou-Torrent etal.,2014 ).SAV3encodes TAA1, an enzyme required for the shade-inducedbiosynthesis of IAA, a bioactive auxin ( Tao et al., 2008 ).YUCgenes encode ﬂavin monooxygenase-like proteins that catalyzea rate-limiting step in IAA biosynthesis. Indeed, TAA and YUCfamiliesfunctioninthesameauxinbiosyntheticpathway,knownas the indole-2-pyruvic acid (IPA) pathway ( Figure 2), whichproducesIAAthatisessentialforplantdevelopment( Mashiguchiet al., 2011 ;Zhao, 2014 ). PIF4, PIF5, and PIF7 were shown to
directly regulate the shade-induced expression of some YUC
producesIAAthatisessentialforplantdevelopment( Mashiguchiet al., 2011 ;Zhao, 2014 ). PIF4, PIF5, and PIF7 were shown todirectly regulate the shade-induced expression of some YUCgenes; in addition, the shade-mediated increase of auxin wasmuch reduced both in pif4pif5andpif7mutant seedlings. TheseFIGURE 2 | Scheme to explain how phytochrome action may regulateauxins (biosynthesis, transport, and sensitivity) in the response ofseedlings and leaves of adult plants to plant proximity. Shadeperception integrates with auxins at multiple levels, affecting both auxinbiosynthesis and sensitivity. It is unknown whether shade perception alsoaffects auxin transport. The two steps in auxin biosynthesis (enclosed in blackdotted squares and represented by thick empty arrows) are indicated togetherwith the involved enzymes (SAV3/TAA1 and YUC). Auxin transport is indicatedin gray and auxin sensitivity in purple. Black and purple lines indicate that the

Roig-Villanova and Martínez-García Arabidopsis Adult Responses to Shaderesults led to propose that PIF4, PIF5, and PIF7 might directlycontrol auxin biosynthesis. PIFs also directly regulate auxinresponsivegenes,suchas INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE29(IAA29), indicating as well a possible involvement of PIFs inmodulating auxin sensitivity ( Hornitschek et al., 2012 ;Li et al.,2012). Genetic analyses indicate that BIM transcription factorsmight also play a direct or indirect role in auxin synthesis viathe control of YUCexpression ( Cifuentes-Esquivel et al., 2013 ).In addition, several PAR factors, such as ATBH4, PAR1, BIM,and BEE proteins, provide entry points by which shade- andauxin-regulated networks are integrated ( Sorin et al., 2009 ;Bou-Torrent et al., 2014 ). In summary, there is abundant evidencefor the involvement of several factors in controlling auxin levelsand sensitivity in the hypocotyl elongation response. However,
how auxin and other hormones are integrated in controllingshade-inducedhypocotyl elongationiscurrently unclear.The Physical Separation Between theSites of Shade-Perception andResponse: Inter-Organ CommunicationThere is an additional spatial level of regulation of seedlingresponses to SAS. The physical separation between the sites ofshade perception and response is highlighted by a miscellanyof experimental approaches in diﬀerent species that employedlocalized shade irradiation (EO D-FR or low R:FR) of cotyledons(orprimary leaves,aswewillsee later)combinedwithmolecularor physiological analysesin the responding stems (hypocotyls orepicotyls;reviewedby Bou-Torrentetal.,2008 ).Thus, detailed analyses in Brassica rapa seedlingssuggested that shade perception in the cotyledons, the siteof photoperception of this signal in the seedlings, triggers localsynthesis of IAA that is then transported to the hypocotyl. Inthere, auxin induces the up-regulation of auxin-related genes
associated with the SAS hypocotyl response. Together, theresults show that cotyledon-generated auxin regulates hypocotylelongation ( Procko et al., 2014 ). Organ-speciﬁc transcriptomicanalysesusing micro-samples prepared fromthetopmost partofthehypocotyls(referredtoasshootapexsamples)andcotyledonsfrom Arabidopsis youngseedlingsdiﬀerentiallyirradiatedwithorwithoutEOD-FRindicatedthattheresponsetoshadeintermsofchanges in gene expression in the shoot apex is more prominentthan in the cotyledons, likely reﬂecting the higher diversity ofcell types in the shoot apex samples. The ﬁnding of speciﬁcand shared EOD-FR-induced genes in both types of samplessuggests the existence of tissue speciﬁc and common regulatorycomponents involved in the implementation of the SASresponses in the diﬀerent tissues. In addition, localized EOD-FRspotlight irradiation also indicated that EOD-FR induced geneexpression depends on both organ-autonomous (i.e., HFR1and
ATHB2) and interorgan mechanisms, which involve the role ofauxins and PIFs. Indeed, cotyledons are the major site of shadeperceptionthatcontrolsseveralapex-responsivegenes,includingthose that are auxin-responsive and/or PIF7-dependent. This isconsistentwiththeknownroleofPIF7predominantlyregulatingthe seedlings SAS response by controlling auxin biosynthesis incotyledons ( Figure 2). However, the shade signal perceived inthe shoot apex also controls gene expression in the cotyledons(i.e., YUC2), providing evidence for an unexpected bidirectionalcommunication between these seedlings parts ( Nito et al.,2015).

cotyledons in Arabidopsis and inhibits cotyledon expansioninB. rapa(Roig-Villanova et al., 2007 ;Procko et al., 2014 ).
ADULT PLANTSIn seedlings, low R:FR promotes elongation of the petiole ofcotyledons in Arabidopsis and inhibits cotyledon expansioninB. rapa(Roig-Villanova et al., 2007 ;Procko et al., 2014 ).In plants that present a non-rosette habit of growth, suchas cowpea, tobacco, or mustard, internode elongation is alsostrongly promoted in response to a variety of shade-mimickingtreatments ( Casal and Smith, 1988 ;Martinez-Garcia et al., 2000 ;Pierik et al., 2004 ). In an even more complex way than inseedlings, Arabidopsis showsabroad rangeof responsesto shadein the adult tissues such as promotion of petiole elongation inthe rosette leaves (usually together with an inhibition of leafbladeexpansion),promotionofﬂoweringandinﬂorescencestemlength together with a suppression of axillary bud outgrowth(Finlayson et al., 2010 ;Gonzalez-Grandio et al., 2013 ). In thissection, only leaf responses will be covered, including the eﬀects
on leaf polarity. We will also discuss the role of shade on thereproductivedevelopment.Petiole Elongation, Leaf Expansion, andLeaf CurlingThe Arabidopsis leaf consists of a blade(or lamina)and a petiole(Figure 3A ).Thepetiole placestheleafbladeintheposition thatis best suited for light reception. Hence,the regulation of petioleelongation seemsimportant to maximizephotosynthesis. OneofthemoststudiedSASresponseoftherosetteleavesof Arabidopsisis petiole elongation, which is promoted by light treatmentsthat simulate vegetation proximity or canopy shade, such as lowR:FR and EOD-FR ( Kozuka et al., 2005 ;Sasidharan et al., 2010 ;Figures 1 and 3A). Genetic analyses indicate that leaf petioleelongation is regulated by photostable phytochromes: the phyBmutanthaslongerpetiolesthanthewildtype( Figure 1),andthephyAphyBphyD andphyAphyBphyE mutantshavelongerpetiolesthan the phyAphyB double mutant ( Reed et al., 1993 ;Devlinetal.,1998 ).Therefore,thepromotion ofpetiolegrowthbyshade
signalsismediatedmainlybyphyBwiththecontributionofphyDandphyE( Casal,2012 ).Growth and elongation of plant organs require the normallyrigid cell wall to weaken and thus allow continued expansion.XTHs are well-characterized cell wall modifying proteins thathave been involved in cellular expansion ( Rose et al., 2002 ).Indeed, petiole elongation is associated with an increase inXTH activity, which acts enzymatically (hydrolysis and/ortransglucosylation) on the ce llulose and hemicelluloses(xyloglucan in most eudicots) network and results in thenecessary cell wall loosening.

The two antagonisticeﬀects of shade on leaf growth are very likely concomitantand connected ( Figure 3A ). This suggests that when leaves areexposed to proximity or canopy shade, growth is invested inFIGURE 3 | Adult leaves present a dual response to plant proximity and

(A) Cartoon representing the two parts that form an Arabidopsis adultleaf and their differential growth response to EOD-FR or simulated shadetreatments: growth promotion of the petiole length and growth inhibition of theblades. (B)A Venn diagram illustrating differences in the expression of genesinduced by EOD-FR in blades and in petioles allows identifying a core set ofgenes that are induced in both tissues. Data are extracted from availablemicroarray data ( Sasidharan and Pierik, 2010 ).petiole elongation at the expense of blade expansion. The EOD-FRtreatmentpromotesmorestrongly theelongationofthebasalpart of the petiole, although both the basal and apical part ofthis organ elongate. Similarly, the EOD-FR inhibited mostly theexpansion of the middle portion of the leaf blades ( Figure 3A ).At the leaf stage analyzed, both eﬀects happened by diﬀerentialcontrol of cell elongation, with a negligible contribution of cell
division ( Kozuka et al., 2005 ). Other authors showed that thereduced blade area of the ﬁrst leaf fully grown under canopyshade and reduced light intensities is caused by decreased cellproliferation rather than cell size ( Carabelli et al., 2007 ). Theseopposed observations might account for the diﬀerent shadetreatments and age of the leaves on which shade was appliedby diﬀerent laboratories, and suggest that exposure to proximityor canopy shade might aﬀect primarily cell division at earlystages of leaf development and ma inly cell expansion in alreadyformedleaves.Mutant phyBplantsdisplayelongatedpetiolesandsmaller leaf blades compared to wild-type plants, a phenotypethat indicates a role for phyB in the regulation of these traits inopposite manners ( Figure 1;Robson et al., 1993 ;Kozuka et al.,2005).Itseems,therefore, thatthe shadesimilarly aﬀects the patternof growth of photosynthetic organs (i.e., it inhibits leaf blade
and cotyledon expansion) and of supportive organs (i.e., itpromotes leaf petiole and hypocotyl elongation). It is unknownwhether the regulators of shade-induced hypocotyl elongationalso control the shade-induced petiole elongation. Availabletranscriptomic data suggest the existence of some commonregulators ( Kozuka et al., 2010 ). Microarray analyses revealedthat many auxin- and brassinosteroid (BR)-responsive genesshowedalteredexpressioninresponsetoEOD-FRinboththeleafbladeand the petiole. Indeed,52 and 81 auxin-responsive genes,including the IAA,GH3and SMALL AUXIN UPREGULATEDRNA(SAUR) families, were up-regulated by EOD-FR in the leafblade(from a total of 109 genes) and petiole (from a total of 168genes), respectively. Genes that are dually controlled by auxinandBRwereoverrepresentedintheEOD-FR-inducedgenesalsoin leaf blades and petioles ( Kozuka et al., 2010 ). Similarly, rapidchanges in the expression of several auxin- and BR-responsive
geneswere observedinsimulatedshadeexposedseedlings( Bou-Torrent et al., 2014 ). Amongst the genes induced by the EOD-
changes in the expression of several auxin- and BR-responsivegeneswere observedinsimulatedshadeexposedseedlings( Bou-Torrent et al., 2014 ). Amongst the genes induced by the EOD-FR treatments in petioles and/or blades, several were foundto encode transcriptional regulators known to be instrumentalfor the SAS seedling response, such as ATHB2,HAT2,HAT3,HFR1,PAR1,BEE1,a n d BIM1(Figure 3; Supplementary TableS1). Some of these genes are directly regulated by PIFs (e.g.,ATHB2,HFR1,andPAR1),suggestingthatthesefactorsalsohavearegulatoryroleintheshade-inducedleafgrowthandexpansion.Although there is not yet experimental evidence conﬁrming thispossibility, single or multiple PIF-deﬁcient mutants, such aspif4and the double pif4pif5show small and compact rosettes;in agreement, PIF4and PIF5overexpressing plants displayexpanded rosettes with strongly elongated petiole leaves undera range of light conditions or temperatures ( Pierik et al., 2004 ;
Lorrain et al., 2008 ;Sasidharan et al., 2010 ). Recent advancesindicated that PIF7 has a predominant role in regulating petioleelongation and leaf blade expansion in response to low R:FR,Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 6 February 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 236
Roig-Villanova and Martínez-García Arabidopsis Adult Responses to Shadewhereas PIF4, PIF5, and HFR1 have a minor or no role inthese leaf responses. In addition, auxin levels are induced inthe leaf blade shortly after exposure to low R:FR, a burst thatis absent in pif7mutant (de Wit et al., 2015 ). These ﬁndingssupports the existence of both shared (PIF7) and unique (PIF4,PIF5, HFR1) regulatory components and/or mechanisms of theSAS in diﬀerent stages of development, e.g., hypocotyl and leafgrowth.Perception of shade in rosette plants such as Arabidopsis ,which have leaves close to the ground, usually results in arepositioningoftheleaves,whichhelpstoavoidshadingimposedbyneighboring plants. Theupwardbendingof theleaves,causedby faster growth on their lower than their upper side, is calledhyponasty. The hyponastic response to low R:FR is severelyreducedinarangeofauxinmutants,suchas sav3,whichencodesan enzyme involved in the rapid increase of endogenous levels
of IAA required for the shade-induced hypocotyl elongation(Figure 2), and pin3, which encodes a protein that controls thedirection and rateof cellular auxin eﬄux, indicating that the leafhyponastic response to simulate d shade requires an intact auxinsignaling( Casal,2012 ).Proximity or canopy shade seems also to aﬀect an additionalaspect of leaf blade development: curling or ﬂattening. Theregulation of leaf ﬂatness is considered to contribute to theeﬃcient absorption of light under low light, conditions thataccompany the canopy shade. When analyzing wild-type andphyBplants grown under continuous W, it was observedthat in the wild type, the fourth leaves were gently curleddownward whereas in phyB, leaves were ﬂat. In transgenic linesoverexpressing PHYBthe leaves were more severely curled thanin the wild type, suggesting that phyB inhibits ﬂattening of theleaves (Kozuka et al., 2013 ). In addition, in the wild type, leaf
ﬂattening was promoted by EOD-FR treatments, which rapidlyeliminated the active Pfr phytochrome. Whereas phyBexhibitedvery ﬂat leaves without EOD-FR and failed to respond to EOD-FR, the already curled-leaf phenotype in PHYBoverexpressingplants was substantially suppressed by EOD-FR. Taken together,it was concluded that the active Pfr form of phyB promotes leafcurling, a process that might involve the regulation of auxinresponsivenessinthisorgan( Kozuka etal.,2013 ).Leaf curling is most probably caused by an uneven expansionofepidermalcellsonthe adaxial(upper) and abaxial(lower) leafsides, although no information is available about the eﬀect ofshade on the epidermal cell area on these sides of the leaves. Itis intriguing to ﬁnd that mutants with altered levels of ATHB4and/or HAT3, two paralog genes encoding transcription factorsof the HD-Zip class II and identiﬁed as regulators of the SAShypocotyl elongation response ( Sorin et al., 2009 ), do show
a role in controlling the dorso-ventral patterning of leaves.Whereas double athb4 hat3 mutant plants result in severelyabaxialized leaves,overexpression of HAT3results in adaxializedleaf development, which is v isualized by a strong upward-curling of leaf blades, a phenotype caused by overproliferationof abaxial-derived tissues in leaves ( Bou-Torrent et al., 2012 ).Sincelong-termexposuretoshaderesultsinleaveswithﬂattenedblades, these results suggest that ATHB4and HAT3,s h o w nto be functionally redundant (Sorin et al., 2009 ), might bepart of the mechanisms regulating this SAS response in adultleaves.In summary, at the rosette stage, shade light signals promoteupward positioning of leaves and petiole elongation; usually,they also reduce lamina expansion and enhance ﬂattening ofthe leaves ( Figure 1 ). The combination of these responsesplaces leaf lamina away from th e shade of neighbors, likelyenhancing the photosynthetic activity of the plant. Current
evidence supports that some regulators of these responses
places leaf lamina away from th e shade of neighbors, likelyenhancing the photosynthetic activity of the plant. Currentevidence supports that some regulators of these responsescould be shared with those in seedlings, despite the structuraldiﬀerences between the involved organs. Very recently it hasbeen also suggested that Arabidopsis plants reorient their leavesupon recognition of kin neighbors ( Crepy and Casal, 2015 ),although there is some controversy on whether this is morea case of phenotype matching ( Crepy and Casal, 2016 ;Till-Bottraud and de Villemereuil, 2016 ). The beneﬁcial eﬀectsof these rearrangements on plant ﬁtness by alleviating thestrong competition for light open an interesting subject ofstudy.Spotlight EOD-FR irradiation applied separately to the leafblade and petiole indicated that the photoperceptive site for theregulation of petiole elongation was the leaf blade but not thepetioleitself.Acandidatemoleculeforthemobilesignalis,again,

Analyses of expression of GH3.3(At2g23170 )a n d IAA6(At1g52830 ),twoauxin-responsive genesinthepetioleidentiﬁedpreviously as also being induced after EOD-FR treatment of thewhole plant, showed that their expression was under the controlof phytochrome in the leaf blade; i.e., the spotlight given on theleaf blade eﬀectively induced gene expression not only in theleaf blade but also in the petiole. In contrast, petiole irradiationwas not eﬀective at all in inducing the expression of these twogenes in the petiole itself. Together, these simple and elegantexperiments indicated that phytochrome action in the leaf bladecontrols gene expression and elongation responses in the petiole(Kozuka et al., 2010 ). Auxin transport from the blade to thepetiole seems to play a role in this elongation response sincethe auxin transport inhibitor NPA speciﬁcally suppresses petioleelongation in response to EOD-FR or to low R:FR ( Pierik et al.,
2009;Kozukaetal.,2010 ),evenwhentheNPAwaslocallyappliedjust in the petiole-blade junction ( de Wit et al., 2015 ). Morerecently, it was shown that low R:FR treatments rapidly increaseIAA levels in the leaf blade, a process dependent on PIF7 ( deWitetal.,2015 ),aresultsuggestingthatlowR:FR-inducedauxinproduction takes place mainly in the leaf lamina and would bethen transported to the petiole, a blade-petiole communicationthat might be analogous to the one of the cotyledon-hypocotyl(Hornitscheketal.,2012 ;Lietal.,2012 ;Bou-Torrentetal.,2014 ).However, the similar kinetics of auxin levels in the blade andpetioles of low R:FR-treated plants does not completely ﬁt withthismodel,suggestingthatotheraspects,suchaschangesinauxinsensitivity,mayalsohavearoleinthisSASresponse.SAS Responses During PlantReproduction: A Sophie’s Choice?Arabidopsis plants grown under photoperiodic conditions inwhich thelight phasehasalow R:FR display amarkedreduction

Roig-Villanova and Martínez-García Arabidopsis Adult Responses to Shadein ﬂowering time. As this response has been recently coveredin great detail ( Casal, 2012 ), it will not be discussed in here.Accelerated ﬂowering of Arabidopsis plants has been associatedwith reduced seed set, truncated fruit development, and oftena severe reduction of the germinability of the seeds produced(Smith and Whitelam, 1997 ), although a highly signiﬁcantgenetic variation for the germination response was found(Dechaine et al., 2009 ). However, there is very little informationinArabidopsis or related species about these SAS responses.Recently, it was described that B. rapaadult plants grown undersimulated shade showed notice ably longer siliques, producedfewer mature seeds per silique, and those seeds were smaller(Procko et al., 2014 ).Arabidopsis plants grown under the sameconditionshadsigniﬁcantly reducedseedyieldperplant( Procko
et al., 2014 ). In W conditions, phyB-deﬁcient mutant plants ofB. rapa(named as ein194) displayed reduced seed number persilique compared with wild-type plants, suggesting that someof these phenotypes are in part determined by phyB signaling.PhyB activity did not appear to play a signiﬁcant role in thedetermination of other phenotypes examined, such as siliquelength and seed weight ( Procko et al., 2014 ). In Arabidopsis ,the endogenous factors that determine ovule/seed number arestarting to be elucidated [reviewed by ( Cucinotta et al., 2014 )].However, due to the poor characterization of shade responsesinArabidopsis adult reproductive stages, there is virtuallyno information about its regulation by this environmentalsignal.Transcript levels of a few PARgenes, such as PHYB,HFR1,PIL1,ATHB4,and HAT3,were signiﬁcantly increased under lowR:FR conditions in inﬂorescences, indicating that reproductivetissues perceive and respond (at least molecularly) to plant
proximity or shade ( Reymond et al., 2012 ). In seedlings, theexpression of PIL1and HFR1is directly regulated by the actionof some PIFs in response to simulated shade( Hornitschek et al.,2012). Hence, it will be interesting to address whether PIFs alsohave a role in the regulation of the mentioned SAS responses inreproductivetissues.In general, SAS responses are considered to redirectphotoassimilates toward elongation at the expense of storageorgans. In reproductive stages, in which no major elongationevents are involved, exposure to plant proximity or canopyshade makes plants to face a diﬀerent dilemma: whether toinvest in producing lots of seeds, many of which might notbe viable because of the insuﬃciency of photoassimilates, orin a limited amount of viable seeds. In this Sophie’s choice,plants seem to favor the latter str ategy. Finding the regulatorycomponents and mechanisms involved might help to developnovel ways to improve crops for the coming and challenging
times.FINAL REMARKSAlong this review we have highlighted the idea that in order toadjust plant growth to shade conditions, responses might varydepending on the organ, the stage of development and/or thespecies considered. These studies have been centered mainly inArabidopsis andrelateddicots.Inmonocots,mostoftheanalyzedresponses to shade refer to changes in plant architecture, whichstronglyreduceyield.Indeed,likein Arabidopsis andotherdicots,a robust SAS responses in grasses could divert resources tostem elongation at the cost of grain production (reviewed byWarnasooriyaandBrutnell,2014 ).Despite the eﬀorts made by many laboratories during thelast decades to understand the SAS (reviewed in Martinez-Garcia et al., 2010 ;Casal, 2012 ;Pierik and de Wit, 2014 ),there is still little information about these responses in adultplants. There is, for instance, a special lack of knowledgeabout the photoperceptive site of shade in SAS responses
in reproductive tissues. In relation to the shade-promotion
plants. There is, for instance, a special lack of knowledgeabout the photoperceptive site of shade in SAS responsesin reproductive tissues. In relation to the shade-promotionof ﬂowering in Arabidopsis , it seems likely that the site ofshade perception (leaves) is separated from the site of action(shoot apical meristem), as it is known to happen in thephotoperiodic-dependent ﬂowering induction. However, thereis no information about this aspect in the SAS responses ofthe reproductive tissues, although, as mentioned, inﬂorescencetissues perceive and respond molecularly to plant proximity(Reymond et al., 2012 ). Considering that in Arabidopsiswhen inﬂorescences are fully growing, rosette leaves arealready senescing, it seems likely that – for these responses- the site of perception and action coincide. Thus, futureresearch on the characterization of the SAS responses inadult plant stages, as well as on its spatial and genetic
regulation, will greatly contribute to the understanding ofthis important adaptive trait with critical impact on cropyield.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSIR-VandJFM-Gwrotethemanuscript.FUNDINGIR-V holds a Beatriu de Pinós contract from the Agència deGestió D’Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR,GeneralitatdeCatalunya).OurresearchissupportedbygrantsfromtheSpanishMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad (BIO2014-59895-P)andAGAUR(2014-SGR447 andXarba)toJFM-G.ACKNOWLEDGMENTWe are very thankful to Briardo Llorente for critical commentson the manuscript, and to lab members (Maria José Molina andSandiPauliši ´c)fortheircommentsandsuggestions.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALThe Supplementary Material for this article can be found onlineat:http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpls.2016.00236Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 8 February 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 236
