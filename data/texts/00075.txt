Skin aging is characterized by features such as wrinkling, loss of  elasticity, laxity, and rough-textured appearance. This aging process is accompanied with phenotypic changes in cutaneous cells as well as structural and functional
changes in extracellular matrix components such as collagens and elastin. With intrinsic aging, structural changes occur in the skin as a natural consequence of  the biological changes over time and produce a certain number of  histological, physiological, and biochemical modifications. Intrinsic aging is determined genetically (influence of  gender and ethnic group), variable in function of  skin site, and also influenced by hormonal changes. Visually it is characterized by fine wrinkles. By comparison, “photoaging” is the term used to describe the changes occurring in the skin, resulting from repetitive exposure to sunlight. The histological, physiological, and biochemical changes in the different layers of  the skin are much more drastic. From a mechanical point of  view, human skin appears as a layered composite containing the stiff  thin cover layer presented by the
stratum corneum, below which are the more compliant layers of  viable epidermis and dermis and further below the much more compliant adjacent layer of  subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Upon exposure to a strain, such a multi-layer system demonstrates structural instabilities in its stiffer layers, which in its simplest form is the wrinkling. These instabilities appear hierarchically when the mechanical strain in the skin exceeds some critical values. Their appearance is mainly dependent on the mismatch in mechanical properties between adjacent skin layers or between the skin and subcutaneous white adipose tis -sue, on the adhesive strength and thickness ratios between the layers, on their bending and tensile stiffness as well as on the value of  the stress existing in single layers. Gradual reduction of  elastic fibers in aging significantly reduces the skin’s ability
to bend, prompting an up to 4-fold reduction of  its stability against wrinkling, thereby explaining the role of  these fibers in skin aging. Anti-aging medicine is practiced by physicians, scientists, and researchers dedicated to the belief  that the process of  physical aging in humans can be slowed, stopped, or even reversed through existing medical and scientific interventions.
of  physical aging in humans can be slowed, stopped, or even reversed through existing medical and scientific interventions. This specialty of  medicine is based on the very early detection and prevention of  age-related diseases. Physicians practicing anti-aging medicine seek to enhance the quality of  life as well as its length, limiting the period of  illness and disability toward the end of  one’s life. Anti-aging medicine encompasses lifestyle changes (diet and exercise); hormone replacement therapies, as needed, determined by a physician through blood testing (DHEA, melatonin, thyroid, human growth hormone, estrogen, testosterone); antioxidants and vitamin supplements; and testing protocols that can measure not only hormone levels and blood chemistry but every metabolic factor right down to the cellular level.Keywords:  Skin Care; Anti-Aging; Photoaging; Wrinkles; Antioxidants; Keratinocytes; Retinoids.

Besides protecting the body from water loss and micro -organism infection, it has an important cosmetic role. Young and beautiful appearance may have a positive influence on people’s social behavior and reproductive status. Cleopatra, the Egyptian queen is said to have indulged in daily donkey-milk baths, a prac -tice which apparently required over 700 donkeys to accomplish.The alpha hydroxy acids in the milk is believed to be anti-aging and skin-softening agents. Tang-dynasty ruler and sole female em -peror of  China, Wu Zetian, maintained a lifelong interest in skin -
care formulas. She mixed her “fairy powder” (made of  carefully harvested and prepared Chinese motherwort) with cold water in order to wash her face each morning. The empress was a famed beauty well into her old age.The most hair-raising entrant in this list, 16th century Hungarian countess Elizabeth Báthory is infa -mous for being one of  the world’s first documented female serial killers. Most of  her life is shrouded in mystery and legend-the most famous story being that she would regularly bathe in the blood of  her female victims. Mary, Queen of  Scots, the ill-fated and attractive adversary of  Elizabeth I, spent her sixteenth-centu -ry happier days on her estate in Edinburgh, Scotland, where her beauty regimen was said to include white-wine baths. In addition to wine’s antiseptic alcohol content, it was also was thought to improve complexion in general. Crème Céleste, a favorite product of  empress Elisabeth (Sisi) of  Austria, was a concoction of  sper -
maceti (a wax found in the head of  sperm whales), sweet almond oil, and rosewater. She would apply this daily and at night, she was known to coat her face in raw veal and crushed strawberries, kept in place with a custom-made leather mask. The skin folds are indicative of  an aged personality, but not youthfulness. So, every -one wants to look younger for whole of  the life, which lead to the discovery of  many surgical and non-surgical treatment modalities to improve the youthfulness. Since the introduction of  Botox in 2002 after FDA approval more aesthetic procedures using Botox were performed by aestheticisms involving plastic surgeons and dermatologists. However, many scientists are now starting to view physical aging as a disease process. The cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in aging reveal an intricate series of  signals, markers, and pathways, all of  which are programmed to moni -tor and control the lifespan of  a cell as it ages. By studying these
molecular events and pathways, the field of  anti-aging will be fur -thered by the use of  more and more cosmetics.IntroductionSkin aging is a complex biological process influenced by a combi -nation of  endogenous or intrinsic and exogenous or extrinsic fac -tors. Because of  the fact that skin health and beauty is considered one of  the principal factors representing overall “well-being” and the perception of  “health” in humans, several anti-aging strat -egies have been developed during the last years. In contrast to thin and atrophic, finely wrinkled and dry intrinsically aged skin, premature photoaged skin typically shows a thickened epidermis, mottled discoloration, deep wrinkles, laxity, dullness and rough -ness. Gradual loss of  skin elasticity leads to the phenomenon of  sagging. Slowing of  the epidermal turnover rate and cell cycle lengthening coincides with a slower wound healing and less ef -fective desquamation in older adults. This fact is important when
sagging. Slowing of  the epidermal turnover rate and cell cycle lengthening coincides with a slower wound healing and less ef -fective desquamation in older adults. This fact is important when esthetic procedures are scheduled. On the other side, many of  these features are targets to product application or procedures to accelerate the cell cycle, in the belief  that a faster turnover rate will yield improvement in skin appearance and will speed wound healing. A marked loss of  fibrillin-positive structures as well as a reduced content of  collagen type VII (Col-7), may contribute to wrinkles by weakening the bond between dermis and epidermis of  extrinsically age skin. Sun-exposed aged skin is characterized by the solar elastosis. The sparse distribution and decrease in col-lagen content in photoaged skin can be due to increased colla -gen degradation by various matrix metalloproteinases, serine, and other proteases irrespective of  the same collagen production. The
overall collagen content per unit area of  the skin surface is known to decline approximately 1%/year. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are among the primary dermal skin matrix constituents assisting in binding water. In photo-aged skin, GAGs may be associated with abnormal elastotic material and thus be unable to function effectively. The total hyaluronic acid (HA) level in the dermis of  skin that age intrinsically remains stable; however, epidermal HA diminishes markedly. Decreased estrogen levels may play a role in skin aging in women and compounds stimulating estrogen recep-tors could potentially counteract some of  the visible signs of  ag -ing. As people live longer, women spend a larger portion of  their lives in a post-menopausal state, with a deficiency of  estrogen as compared to their younger selves. Changes in diet and increas -ing exercise, together with a regimen of  antioxidants, nutritional Figure 1. Evergreen Monica Bellucci [224, 225] .

Both factors can greatly enhance the healing capabil -ity of  the skin and can improve the results of  cosmetic surgeries.The Aging ProcessesAging can be viewed as the accumulation of  changes in cells and tissues resulting from a greater disorderliness of  regulatory mech -anisms that result in reduced robustness of  the organism to en -countered stress and disease. The notion of  greater disorderliness in aging is illustrated by the erosion of  the orderly neuroendo -crine feedback regulation of  the secretion of  luteinizing hormone
(LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and growth hormone (GH). These changes are manifested as menopause, andropause, adreno-pause, and somato-pause. Skin aging is part of  the slow decline in appear -ance and function that appears to be attributed in large part to the drastic decline of  hormones in the body after adulthood. At the cellular level, several processes are involved in the physiology of  aging and the development of  some age-related diseases. The process of  apoptosis signifies the process of  nontraumatic and noninflammatory cell death. Dysregulation of  apoptosis has been implicated in the increased incidence of  cutaneous malignancies that are more prevalent in older individuals, such as basal cell car -cinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma. Cell senescence limits cell divisions in normal somatic cells and may play a central role in age-related diseases. Telomeres are thought
to play a role in cellular aging and might contribute to the genetic background of  human aging and longevity. It has been speculated that the limited proliferation potential of  human cells is a result of  the telomere shortening that occurs during DNA synthesis at each cell division. Photoaging may accelerate the shortening of  telomeres and push cells into senescence sooner. That could be the reason why various growth factors may affect the speed and quality of  wound healing. Biochemical insults also arise within aging cells, in part from the action of  reactive oxygen species generated and scavenged incompletely throughout the cell cycle. Aging-associated changes also occur between and among cells via alterations in the intercellular matrix, the intercellular exchange oftrophic factors, the release of  inflammatory cytokine mediators, and the degree of  infiltration by other associated cell types. In addition, the quantity and distribution of  various growth factors
may affect wound healing.Decline of  DNA repair in combination with loss of  melanin increases the risk of  photo-carcinogenesis and can also cause the decline of  enzymatically active melanocytes (10-20% each decade) that contributes to increased sensitivity to UV radiation. However, it is not known why free radical damage does not adversely affect all of  the body’s cells (e.g., gonadal germ cells) [1].Factors Involved in Skin AgingSkin aging is a complex biological process influenced by combi -nation of  endogenous or intrinsic (genetics, cellular metabolism, hormone and metabolic processes) and exogenous or extrinsic (chronic light exposure, pollution, ionizing radiation, chemicals, Figure 2. Desired effect of  anti-aging treatment [2, 243] . The desired therapeutic anti-aging effect of  the skin is continuous, step-by step process, which combines various methods of  the skin

These factors lead together to cumulative struc -tural and physiological alterations and progressive changes in each skin layer as well as changes in skin appearance, especially, on the sun-exposed skin areas [2]. Facial skin wrinkles can be considered as a marker for intrinsic aging ( See wrinkle classification in Ex -hibit 1 ). The major perceived risk factors are unhealthy eating habits, stress, less exercise, dehydration, diseased state and sleep -ing habits. Though the main factor responsible for extrinsic ag -ing is UVR [3]. Beyond sun damage factors such as smoking and atmospheric pollution have also been studied and considered in
extrinsic aging. Studies have shown a clear correlation between these factors and the appearance of  melanosis and wrinkles. Both of  these factors contribute to aging through a common mecha -nism called oxidative stress that has a negative impact on cellular processes, such as DNA replication. In addition to the UV region of  solar radiation that contributes to cellular injury, visible radia -tion has an oxidative effect similar to that of  infrared radiation via heat generation. The effects of  comorbidities, such as metabolic illnesses common in the elderly, nutritional deficiencies, and the use of  drugs such as corticosteroids, and even cancer treatments, should be assessed by dermatologists attending to skin conditions associated with aging [4]. Good skin condition can be maintained to some extent by changes in modifiable lifestyle factors such as smoking and sunscreen use [5]. Human skin cells respond to in -
structions from highly specialized proteins or hormones referred to as growth factors. The growth differentiation factor GDF11, a TGF-β family member, has been associated with the maintenance of  youth phenotypes in different human tissues and organs, and in the skin has been related to an inhibition of  the inflammatory response. The production of  elastin and collagen dermal connec -tive fibers slows, and, with age, the regenerative rates of  GAGs become delayed [6, 7] .PhotodamageChronic repetitive exposure of  human skin to solar UV rays caus -es marked morphological,histological, biochemical, and biophysi -cal changes that are described as photoaging. The clinical signs of  photoaging are fine and coarse wrinkles, actinic keratoses, solar elastosis, yellowing, pigmentation disorders and premalig -nant lesions, skin atrophy, senile purpura, freckles, solar come -dones, telangiectasia, laxity, roughness, and extreme dryness [8].
UV damage can also cause significant changes in some of  the mechanical properties of  the stratum corneum, reducing its cell cohesion and mechanical integrity; the UV radiation also affects the molecular structure of  cell proteins and lipids [4]. According to Leccia et al., 2019, at the cellular level DNA damage is the main event following UV exposure. The kind of  lesions produced de -pends on the wavelength and the energy profile of  the radiation, with different photoproducts being formed as a result. Although endogenous DNA repair mechanisms are somewhat effective in repairing DNA, some DNA damage persists and can accumu -late with chronic exposure [9]. Through ROS formation, UVB induces activator protein-1 (AP-1) overexpression along with the upregulation of  collagen-degrading enzymes like matrix metallo -proteinases (MMPs) (Figure 4). Overall, UVB stimulates collagen degradation and inhibits procollagen biosynthesis resulting in loss
of  collagen content and wrinkle formation, thus inducing skin
proteinases (MMPs) (Figure 4). Overall, UVB stimulates collagen degradation and inhibits procollagen biosynthesis resulting in loss of  collagen content and wrinkle formation, thus inducing skin photoaging, as reported by Karapetsaset al., 2019 [10]. Sun dam -age also creates a state of  chronic inflammation, with the release of  proteolyticenzymes by the inflammatory system, disrupting the dermal matrix [8]. UV protection strategies, such as sunscreen Exhibit 1. Pierard Classification of  Wrinkles [26]• Atrophic wrinkles develop in exposed and non-exposed skin, disappear with skin traction, change in orientation with body posture, and are due to atrophy of  the extracellular matrix.• Elastotic wrinkles develop in sun exposed skin, exhibit solar elastosis, become progressively permanent, and do not disappear with perpendicular traction.• Expressional wrinkles due to subdermal muscle contraction, become permanent with repeated wrin -kling.

Exposure to UV radiation is the primary factor of  extrinsic skin aging; it accounts for about 80% of  facial aging [11].Effects of  UVR on the Dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT) in vitro:  UVR can significantly modulate sWAT metabolism. This effect is observable not only in chronically sun-damaged human skin, but even after a single UV exposure of  a non-damaged skin. Free fatty acid and triglyceride content in sWAT of  sun-exposed skin (forearm) is significantly lower than in the buttocks (sun-protected area) of  the same subjects. At the same time, young
subjects did not demonstrate such differences, which points to the UV-induced effect and not just to the regional variations in fat metabolism. Additionally, both chronic and single UVR ex -posure significantly reduces master adipogenic factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ); this reduc -tion was rapid and remained stable for at least 72 h after acute UVR exposure. From this point of  view dWAT content correlates with a much more pronounced extrinsic aging process in the dor -sal hand comparing to the palm area. Chronological skin aging demonstrates similar but not as pronounced differences in aging processes in palmar and dorsal regions of  the hand. This can be an indication that UVR accelerates the processes of  skin aging, whereas their basic components are determined by some other factors, one of  which could be the local dWAT content. This can make skin aging not only body area dependent, but also spatially
heterogeneous in the same body area, since dWAT can have a spatially heterogeneous structure [78].Environmental factors beyond UV radiationInfrared radiation and heat:  Visible light (400-740 nm) and IR radiation have long been considered to minimally impact the skin, apart from the heat sensation provided by IR radiation [12]. IR radiation accounts for approximately 40% of  the solar radiation energy reaching the earth's surface, subsequently generating heat and increasing skin temperature. IR thermogenic radiation can reach the dermis (65%) and hypodermis (10%), and its capac -ity to induce metalloproteinase expression in the dermis is well known along with its oxidative role. In human skin, IR radiation and heat can lead to macrophage recruitment like UVR. Heat can induce various cytokines in human skin and was found to increase tropoelastin mRNA and protein expression in the epidermis and in the dermis. Both IR and heat-induced acute stress increase in
the number of  mast cells and expression of  tryptase. Chronic IR and heat exposure each induce cutaneous angiogenesis and inflammatory cellular infiltration, disrupts the dermal extracellular matrix by inducing matrix metalloproteinases, and alters dermal structural proteins, thereby adding to premature skin aging [4, 13] . Erythema ab igne, a cutaneous rash characterized by a reticulated pattern of  erythema and hyperpigmentation, is caused by repeat -ed exposure of  direct heat or infrared radiation to a person’s skin, often from occupational exposures or use of  heating pads [14].Pollution:  The damaging effects of  skin exposure to pollutants may result in skin disorders and pathologies, including xerotic skin, sensitive skin, premature skin aging and accelerated aging symptoms, such as wrinkle formation, abnormal pigmentation and skin dryness. Pollutants may also be involved in acne, eczema, skin rashes and skin cancers. Prolonged and repetitive daily expo -
sure to high levels of  pollutants impairs the skin’s natural defense
skin rashes and skin cancers. Prolonged and repetitive daily expo -sure to high levels of  pollutants impairs the skin’s natural defense capacity to some extent. Moreover, some pollutants (e.g., ozone) can induce damage via signal transduction mechanism even when there is no percutaneous penetration to deeper skin layers [227] .There is solid evidence that skin pathologies such as premature aging, atopic dermatitis (AD), and psoriasis are associated with pollutant exposure; all of  these skin conditions are also associated with an altered redox status. Some of  the most noxious pollut -ants that humans are exposed to include ozone (O3), particulate matter and cigarette smoke. Pecorelli et al., 2019 reported that increased levels of  4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE)in the skin, in re -sponse to pollutants, likely accelerates skin aging and exacerbates Exhibit 2.

When ozone exposure precedes UV exposure, there is an enhancement of  UV-induced depletion of  protective vitamin E from the skin’s stratum cor -neum [16]. Even in indoor conditions, particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure levels were positively associated with skin aging mani -festation. Particles can serve as carriers for organic chemicals and metals that are capable of  localizing in mitochondria and generat -ing ROS directly in mitochondria leading to collagen degradation in human skin [17]. In line with this, cosmetic anti-pollution prod -ucts containing anti-oxidants, but also aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AHR) antagonists are effective in reducing or preventing increase in skin pigmentation [18].Lifestyle-related factorsSmoking:  It is now well established that smoking has an aggra -vating effect on skin aging. Even external exposure to cigarette smoke (secondhand cigarette smoke) prematurely ages the skin [4]. Particularly owing to nicotine, smoking negatively affects the dermal microvasculature and hinders the healing process. It also has a toxic effect on keratinocytes and fibroblasts by increasing the expression of  metalloproteins and tropoelastin. Furthermore, smoking increases the expression of  small proteoglycans and re -duces the synthesis of  procollagen. The clinical manifestations of  these phenomena are pale and wrinkled skin; DNA muta -tions also result from oxidative effects or direct toxic damage [8]. Smoking provokes elastosis, telangiectasia, skin roughness, and premature wrinkles on facial skin due to the vascular constriction
of  nicotine. A clear dose-response relationship has been observed between smoking and wrinkling [4].  Park et al., 2018 reported that cigarette smoke induces both ROS production (oxidative stress) and autophagy [19]. It has been observed that the skin of  smoking addicts at the age of  40 years resembles skin of  non-smoking 70-year-old adults. Skin damage due to tobacco smoke is irreversible, where further damage can be avoided by stopping smoking [20]. Wang et al., 2018 reported that application of  to -bacco extracts to skin and oral fibroblasts in vitro  triggered several hallmarks of  senescence including premature cell cycle arrest, oxidative DNA damage, secretion of  inflammatory cytokines and MMPs, and downregulation of  cell junction proteins E-cadherin and Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1, tight junction protein) [21].Sleep:  Restricted sleep affects facial appearance negatively and decreases others' willingness to socialize with the sleep-restricted
person [22]. An estimated 50-70 million American adults suffer from one or more sleep disorders [23]. Sleep is important for growth and renewal of  multiple physiological systems. Oyetakin-White et al., 2015 reported that good sleepers had significantly lower intrinsic skin ageing scores (by SCINEXATM). Sleep dep -rivation is associated with increased signs of  intrinsic skin aging (fine lines, uneven pigmentation, reduced elasticity), with much slower recovery rates after skin barrier disruption and lower sat -isfaction with appearance [24, 25] . The sleep deprived individuals were noted to have hanging eyelids, swollen eyes, darker circles and more droopy corners of  the mouth [23]. Wrinkles occur where fault lines develop in aging skin. Those fault lines may be due to skin distortion resulting from facial expression or may be due to skin distortion from mechanical compression during sleep. Expression wrinkles and sleep wrinkles differ in etiology, location,
due to skin distortion from mechanical compression during sleep. Expression wrinkles and sleep wrinkles differ in etiology, location, and anatomical pattern. Compression, shear, and stress forces act on the face in lateral or prone sleep positions (Figure 6) [26].Diet and Nutrition:  Rhytides, sagging of  skin, and loss of  elas -ticity are all related to changes in the collagen and elastic fibers of  the skin, which are themselves impacted by diet. Ingestion of  sug -ar, in particular, can accelerate these signs of  aging, as it promotes cross-linking of  collagen fibers.This process is accelerated by hy -perglycemia. Research indicates that once established, the body is unable to repair these cross-links.With accumulation of  advanced glycation end products (AGEs), structural changes in the skin can occur, resulting in increased stiffness and reduced elasticity. Cook -ing processes that lead to higher levels of  AGEs include grilling,
frying, and roasting.Herbs and spices, such as oregano, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and garlic, as well as substances found naturally in certain fruits and vegetables, such as lipoic acid inhibit the pro -duction of  AGEs [27]. Frequently researched antioxidants such as Figure 5. Possible role of  adipocyte-myofibroblast transition in extrinsic aging [78].  CHRONIC UV-RADIATIONACUTE SINGLEUV-IRRADIATIONAdipocyteAMTMyofibroblastdWATEnlargementAbsorption of  UV radiation in the skin causes acute enlargement of  the dWAT layer. However, upon chronic overexposure to UV radia -tion, it causes the depletion of  dWAT and a concurrent development of  cutaneous fibrosis, presumably through adipocyte-myofibroblast transition (AMT). Replacement of  dWAT volume with fibrosis leads to production of  mechanically heterogeneous skin structures and to the loss of  the effective skin volume.

The WHO and Food and Agriculture of  the UN reports recommend adults to consume at least five servings of  fruits and vegetables per day excluding starchy vegetables [29]. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 2007-2010 indicate that among US population 75% consumed less fruit and 87% consumed fewer vegetables than recommend -ed [30]. The accumulation of  glycoxidation products such as car -
boxymethyl lysine (CML) and pentosidine in cutaneous collagen promotes skin aging. Bragazzi et al., 2019 reported that chronic caloric restriction decreased the glycation rate of  skin proteins, resulting in the reduction of  age-related accumulation of  these metabolites in cutaneous collagen [31]. Mekić et al, 2019 reported that better adherence to the Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI) was significantly associated with less wrinkles among women but not in men. In women, a red meat and snack-dominant PCA pat -tern was associated with more facial wrinkles, whereas a fruit-dominant principal component analysis (PCA) pattern was asso -ciated with fewer wrinkles [32].Higher intakes of  vitamin C and linoleic acid and lower intakes of  fats and carbohydrates are as -sociated with better skin-aging appearance [33].Inappropriate/Harsh soaps:  Dry skin often occurs in the el -derly and tends to worsen in association with hot baths and the
use of  standard alkaline bar soaps [4]. Skin dryness, scaling and roughness-lipid solvents such as acetone, alcohols and even non -ionic surfactants can cause dryness of  the skin [34]. Each cleans -ing agent, even normal tap water, influences the skin surface. The increase of  the skin pH irritates the physiological protective 'acid mantle', changes the composition of  the cutaneous bacterial flora and the activity of  enzymes in the upper epidermis, which have an acid pH optimum. The dissolution of  fat from the skin sur -face may influence the hydration status leading to a dry and squa -mous skin [35]. Accordingly, in order to lowering the skin damage, cleansings with neutral pH and pH close to 5.5 are recommended [36].Systemic morbiditiesFrom a biochemical standpoint, chronological aging induces in -creased markers of  oxidation, glycoxidation, lipoxidation, and gly -cation in skin collagen. In particular, skin collagen’s cross-linking
lysine residues undergo significant oxidative changes with age. Ly -sine oxidase, a copper-dependent enzyme, converts lysine to ally -sine at all ages. Recently it has been shown that allysine is further oxidized to a stable end product, 2-aminoadipic acid. This oxida -tive change results in significant accumulation of  2-aminoadipic acid in collagen of  aged skin; increased oxidative end product is also seen in diabetes, renal failure, and sepsis. Obesity and over -weight are risk factors for various disorders, including diabetes [38].Diabetes mellitus (DM):  Yoon et al, 2002 reported that elastic -ity of  facial skin was decreased in patients with diabetes. Decrease of  the fine flakes of  the diabetes patients reflect that irritation and xerotic changes are aggravated in skins of  diabetic patients [44].DM is among the most common aging-related comorbidities, and the generation of  advanced glycation end products is inti -

mately related to dermal damage since it changes the properties of  collagen types I and IV . Clinically, reductions in flexibility and rigidity and an increase in susceptibility to mechanical stimula -tion are observed [4]. 30-70% of  patients with DM, both type 1 and type 2, will present with a cutaneous complication of  DM at some point during their lifetime. The prevalence of  ichthyosi -form changes of  the shins (“fish scale” skin) in those with type 1 diabetes has been reported to be between 25-50%. Xerosis is one of  the most common skin presentations (abnormally dry skin) in patients with diabetes and has been reported to be present in as many as 40% of  patients with diabetes [37]. Uruska et al., 2019 reported a two-way relationship between insulin resistance and AGE accumulation in the skin in people with Type 1 diabetes [39] which is related with increased stiffness and reduced elastic -ity. Moreover, not only collagen, but also elastin, is affected by
AGEs, resulting in a reduction of  skin elasticity. Pageon et al., Figure 6. External forces (including compression, tension, and shear) act on facial tissue in lateral or prone sleep positions [26]. COMPRESSIONTENSIONSHEARDuring side or stomach sleeping, facial tissue is subject to shear, compression, and tensile mechanical forces. The skin is stretched and pulled in all directions with changes in sleep position. These forces become significant when we consider the amount of  time spent in sleep and sleep position.

Noordam et al, 2013 reported higher glucose levels are associated with a higher perceived ageamong non-diabetic subjects also. Sev -eral studies have shown that culturing human fibroblasts under hyperglycemic conditions results in both an increased amount of  ROS at a cellular level as well as an increased induction of  prema -ture cellular senescence which in turn may cause premature skin aging and a higher perceived age(Figure 7) [41-43] . People can use medication to resolve skin problems, but managing blood sugars
is usually the best way to prevent and treat skin problems that relate to diabetes [244] .Obesity:  A hyperglycemic state is common in obesity and is as -sociated with peripheral resistance to insulin and a higher risk of  glycation [45]. Also, Sami et al., 2015 reported that skin of  the patients with massive weight loss is weak due to lower density and thickness of  collagen fibers and damage to its elastic fibers. It usually occurs because of  damage of  collagen and elastin, which allows for no skin retraction after weight loss [46]. Striae distensae (striae or stretch marks) is a common dermatosis in patients with obesity, representing linear atrophic plaques which are created due to tension and skin stretching from expanding fat deposits. Due to excessive sweating and increased friction between skin surfaces, a number of  skin infections are more frequent in obesity includ -ing oppositional intertrigo (inflammation-rash in body folds),
candidiasis, candida folliculitis, folliculitis and less often cellulitis, erysipelas or fasciitis [47]. Ibuki et al., 2017 reported that obese-diabetes patients have decreased stratum corneum hydration, in -creased transepidermal water loss, higher skin advanced glycation end-products and decreased dermal collagen fiber density com -pared with normal-weight subjects. These results indicate that the ordinary age-related physiological skin changes seen in the elderly can also occur in obese-diabetes patients aged in their 40s [48].Menopause:  The effects of  estrogen deficiency on the skin are an important endogenous cause of  aging skin in women. Estro -gen’s key role in maintaining the skin’s structural and functional integrity is well established with evidence that shows that estro -gens are essential for skin hydration, sebum production, improved barrier function of  the stratum corneum, and increased collagen
and elastin content [49]. Following menopause many women de -tect a swift commencement of  skin aging; skin becomes thinner with decreased collagen content, decreased elasticity, increased wrinkling and increased dryness [50]. Reduced estrogen levels during menopause affect skin components with estrogen recep -tors, particularly in epidermal cells and sebaceous glands. By contrast, androgenic hormone levels do not decline significantly during this period [4]. Accordingly, dermal cellular metabolism is influenced by the hypoestrogenoemic state of  menopause leading to changes in the collagen content, alterations in the concentra -tion of  glycoaminoglycans and most importantly the water con -tent. Consequently, changes in these basic components leads to an alteration in function compatible with skin aging. Changes in the skin collagen leads to diminished elasticity and skin strength. Collagen content may be measured by various methods such as
direct skin biopsy, skin blister assessment for collagen markers
the skin collagen leads to diminished elasticity and skin strength. Collagen content may be measured by various methods such as direct skin biopsy, skin blister assessment for collagen markers and skin thickness measurement. All these variables indicate a re -duction in collagen content following menopause. This may be reversed with the administration of  estrogen given both topically and systemically.A reduction in hydrophilic glycoaminglycans leads to a direct reduction in water content, which influences the skin turgor [51]. A study of  elderly males and females has con -firmed that administration of  topical estrogen increases keratino -cyte proliferation and epidermal thickness after only two weeks. In estrogen deficient women skin thickness is reduced by 1.13% and collagen content by 2% per postmenopausal year. Type I and III skin collagen is thought to decrease by as much as 30% in the first five years after menopause.This decrease in skin thick -
ness and collagen content in elderly females correlates with the period of  estrogen deficiency rather than chronological age [50]. The highest loss (of  up to 30%) is observed in the first 5 years, followed by a 1%-2% loss of  collagen annually [171] .Acne scarring:  Skin with acne scarring has reduced elasticity due to scar fibrosis and shows a worsened appearance of  furrows and wrinkles.Atrophic facial acne scarring is a widely prevalent condi -tion that can have a negative impact on a patient's quality of  life. The appearance of  these scars is often worsened by the normal effects of  aging. Facial aging often exacerbates the effects of  acne scarring. Inflammation associated with moderate to severe acne can result in dermal collagen and fat loss, leading to atrophic scar -ring. Both acne scarring and the normal aging process can result in the loss of  dermal collagen and facial lipoatrophy, such that
patients already suffering from the negative impact of  facial acne scarring may find the appearance of  these scars worsening over time as they approach their 40s and 50s [52].Figure 7.

Prolonged activation of  these pathways can result in chronic immune dysfunction, increased production of  ROS, and DNA damage, which are known to contribute to the again of  skin and other tissues [53]. Maarouf  et al., 2019 reported simi -lar observation of  aberrant barrier dysfunction, characterized by decreased epidermal lipid and structural protein production, de -
creased stratum corneum hydration and increased transepidermal water loss [54]. Liu et al., 2018 reported that early life adversity is associated with both persistent disruptions in the hypothalam -ic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and psychiatric symptoms. Glu -cocorticoid receptors (GRs), which are encoded by the NR3C1 gene, bind to cortisol and other glucocorticoids to create a nega -tive feedback loop within the HPA axis to regulate the body's neu -roendocrine response to stress. Excess methylation of  a promoter sequence within NR3C1 that attenuates GR expression, however, has been associated with both early life adversity and psychopa -thology. As critical regulators within the HPA axis, GRs and their epigenetic regulation may mediate the link between early life ad -versity and the onset of  psychopathology [55].Hormone and metabolic processesAll endocrine glands are affected by the global aging process. A
few direct consequences interfere with skin aging. They are most -ly related to the declined activity of  the pituitary gland, adrenal glands, ovaries, and testes [56]. The most important endocrine compound produced by the skin is vitamin D, which is aregulator of  the calcium metabolism and exhibits other systemic effects as well. Vitamin D3 and its analogues regulates several physiologi -cal processes in the skin-like proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of  keratinocytes and maintenance of  normal skin bar -riers and immune system [57]. Extension of  health-span in ex -perimental animals and analysis of  survival curves suggest that in the absence of  Growth hormone (GH), aging is slowed down or delayed. The peripheral effects of  GH are mainly exerted by insulin-like growth factor (IGF), produced by the liver upon GH stimulation. The circulating IGF-1 is bioavailable and functionally active depending upon its binding with the IGF-binding proteins
(IGF-BPs) [58]. Eto et al., 2018 reported severe GH deficiency results in early aging, such as wrinkling and dryness of  skin [59]. Hypopituitary adults are usually described as having dry and thin skin, an increase in skin thickness was demonstrated after GH treatment in normal elderly males selected on the basis of  low IGF-I levels [60]. The progressive decline in dehydroepiandros -terone (DHEA) serum concentration with age, and conversely its supplementation has not demonstrated prominent effects on the skinexcept on sebum production [56]. DHEA is the major ster -oid produced by the adrenal zona reticularis and, in contrast to cortisol and aldosterone, its secretion declines with ageing [61].DHEA and its sulfate (DHEA-S) are the most abundant ster -oids in humans whose low levels are related to aging, greater in -cidence of  various cancers, immune dysfunction, atherosclerosis, and osteoporosis [62]. Calvo et al., 2008 strongly suggested the
possibility that DHEA could exert an anti-aging effect in the skin
and osteoporosis [62]. Calvo et al., 2008 strongly suggested the possibility that DHEA could exert an anti-aging effect in the skin through stimulation of  collagen biosynthesis, improved struc -tural organization of  the dermis while modulating keratinocyte metabolism [63]. Estrogen, alone or together with progesterone, prevents or reverses skin atrophy, dryness, and wrinkles associated with chronological aging or photoaging. Estrogen and progester -one stimulate proliferation of  keratinocytes while estrogen sup -presses apoptosis and thus prevents epidermal atrophy. Estrogen also enhances collagen synthesis, and estrogen and progesterone suppress collagenolysis by reducing MMP activity in fibroblasts, thereby maintaining skin thickness.

Several reports suggest positive correlations between the levels of  circulating estrogens and: (1) perceived age, (2) attractiveness, (3) enhanced skin health, and (4) facial coloration in women [65]. Topical corticosteroids have been shown to reduce cutaneous CD44 expression, corre -lated with skin atrophy if  there’s a CD44 deficiency. Corticoster -oids can also induce dermatoporotic changes through modulating gene expression of  collagen I, collagen III, collagen IV , and ma -trix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [66]. The corticosteroid-induced
atrophy can be one of  the most severe forms of  skin aging cor -responding to dermatoporosis.Other Intrinsic Issues of  agingAnatomical Skin Sites:  Large variations in some skin proper -ties (hydration, transepidermal water loss, epidermallipids, sebum secretion, and mechanical properties) have been observed with respect to thestudied body site. There are also large differences in skin thickness in function of  the body site,ranging from very thin on the eyelids to more than 5 mm on the sole of  the feet. A regionalvariation is clearly observed when considering the quan -tity and composition of  lipids in thestratum corneum. Because of  thickness and sebum secretion, the viscoelastic properties of  theskin is very different at the forehead, nose, and cheeks compared with the forearm [8]. Human skin retains water mostly through the outermost stratum corneum layer. Loss of  hydration in aged skin, due to a decline in function of  the stratum corneum, results
in a sagging and wrinkling appearance [77].Ethnicity:  Campiche et al., 2019 reported that Africans from the African continent show delayed signs of  aging compared to Cau-casians [67]. Facial wrinkles and ne lines appear later in African Americans than in Caucasians and may not appear until late in the fifth or sixth decade. White women self-reported more signs of  moderate and severe facial aging than Asian and Hispanic women beginning in the fourth decade. When comparing the severity of  facial features against photo-numeric rating scales, the mean se -verity of  crow’s feet lines was most severe in Fitzpatrick skin type I and least severe in Fitzpatrick skin types IV and V [68]. Asians are a population with various skin phototypes, ranging from type III to IV Fitzpatrick's classification in Chinese and Japanese to type IV and V in Indian and Pakistani people. Chan et al., 2019 reported that Asian skin tends to present post-inflammatory hy -
perpigmentation, melasma, lentigines and freckles, nevus of  Ota, and Hori nevus. The main skin diseases reported in Asians are acne, atopic dermatitis, and viral infections. Wrinkles and skin thickness, early signs of  aging in Caucasians, are less evident in Asian skin. However, pigmentary changes occur earlier [69]. Asian and black skin has thicker and more compact dermis than white skin, with the thickness being proportional to the degree of  pigmentation. This likely contributes to the lower incidence of  facial rhytides in Asians and blacks [70]. Signs of  facial aging in individuals with skin of  color tend to be most pronounced in the periorbital and midface region with less prominent features of  skin aging in the upper third of  the face and a decreased ten -dency toward perioral rhytides and radial lip lines [71]. Darker skin types are better protected regarding sun exposure due to the higher melanin content in their skin. In fair-skinned persons the
dency toward perioral rhytides and radial lip lines [71]. Darker skin types are better protected regarding sun exposure due to the higher melanin content in their skin. In fair-skinned persons the skin appears severely atrophic with multiple teleangiectasis and a variety of  premalignant lesions such as actinic keratosis, whereas in dark-skinned persons deep furrows and severe solar elastosis occur [72].Gender:  Sugawara et al., 2019 reported cauliflower-shaped seba -ceous glands in male while young females had somewhat more cy -lindrical and smaller sebaceous glands than the young males [73].There are significant morphological differences according tosex: total skin thickness is greater for men on most skin sites [56]. Also, increased sebum and decreased skin elasticity were mostly correlated with facial pore development in male [74]. Rahrovanet al., 2018 reported SC rehydration capacity in sun-exposed aged
female subjects was significantly lower than that of  age-matched male subjects.The skin parameters of  hydration, transepidermal water loss, sebum, microcirculation, pigmentation, and thickness are generally higher in men but skin pH is higher in women [75].Trojahn et al., 2015 reported that changes in skin elasticity, wrin -kling, sagging, and yellowness seem to be caused by additional extrinsic ageing in women. Intrinsic ageing has a very strong influ -ence on facial skin characteristics in Caucasian women in general [76].Skin Aging Prevention and TherapyAnti-aging in dermatology primarily focuses on the prevention of  skin aging with UV protection (clothing and sunscreens), free rad -ical scavengers (synthetic or botanic), and cell-protecting agents such as vitamin B3. For the correction of  signs of  early skin ag -ing, retinoic acid derivatives in dermatological prescriptions are the best studied substances. Topical hormonal prescriptions are
also an option if  UV damage has not been the leading culprit for aging. Chemical peeling leads to a marked increase in collagen formation, the deeper the better. Ingredients in cream prepara -tions can reduce superficial skin folds (polyphenols, amino acid peptides). Modulators of  regular pigmentation are important for anti-aging preparations [79]. There are no proven effective topical antiaging ingredients/or treatment that completely eliminates the symptoms of  skin photoaging, but there are products and treat -ments that can visibly reduce or slow down these symptoms: it is more correct to consider reduction of  the appearance of  aged skin. Many cosmetic products claim to reduce the clinical signs of  photoaged skin; however, there are very few scientific, rand -omized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical studies to sup -Exhibit 4.

Generally speaking, the quality control testing on ingredients and safety testing are of  good quality, and the used ingredients are mostly safe. However, these ingredients may not be as efficient as claimed, and the concentrations used in these formulations will not necessarily correspond to an “effective” concentration. This can be the case with many plant extracts with antioxidant properties [8]. Indeed, product testing may also be warranted by the companies to document claimed efficacy and to support marketing. Finally, many antiaging claims are based on in vivo testing on cells orsimple skin models but not in vivo on a
sufficient number of  human subjects.Cosmetological careDaily skin care:  Healthy and functioning skin barrier is important protector against dehydration, penetration of  various microor -ganisms, allergens, irritants, reactive oxygen species and radiation. The skin barrier may be specifically adjusted to allow penetra -tion. For this reason, daily skin care may increase skin regenera -tion, elasticity, smoothness, and thus temporarily change the skin condition [2]. Protection, prevention, cleansing, and moisturizing are the key components of  an effective skincare routine. Because most sun damage results from every day, incidental UV exposure, rather than occasional bursts while on vacation, dermatologists recommend daily use of  sunscreens. In general, gel-based and bar cleansers are best for oily complexions, whereas cream or lotion-based ones are better for normal to dry skin. Moisturizers supply humectant agents, which draw water into the stratum corneum
from the environment and dermis below. Moisturizers also in -clude occlusive agents that act as a barrier to trans-epidermal wa -ter loss. In almost all cases, products contain both humectants, like hyaluronic acid, urea, and allantoin, and occlusives, including petrolatum, mineral oil, and lanolin. The classical moisturizers are used for treating dryness in the photoaged skin: polyols (glycerin, propylene glycol, butylene glycol and sorbitol), urea, lactic acid and salts, hyaluronic and salts, pyrrolodone-5-carboxylic acid and salts, panthenol, amino acids and proteins (collagen and proteins from wheat, rice, silk, soybean, and oat). More sophisticated pep-tides and proteins are presently used as moisturizers. It concerns generally more lipophylic quaternary N-alkyl derivatives of  pro -teins or small polypeptides with long side chains (ester binding)
to increase the lipophilic character: binding to the horny layer and a better percutaneous absorption. Recently, the use of  small pep -tides, which mimic the amino acid sequence of  collagen or en -zymes (biomimetic peptides), has been proposed as moisturizers [56]. Surface-smoothing silicone derivatives or filmogen proteins such as quaternized proteins orsilk, rice and oat, and skin feel agents are used in antiaging products. The high adsorption to the skin surface provokes a smoothing of  the skin surface and is at the same time humectant. For a better percutaneous penetration, small fragments of  hyaluronic acid were also suggested.  Humec-tants are present in the water phase of  a formula; occlusives are in the oil phase. Oil in water formulations tend to be lightweight gels, lotions, and serums and are best suited for normal to dry skin. Water in oil formulations may be ointments or creams and offer superior hydration for dry skin [80].

offer superior hydration for dry skin [80].Correct Sun-Protection:  Singer et al., 2019 reported that avoid -ance of  sun exposure at peak times and textile sun protection are important pillars of  a modern prophylactic approach. Be -sides, antioxidants and DNA repair enzymes may be added to topical sunscreens in order to enhance the protection before and even after sun exposure [81]. The FDA regulates sunscreen as an over-the-counter medication. Currently, 16 UV filters are listed, 14 organic filters and two nonorganic filters, including zinc ox -ide and titanium dioxide. The FDA has changed its guidelines to address broad-spectrum sunscreen use, which involves UVA and UVB coverage; water resistance, to indicate the time duration the sunscreen is effective; and sun protection factor (SPF). SPF-30 or higher is recommended and can be labeled as reducing the risk of  skin cancer and early skin aging [82, 83] . Nutritional antioxi -
dants act through different mechanisms and in different compart -ments, but are mainly FR scavengers: (a) they directly neutralize free radicals (b) they reduce the peroxide concentrations and re -pair oxidized membranes (c) they quench iron to decrease ROS production (d) via lipid metabolism, short-chain free fatty acids and cholesteryl esters neutralize ROS. The most important source of  antioxidants is provided by nutrition. To the most known sys -temic antioxidants belong vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, and from the trace elements copper and selenium. There are also stud -ies demonstrating that vitamins C and E combined with ferulic acid impart both a sunscreen and an anti-oxidant effect [2].Aesthetic non-invasive procedures:  Noninvasive skin tight -Exhibit 5.

According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) surveys released in 2014 and 2015, there has been a 12% increase in the demand for cosmetic procedures, with Americans spending more than $12 billion and having 10 billion procedures in 2014 [84]. A noninva -sive device combines multipolar RF and PEMFs and is referred as (MP)2, which stands for “Multipolar Magnetic Pulse.” The device was introduced for the non-ablative treatment of  skin laxity and cellulite [85]. Lee et al., 2014 reported that combined multi-polar
radio frequency and pulsed electromagnetic field device is safe and effective for rejuvenating aged skin in Korean subjects [88].Pulsed electromagnetic fields  (PEMFs) are induced by short pulses of  electrical current that penetrates into the skin and results in the stimulation of  molecular and cellular activities. It has been used in medicine for bone growth, wound healing, cardiovascular dis -ease, and other conditions. Pulsed electromagnetic fields increase collagen fiber production by dermal fibroblasts and stimulate an -giogenesis, leading to wound-healing effects. Radiofrequency  (RF) devices remain a dominant technology in the noninvasive man -agement of  skin aging, as it is a safe and effective treatment for a broad range of  skin conditions. It can induce wrinkle reduc -tion, cellulite improvement, laxity and body, and skin contouring improvement. When radio frequency is applied by an alternating
current, an electric field is generated, which achieves skin tissues, generating thermal energy. The heat is not diminished by tissue diffraction or absorption by epidermal melanin and is then ap -propriate for treatment of  all skin types [85, 86] . RF with micro-needling is effective and safe in improving skin laxity and texture. Pairing skincare cosmeceutical products pre- and post-procedure is beneficial as it enhances patient results, patient experience, and reduces patient downtime. Zahr et al., 2019 reported that com -bining the multi-ingredient anti-aging facial moisturizer pre- and post-RF microneedling was safe and tolerable for the patients [226] .Figure 8. The Venus Legacy noninvasive skin tightening device [86, 87] .The medical device is used in non-invasive body shaping, cellulite reduction, skin tightening, and wrinkle reduction for the face and body. The device is
powered by (MP)2 technology, which combines Multi-Polar Radio Frequency and Pulsed Electro Magnetic Fields, and features the advanced technology that induces lipolysis, allows for increased blood circulation, and stimulates lymphatic drainage in the treatment area.Exhibit 6.

In addition, there is a normalization and enhancement of  elasticity. Improvement of  skin tone and texture is a benefit of  vitamin A, which enhanc -es skin lightening when used in conjunction with skin lighteners [95]. The most widely utilized ones include retinol, retinyl esters (e.g., retinyl acetate, retinyl propionate, and retinyl palmitate), and retinaldehyde. Through endogenous enzymatic reactions, all of  these are converted ultimately to trans-retinoic acid (trans-RA),
which is the active form of  vitamin A in skin. Specifically, reti -nyl esters are converted to retinol via esterases. Retinol (ROL) is then converted to retinaldehyde by retinol dehydrogenase. And finally, retinaldehyde is oxidized to RA by retinaldehyde oxidase.Retinol and retinal must be metabolized in the skin to the active trans-retinoic acid. The incorporation of  retinol and probably also retinal in cosmetic preparations poses the problem of  stabil -ity (slow oxidation of  retinol in function of  time) [8, 90] . Topical natural retinoic acid precursors such as retinaldehyde or ROL are less irritant than acidic retinoids. Retinoids may be combined with other compounds with complementary actions against ageing, nu -tritional deficiency and cancer, such as antioxidants, to potentiate their beneficial effects in the skin [100] .The molecular mechanisms by which retinoids improve aged human skin have been difficult to investigate largely due to lack
of  appropriate in vitro models. Shao et al., 2017 reported that topical application of  0.4% ROL to aged human skin leads to remarkable skin changes in both epidermis and dermis through affecting three major types of  skin cells, epidermal keratinocytes, dermal endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Topical ROL significantly increases epidermal thickness by stimulating epidermal keratino -cytes proliferation, which involves c-Jun transcription factor, a major deriving force for keratinocyte proliferation. In addition to epidermal changes, topical ROL significantly improves dermal ECM microenvironment; increasing dermal blood vessel forma -tion by stimulating endothelial cells proliferation and ECM pro -duction by activating fibroblasts. Topical ROL also stimulates TGF-β/CTGF pathway, the major regulator of  ECM homeo -stasis, and thus increased the deposition of  mature collagen in aged human skin in vivo.Additionally, the restoration of  dermal
ECM may provide a better, more permissive environment for the proliferation of  dermal endothelial cells and epidermal ke -ratinocytes, and activation of  dermal fibroblasts (TGF-β/CTGF pathway). Coupling of  the proliferation of  keratinocytes and endothelial cells, and dermal fibroblasts activation forms a self-enforcing environment, which might explain the remarkable anti-aging effects of  ROL in aged human skin [94]. Kong et al., 2016 reported that ROL anti-aging effects include the inhibition of  UV-induction of  matrix metalloproteinases, and the promotion of  collagen synthesis in photoaged skin [5, 10] . In clinical stud -ies, topical retinol treatment significantly improved fine wrinkles [11]. and affected markers of  photoaging, including matrix met -alloproteinase, collagenase, and collagen [12]. Retinol was effec -tive in producing retinoid-mediated histological changes, such as keratinocyte proliferation [96]. Bagatin et al., 2018 reported that
treatments with adapalene 0.3% gel and tretinoin 0.05% cream in
keratinocyte proliferation [96]. Bagatin et al., 2018 reported that treatments with adapalene 0.3% gel and tretinoin 0.05% cream in cutaneous photoaging did not differ significantly regarding clini -cal evaluation of  the following criteria: global cutaneous photoag -ing, periorbital wrinkles, ephelides/melanosis, forehead wrinkles, and actinic keratosis. They concluded that adapalene 0.3% gel is a safe and effective option for the treatment of  mild or moder -ate photoaging [97]. Tretinoin is a prescription strength retinoid approved by the US FDA for acne and for the mitigation of  fine facial wrinkles, mottled hyperpigmentation, and tactile roughness of  facial skin. Topical application of  tretinoin inhibits AP-1, thus suppressing the expression of  MMPs and preventing the degrada -tion of  collagen. An increase in epidermal thickness and anchor -ing fibrils is observed, and intrinsically aged skin may also benefit
from the topical application of  retinoids. Prescription strength tretinoin affords the most potent retinoid effects, but often results in limited utility and decreased adherence due to irritation reac -tions (ie, burning, scaling, and dermatitis) [11, 91, 98] . Bakuchiol is a meroterpene phenol abundant in seeds and leaves of  the plant Psoralea corylifolia . Chaudhuri et al., 2014 reported that bakuchiol, having no structural resemblance to retinoids, can function as a functional analogue of  retinol. Volcano plots showed great overall similarity of  retinol and bakuchiol effects on the gene expression profile [101] .Dhaliwal et al., 2019 reported that demonstrates that bakuchiol is comparable with retinol in its ability to improve pho -toageing and is better tolerated than retinol. Bakuchiol is prom -ising as a more tolerable alternative to retinol (bakuchiol 0•5% cream twice daily or retinol 0•5% cream daily) [102] . Kwon et al.,
2018 reported that retinaldehyde 0.1% and 0.05% creams used to treat photoaged skin both were well tolerated and improved skin hydration and texture. Retinaldehyde 0.1% cream improved the melanin index as well [99]. An improvement of  thephotoaged dermal matrix by topical application of  a cosmetic “antiaging” product containing ali poentapeptide, white lupin, and retinyl pal -mitate was reported by Watson et al., 2008 [142] . Also, synthetic retinyl-N-formyl aspartame has also been demonstrated to im -prove skin roughness and wrinkles. However, studies of  retinyl esters, such as retinyl palmitate and retinyl propionate fail to show good efficacy [105] .α-Hydroxy Acids (AHAs):  Hydroxy acids, also called fruit acids, are among non-organic acids which have been used in the treat -ment of  skin disorders since about 50 years ago. They are some Figure 9. Improvements in skin condition [85].

AHAs act on both the epidermal and the dermal levels. When applied to the skin, AHAs stimulate the exfoliation of  epi-dermal cells in the stratum corneum by interfering with the ionic bonding between these cells. This results in the sloughing off  dull and rough skin and promotes cellular renewal. Initially used for treatment of  hyperkeratosis and other skin conditions affecting subcutaneous turnover, AHAs were found to promote softer, smoother skin, faded wrinkles, lightened age spots, and decreased blemishes. AHAs also improve the subcutaneous barrier function,
increase epidermal proliferation and thickness, and restore hydra -tion and pursiness through an increase in hyaluronic acid. The well-known benefits of  AHA’s include exfoliation, moisturization, reduction of  fine lines and wrinkles, collagen synthesis, firming and skin lightening. Although these naturally occurring organic acids are often referred to as fruit acids because they are found in many common fruits such as citrus fruits (citric acid), apples (malic acid), and grapes (tartaric acid), the two most widely used AHAs are not components of  fruit. Glycolic acid (GA) is a sugar cane derivative, and lactic acid (LA) is derived from milk [95], [103] .Glycolic acid (GA):  Tang et al., 2019 demonstrated that GA re -duced UVB-induced type-I procollagen expression and secretory collagen levels, when applied topically onto human keratinocytes and the C57BL/6J mice dorsal skin. The UV-induced MMP-9 level and activity were reduced by GA pre-treatment. Concomi -
tantly, GA reverted mitogen-activated protein kinase (MMP-9) activation and inhibited the extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation (p38, pERK) triggered by UVB. Finally, GA triggers the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV-1) channel to initiate the anti-photoaging mechanism in keratinocytes. These findings clearly indicated that the mechanisms of  GA promote skin protection against UVB-induced photoaging and wrinkle formation [104] . Application of  5% GA cream for 3 months has been shown to improve skin texture and discoloration of  photo -aged skin. In another study, 8% (glycolic acid or L-lactic acid) for 22 weeks, the majority of  patients (76% for glycolic acid; 71% for lactic acid) reported a noticeable improvement in the appear -ance and smoothness of  photoaged skin [105] . In a study of  50% GA peels by Newman et al., there was improvement in mild photoaging of  skin. Other significant improvements were noted,
including decreases in rough texture and fine wrinkling, fewer so -lar keratoses, and slight lightening of  solar lentigines. Histologic analysis showed thinning of  the stratum corneum, granular layer enhancement, and epidermal thickening. Some specimens showed an increase in collagen thickness in the dermis. GA peels do not affect deep wrinkles or deep pigmentations [106] .Lactic Acid (LA):  Lactic acid (as sodium lactate) is a well-known part of  the skin’s natural moisturizing complex, and is considered to be an excellent moisturizer. LA also contributes to the cell cycle in human keratinocytes [107] . Treatment with 12% LA resulted in increased epidermal and dermal firmness and thickness and clinical improvement in skin smoothness and in the appearance of  lines and wrinkles. Both the lactic and glycolic acid peelings were effective in reducing fine wrinkles on the external-lateral re -gion of  the eyes, after three applications (85% LA versus 70%
GA) [109] . Recently more attention has been drawn to alpha hy -
were effective in reducing fine wrinkles on the external-lateral re -gion of  the eyes, after three applications (85% LA versus 70% GA) [109] . Recently more attention has been drawn to alpha hy -droxy and polyhydroxy acids (AHA and PHA) due to their excel -lent moisturizing and antioxidant properties. Algiert-Zielińska et al., 2019 reported maintenance of  the epidermal barrier integrity during application of  lactic acid (LA) and lactobionic acid and the opportunity to use them on sensitive skin types including coup -erose skin [112] . One of  the reasons lactic acid is widely used as exfoliator and chemical peeling agent is its profound effect on desquamation of  the skin. Desquamation is due to the dissocia -tion of  the cellular adhesions, which occurs as a result of  reduced calcium ion concentration in the epidermis by chelating action of  AHAs [113] . Yamamoto et al., 2006 also showed that LA not only increased the production of  ceramide in the stratum corneum,
but also appeared to improve the ratio of  ceramide 1-linoleate to oleate as compared to vehicle following 1-month topical ap -plication of  4% L-lactic acid. The increased ratio of  ceramide 1-linoleate to oleate has been suggested to play an important role in increasing skin barrier function [114] .β-Hydroxy Acids (BHAs):  Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHAs), such Figure 10.

In the other hands, they are lipid-soluble in contrast to water solubility of  AHAs. This structure allows them to penetrate into the skin through sebaceous follicles, making it appropriate for patients with oily skin and open comedones. In addition to prove anti-inflammatory effect of  BHAs (e.g. salicylic acid), the skin irritancy effect of  them have also been proved to be less than AHAs. Beta hydroxy acid found in skin-care products works best in a concentration of  1-2% [103] . Salicylic acid (SA) is a BHA, which has action to normal keratinization, decreases
inflammation, and reduces sebum production with a comedolytic effect. The concentration of  salicylic to treat acne is 0.5-5% [116] . SA has been used in the treatment of  photoaging with in-office peels of  20–30%. These can be quite helpful in patients who are unable to tolerate AHAs since irritancy levels tend to be less with salicylic acid. In addition, it can be quite useful to combine or alternate both AHAs and BHAs since their mechanisms of  action differ, and using both may be quite beneficial [95]. Vender et al., 2019 reported that daily use of  a ceramide containing cleanser and cream that also has SA offers an effective, easy and com -fortable option for dry skin conditions. After treatment subjects reported a significant improvement in the quality of  their profes -sional life, self-image, and social life. The products were shown to be safe, comfortable, and well tolerated [115] . Shamalnasab et al.,
2018 reported that salicylates activate adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK), which is now considered as a promis -ing target to slow down aging and prevent age-related diseases in humans [116] . A topical combination containing 10.4% L-lactic acid, 2% salicylic acid and alpha-hydroxy acid/retinoate conjugate (ethyl lactyl retinoate) was used in the topical treatment of  fe -males of  ages 20 to 58. After 4 weeks, improvement was achieved, which remained continuous and cumulative in the eighth week [97].2% supramolecular salicylic acid has a similar efficacy with 5% benzoyl peroxide 0.1% adapalene in mild to moderate acne treatment. The skin barrier (skin hydration value and TEWL val -ue), skin brightness (L* value) and erythema (a* values) indicators showed similar statistical improvement [118] .Ascorbic Acid (AA):  Vitamin C is a water-soluble antioxidant which protects skin from oxidative damage and rejuvenates pho -
to-aged skin. It has been utilized as a skin lightener (e.g., via ty -rosinase inhibition and/or its antioxidant effect). It also has been reported to have anti-inflammatory properties since it reduces the erythema associated with post-operative laser resurfacing. In addi -tion, AA also serves as an essential co-factor for the enzymes lysyl hydroxylase and prolyl hydroxylase, both of  which are required for posttranslational processing in collagen (Types I and III) bio -synthesis. Thus, by stimulating these biosynthetic steps, ascorbic acid will increase the production of  collagen which will lead to wrinkle reduction [90]. Vitamin C deficient individuals may ex -perience easy bleeding, bruising, and poor wound healing [130] .In addition, topical vitamin C increases levels of  tissue inhibitors of  collagen-degrading matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) [95]. Normal skin contains high concentrations of  vitamin C, which
supports important and well-known functions, stimulating colla -gen synthesis and assisting in antioxidant protection against UV-
Normal skin contains high concentrations of  vitamin C, which supports important and well-known functions, stimulating colla -gen synthesis and assisting in antioxidant protection against UV-induced photodamage. Vitamin C uptake from the plasma and transport across the skin layers is mediated by specific sodium-de -pendent vitamin C transporters (SVCTs) that are present through -out the body and are also responsible for transport into other tissues. Interestingly, cells in the epidermis express both types of  vitamin C transporter, SVCT1 and SVCT2 (Figure 8) [131] .Garre et al., 2018 reported that topical serum containing L-Ascorbic acid, soluble proteoglycans, low molecular weight hya -luronic acid, and a tripeptide protected against oxidative damage and dermal protein loss caused by photo- and chronological ag -ing in human skin explants. In-vivo , the serum hydrated skin for 6 hours, and users perceived increased skin brightness, hydration,
and fewer wrinkles [126] . Zasada et al., 2019 reported that 2.5 ml of  serum containing 20% L-ascorbic acid with hydrate from strawberries was used topically in every of  4 treatments. The im -pact of  active substance on skin firmness and elasticity as well as the degree of  hydration and skin tone was more efficient af -ter micro-needle mesotherapy [127] . Wang et al., 2019 reported 2-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-l-ascorbic acid (AA-2βG), a unique AA derivative identified in Lyciumbarbarum, exhibited enhanced free radical scavenging activity compared with AA and its synthetic de -rivative AA-2αG.AA-2βG protected hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death in murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Treatment with AA-2βG eliminated oxidative stress and the ratio of  cellular glu -tathione to glutathione disulfide more effectively than AA and AA-2αG [128] . Gęgotek et al., 2019 reported three times higher antioxidant properties of  than rutin, measured by the cation radi -
cal scavenging activity by the ferric-reducing activity of  plasma (FRAP) test. However, the mixture of  ascorbic acid and rutin Figure 11.

The F–C test showed that AA + Rutin acted two times stronger than AA. or Rutin alone [129] . Crisan et al., 2015 reported topically applied vitamin C (concentration of  5% and a pH of  5.5 in a novel complex with Rosa moschata , the musk rose oil and proteoglycans) is highly ef -ficient as a rejuvenation therapy, inducing significant collagen syn -thesis in all age groups with minimal side effects [132] .Vitamin E:  The very properties that make alpha-tocopherol such a powerful antioxidant causes it to break down in the presence of
oxygen or upon exposure to light. For that reason, α-tocopherol acetate, which is the more stable esterified form, is used in cos -metics. Since α-tocopherol acetate is not an antioxidant and has no antioxidant activity, it must first convert to its active alpha-tocopherol form. Years of  debate questioned the ability of  alpha-tocopherol acetate to be delivered to the skin and bio-converted to an active form. Finally, in 1990, the bioconversion of  alpha-to -copherol acetate to free alpha-tocopherol was able to be demon -strated. The use of  vitamin E in skin care has anti-aging benefits based on its moisturization properties but mostly on its protective capabilities. Vitamin E enhances the photoprotectivetoprotective effects of  sunscreen, and when combined with vitamin C, the two are even stronger as photoprotectants [95]. Unfortunately, oral supplementation of  vitamin C and E has proven insufficient in
preventing skin aging owing to their poor solubility, inefficient skin permeability, or instability during storage [136] . Topical vita -min E (α-tocopherol) used as a component of  skin products has anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects in concentrations between 2 and 20%. It acts by smoothing the skin and increasing the ability of  the stratum corneum to maintain its humidity, to accelerate the epithelialization, and contribute to photoprotection of  the skin. The effects are not as strong as with vitamins C and B3 [133] . Most of  the OTC antiaging creams contain 0.5%-1% of  vitamin E.Topical application of  the gel containing 2% phy -tonadione, 0.1% retinol, 0.1% vitamin C, and 0.1% vitamin E has been seen to be fairly or moderately effective in reducing dark under-eye circles, especially in cases of  hemostasis. Topical appli -cation of  vitamin E can rarely cause contact dermatitis, erythema
multiforme, and xanthomatous reaction [134] . The interaction of  vitamins E and C has led to the idea of  “vitamin E recycling”, where the antioxidant function of  oxidized vitamin E is continu -ously restored by other antioxidants (Figure 9). This “antioxidant network” depends upon the supply of  aqueous antioxidants and the metabolic activity of  cells [135] .Vitamin E is a promising chemo-preventive and pharmacologi -cally safe agent, which can be exploited or tested against skin can -cer [137] . Experimental evidence suggests that topical and oral vitamin E has anticarcinogenic, photoprotective, and skin bar -rier-stabilizing properties [138] . The topical use of  resveratol, a polyphenol from red grapes with great antioxidant activity in skin care formulation Farris et al., 2014 reported that significant im -provement in fine lines and wrinkles, skin firmness, skin elasticity, skin laxity, hyperpigmentation, radiance, and skin roughness over

Int J Clin Dermatol Res.  2019;7(4):209-240.225 OPEN ACCESS                                                                                                                                                                               https://scidoc.org/IJCDR.phpaverage improvement of  18.9% in dermal thickness suggesting significant dermal remodeling [139] . Combination of  vitamin E, vitamin C, and ferulic acid can reduce the incidence of  oxidative stress-induced tumors, and their antioxidant effects are much bet -ter than the use of  vitamin C alone [140] . Burns et al., 2013 dem -onstrated that topical 5% alpha tocopherol may actually promote carcinogenesis when applied on chronically UVB-damaged skin while treating with a more stable antioxidant compound may offer therapeutic benefits [141] .Coenzyme Q10:  Coenzyme Q10 (a ubiquinone) is a powerful
free radical inhibitor that inhibits lipid peroxides from forming in plasma membranes. Q10 plays a very important role in cellular en -ergy production and works in the mitochondrial ATP energy-pro -ducing pathway of  the cell. Q10 levels diminish with age, as does cellular energy production,which may improve by adding Q10 [95]. Additionally, UVR, which leads to oxidative damage, signifi -cantly reduces skin's Q10 levels. Approximately 46% of  total Q10 was found to be present in the reduced form in human epidermis. Q10 scavenges ROS and protects cells against oxidative stress. Zhao et al., 2019 concluded that suppression of  the PKA-ERK 1/2 signaling pathway may be one of  the important mechanisms by which Q10 protects astrocytes from UVB-induced oxidative damage [149] . Knott et al., 2015 reported that quinone values on the skin surface were significantly increased after treatment with Q10-containing formulas demonstrating that the powerful
antioxidant Q10 can be delivered directly to the uppermost layer of  the skin [143] . Q10 is an insoluble, poorly permeable antioxi -dant with great biological value which acts as anti-aging and anti-wrinkle agent. Q10 nano-structured lipid carrier (Q10-NLC) had greater antioxidant properties and topical skin penetration than the Q10-emulsion [144] . Also, El-Leithy et al., 2018 reported Q10 nano-emulsionhaving enhanced solubility and permeability with improved anti-wrinkle efficiency [146] . The concentration of  Vi -tamin E and Q10, which together with squalene, play a key role against external oxidative insult, has been shown to decrease sig -nificantly during ageing. Topical application was found to be more effective than oral administration in terms of  sebum levels of  li -pophilic antioxidants and squalene [145] . Also, Žmitek et al., 2017 reported oral supplementation with CoQ10 did not significantly
affect skin hydration and dermis thickness [148] . As an effective fat-soluble antioxidant and an essential element of  the mitochon -drial respiratory chain, Q10 may have healing effects on wound tissues by decreasing oxidative stress and improved mitochondrial efficiency. Choi et al., 2009 reported the anti-inflammatory and wound healing effect of  Q10 in mice [146] . Despite the lack of  evidence, large numbers of  people in the population are taking oral Q10 and other vitamins and cofactors in the hope that these agents will slow senescence and expand longevity [150] .α-Lipoic Acid:  Lipoic acid is a very powerful antioxidant that has the unusual advantage of  being both water and fat soluble and is an important cofactor in mitochondrial dehydrogenases. α-lipoic acid (ALA) is a sulfhydryl compound found naturally in virtually all plant and animal species and in both prokaryotic and eukary -otic cells. In the human body, it is bonded to lysine residues and
acts as a cofactor in various multienzyme complexes. Neverthe -less, there is often little or no free ALA in tissues, so a topical an -
acts as a cofactor in various multienzyme complexes. Neverthe -less, there is often little or no free ALA in tissues, so a topical an -tioxidant formulation containing this natural antioxidant could be used to protect the skin against the effects of  ultraviolet rays, such as photoaging and skin cancer [156] . Studies have shown the ease with which lipoic acid is able to penetrate the skin, after which it converts into its active byproduct dihydrolipoic acid. Topical application of  3% lipoic acid has demonstrated its ability to de -crease UVB-induced erythema, which demonstrates its photopro -tective and anti-inflammatory properties. Also, a 12 -week study demonstrated that using a topical cream containing 5% ALA was quite effective in treating signs of  photoaging [95]. ALA and its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid, are powerful antioxidants that have many physiological functions, including free radical scaveng -
ing of  reactive oxygen species, generation of  cellular antioxidants, chelation of  metal ions, and inflammatory suppression (when given orally) [155] . Though ALA is normally administered in oral or injection, it is rarely used topically because of  its bad penetra -tion. Kubota et al., 2019 developed novel nanocapsule of  ALA, named α-lipoactive (nLA), to improve skin permeability. In in vivo  experiments, it was found that nLA is very effective for improving UV-induced pigmentation and epidermal thickening [151] . Sherif  et al., 2019 demonstrated application of  topical 30% poloxamer gel loaded with ALA cubosomes. Reduction in facial lines, almost complete resolution of  fine lines in the periorbital region and up -per lip area and overall improvement in skin color and texture in most volunteers. There were no instances of  irritation, peeling or other apparent adverse side effects [152] . In a similar study with
5% Cubosomal ALA significantly increased epidermal thickness with effective and safe modality for improving aging face [154] .Lin et al., 2004 were unable to detect protection using ALA alone or together with vitamins C and E. According to them, a commer -cial formulation of  ALA provided no protection [153] . Isaac et al., 2015 reported that rheological features, such as viscosity, thix -Figure 12.

Vitamin C is only one player
in the antioxidant arsenal that includes enzymatic defenses (catalase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) as well as other non-enzymatic defenses (vitamin E, glutathione, uric acid and other putative antioxidants such as carotenoids).

The in vivo cholesterol binding and reduction in the skin thickness by β-glucan were highly encouraging [160] . Although isolated from different sources, including oat, barley, and reishi mushrooms, the most biologically active are isolated from cell membranes of  baker’s yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ). In the epidermis, where mac -
rophage-derived cells include both keratinocytes and Langerhans cells, β-Glucans act to stimulate the protective qualities of  these cells as our first line of  defense. Topical β-Glucans can accelerate wound healing and increase resistance to infection by enhancing macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. Studies have also demon -strated that β-Glucans have photoprotective properties similar to those of  vitamin E by their ability to sustain levels of  reduced glutathione in the skin following UVR. β-Glucans are extremely soothing and calming to the skin through their reinforcement of  skin macrophages,which have implications in minimizing ir -ritancy potential of  products. The potential uses of  β-Glucans in dermatology are numerous. In personal-care products for shaving,where nicks and cuts, razor burn, irritation and follicu -litis are problematic, the protective, wound-healing, anti-irritating effects of  β-Glucans can be quite helpful. The photoprotective
effects of  β-Glucans as well as their ability to soothe, moisturize, and protect the skin from potential irritation that can occur with other treatment products, makes them quite useful in anti-aging skin regimens [95]. Topical application of  β-glucans is increasing, since their pluripotent activity (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and regenerative effects, immunomodulation, radioprotection, moisturization and rejuvenation) might help as a complementary therapy in managing various skin diseases and conditions. Mac -rophages, keratinocytes and fibroblasts are considered the main target cells of  β-glucans during wound healing. β-glucans enhance wound repair by increasing the infiltration of  macrophages, which stimulates tissue granulation, collagen deposition and re-epitheli -alization [157] .A long-term use of  glucan showed reduction of  wrinkle depth, height and overall roughness, which is probably caused by stimu -
lation of  fibroblast and increase production of  collagen. A cell turnover and regenerative extract ofβeta-glucan is believed to support healthy immunosurveillance [158] . Dammarane ginse -nosides are considered to play a major role in the anti wrinkle activities of  ginseng. These compounds are strongly linked with cellulose, pectin, or β-glucan [159] . Jesenak et al., 2016 investi -gated the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activity of  an Imunoglukan P4H® cream, containing β-glucans (pleuran), in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis, where use of  β-glucan-based cream as a supportive complementary therapy [161] . The topical application of  Imunoglukan P4H® showed significant im -provements in both subjective and objective symptoms of  atopic dermatitis and a significant decline in disease severity; exacerba -tion was observed [162] . Sensitive skin is frequently complaint in dermatology consultation with cutaneous manifestations such as

dermatology consultation with cutaneous manifestations such as stinging, redness, dryness, and burning sensation that affect the quality of  life. Its pathogenesis is mainly related to dysfunction of  neurosensory, skin barrier, and also immune activity. Wang et al., 2018 confirmed the effectiveness, tolerance and antisensitive function of  a new complex cream composed by Yunnan Portu -laca oleracea extract, Prinsepiautilis oil, beta-glucan, and sodium hyaluronate extracted from mushroom. The proposed daily care safe moisturizer provided a statistically significant improvement in clinical grading scores for dryness, roughness, and erythema at Figure 13.

Ceramide predominant moisturizers have become a mainstay of  treatment of  skin disease.Ceramides consti -tute (on a weight basis) approximately 47% of  the SC lipids [186] . Moisturizing treatment involves a four-step process: a) repairing the skin barrier, b) increasing water content, c) reducing TEWL and d) restoring the lipid barriers’ ability to attract, hold and re -distribute water. Interestingly, a statistically significant higher cera -
mide/cholesterol ratio was found for men than for women, as reported by Vozella et al., 2019 [183] . Jensen et al., 2005 reported reduced activities of  ceramide-generating epidermal acid sphin -gomyelinase (SMase) and ceramide synthase in the inner epider -mis of  aged skin, explaining its reduced capacity in barrier repair [182] . The effect of  Ceramide cream on enhancing skin barrier function and hydration might be explained by its unique ingredi -ents. Ceramide cream increases skin hydration and improves bar -rier function which may make it suitable for use on dry skin [179] . Several studies have demonstrated that ceramides play an essential role in both the barrier and water-holding functions of  healthy stratum corneum, suggesting that the dysfunction of  the stratum corneum associated with ageing as well that observed in patients with several skin diseases could result from a ceramide deficiency.
A 2-week topical application of  a sonicated Streptococcus thermophi -lus preparation led to significant and relevant increase of  stratum corneum ceramide levels [180] . Draelos et al., 2018 demonstrates that a proprietary combination of  ceramide PC-104, palmitamide MEA, glycerrhetinic acid, and grape seed extract in a glycerin, dimethicone, and petrolatum vehicle was effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of  mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis and other types of  pruritic dermatoses (e.g., senile itch, cosmetic intol -erance syndrome) in children and adults [184] . Yazdanparast et al., 2018 reported skin-identical ceramide complex cream improved contact dermatitis with a decrease in Three-Item Severity (TIS) and an increase in skin hydration, implying a repair of  the skin barrier [185] . Advancements in cosmetic chemistry have resulted in the development of  bio-identical synthetic ceramides that are commonly incorporated into skin care products (notably CER-1,
CER-3, and CER-6), which have been shown to function similar to natural ceramides [186] . Zhang et al., 2015 reported limited penetration of  ceramide species into SC and accumulation on to the skin, suggesting that topical replenishment of  CER may not be an effective approach to improve the barrier properties of  healthy skin [187] .Nicotinamide:  Niacin (vitamin B3) has two potential forms that can be used in cosmeceuticals: niacinamide (nicotinamide) and nicotinic acid [193] . Topical nicotinamide (the active form of  vitamin-B3) has been shown to improve fine lines and wrin -kles, hyperpigmented spots, red blotchiness and sallowness (yel -lowing), as well as elasticity. In addition, nicotinamide has been demonstrated to increase the skin’s production of  collagen and ceramides, and to stimulate keratinocyte differentiation, leading to improved barrier function and skin appearance [95, 105] .Nico-tinamide cream is a more effective moisturizer than white petro -
latum on atopic dry skin, and may be used as a treatment adjunct
to improved barrier function and skin appearance [95, 105] .Nico-tinamide cream is a more effective moisturizer than white petro -latum on atopic dry skin, and may be used as a treatment adjunct in atopic dermatitis [188] . Ashkani et al., 2015 reported its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties, as well as an epithelization inducing action. Nicotinamide also im -proved tissue regeneration through the increment of  fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and vascularization [189] . Nicoti -namide and clindamycin gels were significantly more efficacious in oily and non-oily skin types, respectively. Skin type is a significant factor in choosing between topical nicotinamide and clindamycin in patients with acne vulgaris [196] . Because topical clindamycin, like other antimicrobials, is associated with emergence of  resist -ant microorganisms, nicotinamide 4% gel is a desirable alternative
treatment for acne vulgaris [190] . Niacinamide 4% induces a de -crease in pigmentation, inflammatory infiltrate, and solar elastosis. Niacinamide is a safe and effective therapeutic agent for melasma, compared to 4% hydroquinone. Niacinamide was effective in ap -proximate 40% of  patients, showing outstanding clinical results Figure 14.

In ageing skin, topical application of  niacinamide improves the surface structure, smoothens out wrinkles and inhibits photo-carcinogenesis. It is possible to demonstrate anti-inflammatory effects in acne, rosacea and nitrogen mustard-induced irritation [192] . Nicotinamide also increases the production of  the epider -mal proteins keratin, filaggrin, and involucrin [194] . Nicotinamide increases collagen production in fibroblast cultures and reduces the increased dermal glyco aminoglycosides in photodamaged skin. The glycation between protein and sugar resulting in forma -tion of  cross-linked products gives a yellow color to the skin. As
nicotinamide is a precursor of  antioxidant NADPH, it has anti -glycation effects, thus preventing shallowing of  skin. In a double-blinded, split face, randomized controlled trial, 5% nicotinamide cream was compared to “vehicle only cosmetic” in 30 Japanese women on face for 8 weeks. There was a significant decrease in wrinkles and skin roughness with nicotinamide [195] .Zinc:  The skin is the third most zinc (Zn)-abundant tissue in the body. Zn is a cofactor for over 1000 enzymatic reactions and is necessary for over 2000 transcription factors. Zn-finger pro -teins function for DNA interaction, RNA packaging, activation of  transcription, regulation of  apoptosis, folding and assembly of  protein, and lipid binding. Zn also functions as an intracel -lular signaling molecule, like calcium, by transducing extracellu -lar stimuli into intracellular signaling. Additionally, about 10% of  human proteins binds to Zn. affects 17% of  the world’s popu -
lation who are in the condition of  general malnutrition due to starvation, severe illness, alcohol addiction [211] . The importance of  zinc for humans was acknowledged in the Middle East (Iran, Egypt), in the early 1960s, in patients with growth retardation, hypogonadism, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, dry and wrinkled skin, and severe iron deficiency anemia [212] . A Zn-deficient diet alters the expression of  keratin polypeptides in rats because of  impaired keratinolytic enzyme activity.  Zn is required for the pro -liferation of  keratinocytes and the suppression of  inflammation in Keratinocytes. Zn facilitates the melanocyte proliferation and the autophagy. Zn promotes lipogenesis and glucose transport via its insulin-like effects on 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes [211] . Topical preparations like zinc oxide, calamine, or zinc pyrithione have been in use as photoprotecting, soothing agents or as active
ingredient of  antidandruff  shampoos. Its use has expanded mani -fold over the years for a number of  dermatological conditions including infections (leishmaniasis, warts), inflammatory derma -toses (acne vulgaris, rosacea), pigmentary disorders (melasma), and neoplasias (basal cell carcinoma) [213] .Anti-pollution preparations:  Fernández et al., 2018 demon -strated that SIG-1273 reduced cell death by 66%, outperforming niacinamide, ascorbic acid, and α-tocopherol, commonly used ac -tives in antipollution skin-care products [229] . Addor et al., 2019 reported Cryptomphalus aspersa  secretion with regenerative (hyalu -ronic acid, peptides) and antioxidant ingredients (ectoine, coffee -berry oil, and olive oil), according to the type and area of  the face, on the improvement of  signs of  skin aging.

Narda et al., 2018 reported that daily application of  the facial creamcontaining an EPS, carnosine, and niacinamideover 5 days had a protective effect against pollution-induced changes [231] . Giacomelli et al., 2018 reported that clinical application of  a multicomponent pow -der, including three naturally occurring standardized extracts rich in polyphenols (grape seed extract, green tea extract, oak wood/
bark extract)allows the prevention of  any metal deposition within the SC following exposure in a polluted environment and plays an effective role in counteracting skin damages induced by air pollu -tion [232] .Systemic Anti-aging preparationsCollagen supplementation:  In 2016, the collagen market was valued at an estimated 3.71 billion USD and is projected to reach 6.63 billion USD by 2025. Collagen supplements, originating from various sources (eg, porcine, bovine, marine) and available in nu -merous formulations (eg, protein, gelatin, hydrolysate, peptides), are marketed as improving skin integrity and modulating skin ag -ing. When denatured by heat, collagen forms gelatin, which has been used for centuries as a food source and traditional medicine in Europe and China. Further enzymatic hydrolysis of  gelatin pro -duces collagen hydrolysates (CH) composed of  peptides of  vary -ing lengths, conveniently formulated into liquid drinks and jelly
sticks for oral consumption. In the past decade, CHs have gained popularity as a nutraceutical supplement. Choi et al., 2019 report -ed promising preliminary results for the short and long-term use of  oral collagen supplements for wound healing and skin aging. Oral collagen supplements also increase skin elasticity, hydration, and dermal collagen density.However, even with this increase in patient interest and market share, the use of  collagen supplemen -tation in dermatology remains controversial due to the lack of  regulation on quality and quantity of  ingredients in OTC collagen supplements [164, 171]  Maria et al., 2019 reported improvement of  general skin conditions, acting in different mechanisms by oral supplementation and topical application of  hydrolyzed proteins [165] . Proksch et al., 2014 reported significant improvement in after 8 weeks of  supplementation in women aged 35-55 years but
study failed to reach a level of  statistical significance with regard to skin moisture and skin evaporation [166] . Oral administration of  Low-molecular-weight Collagen peptide (LMWCP), which is a fish-derived collagen hydrolysate, promotes recovery of  collagen fibers and normal elastic fibers in the skin from degraded col -lagen and abnormal elastic fibers caused by UVB irradiation in hairless mice [167] . Kim et al., 2018 reported that LMWCP is a safe health functional food ingredient with anti-skin photoaging efficacy which can effectively improve hydration, elasticity, and wrinkling in human skin at the dose of  1000 mg once daily [168] .Oral supplementation with collagen bioactive peptides (hydro -lyzed fish collagen) combined with chondroitin sulphate, glucosa -mine, L-carnitine, vitamins, and minerals significantly improved the clinical parameters related to skin aging and joint health [169] .

Lee et al., 2019 reported that orally administering collagen peptide NS (CPNS) to rats, the plasma concentrations of  Gly-Pro and Pro-Hyp increased dramatically. The CPNS consumption signifi -cantly attenuated UVB-induced wrinkle formation, transepider -mal water loss, and epidermis thickness, and increased skin hydra -tion [170] . An association between oral administration of  collagen peptides combined with vitamin C and extracts of  Hibiscus sab -dariffa  and Aristotelia chilensis  was observed by Addor et al., 2018. Female adult patients received an oral nutritional supplement from a sachet and were instructed to consume 1 sachet diluted in 200 mL of  water once daily for 12 weeks. Clinical evaluation by high frequency ultrasound and cutometry showed significant improvement of  firmness and elasticity and an increase in dermal thickness by ultrasound after 3 months of  use [171] . Zague et al., 2018 reported that collagen peptides modulate the metabolism
of  extracellular matrix proteins by human dermal fibroblasts (in culture) that were derived from sun-protected and sun-exposed body sites [172] . Song et al., 2017 examined the effects of  col -lagen hydrolysates from sliver carp skin on UV-induced photo-aging in mice and found that LMW peptides exerted beneficial effects when compared to high molecular weight CHs on HA levels and moisture content of  the skin [173] .Probiotics: Lactic acid  bacteria consist of  26 genera now, and play an essential role in the food industry in the manufacture of  many Figure 15.

Application of  these organisms is now being extended to the area of  health improvement, as their probiotic activities become known. Lactococcus lactis  H61 improved skin status in Japanese women with oral intake of  heat-killed or live cells. With regard to live cells in fermented milk made by strain H61, the reported effects are attractive and it is expected that consumption of  H61-fermented milk will increase [175] . It is also reported that oral intake of  Lactobacillus rhamnosus  SP1 improves the appearance of  adult acne [176] . Oral intake of  yoghurt made by using Lactobacil-
lus delbrueckii  subsp. bulgaricus 2038 plus Streptococcus thermophilus  1131 for 4 weeks improved skin elasticity and the degree of  dry -ness in cheeks of  women [177] . Mori et al., 2016 also reported that the intake of  fermented milk containing Bifidobacterium  breve strain Yakult plus galactooligosaccharides for 4 weeks increased hydration levels of  the stratum corneum in women [178] .Astaxanthin: Astaxanthin is ubiquitous in nature, especially found in the marine environment as a red-orange pigment com -mon to many aquatic animals such as salmonids, shrimp, and crayfish. The ROS lead to skin aging via oxidative damage that are induced by UVR. Therefore, topical formulations which have antioxidant effect could reduce aging level [199] . Eren et al., 2019 reported that topical formulations of  astaxanthin-loaded algae ex -tractcould be suggested as topical anti-aging formulations [197] . Comparative studies examining the photoprotective effects of
carotenoids have demonstrated that astaxanthin is a superior an -tioxidant, having greater antioxidant capacity than canthaxanthin and β-carotene in human dermal fibroblasts [199] . In particular, astaxanthininhibits ROS formation and modulates the expression of  oxidative stress-responsive enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which is a marker of  oxidative stress and a regulatory mechanism involved in the cell adaptation against oxidative dam -age [203] .Astaxanthin exerts significant antioxidant activities not only via direct radical scavenging, but also by activating the cellular anti -oxidant defense system through modulation of  the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) pathway. Fang et al., 2017 dem -onstrated that astaxanthin protected against early burn-wound progression by attenuating ROS-induced oxidative stress in a rat deep-burn model [198] . In vitro , astaxanthin effectively suppresses
cell damage caused by free radicals and induction of  MMP-1 in skin after UV irradiation [200] . Chou et al., 2016 reported that an enriched astaxanthin extract from H. pluvialis increased collagen content through inhibition of  MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression in human dermal fibroblasts [201] . Meephansan et al., 2017 reported that astaxanthin-treated wounds in mice showed significantly in -creased expression of  wound healing biological markers such as collagen type I α 1 (Col1A1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [202] . The immunomodulatory action of  astaxanthin has been also reported in dogs and cats, enhancing both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. In these studies, astaxanthin in -creased natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxic activity, suggesting that astaxanthin may regulate NK cells that serve as an immunosur -veillance system against tumors and virus-infected cells [203, 204] . Astaxanthin is reported to improve the DNA repair capacity of

Astaxanthin is reported to improve the DNA repair capacity of  cells exposed to UV radiation. In particular, astaxanthin was ca -pable of  minimizing DNA damage and influencing the kinetics of  DNA repair [208] . Human cells possess multiple protection mechanisms against UV-induced ROS, either by preventing dam -age or by damage repair. Camera et al., 2009 reported thatastax -anthin inhibits the UV-induced DNA damage and increases the expression of  oxidative stress-responsive enzymes [203] . Tomina -ga et al., 2017 suggested that long-term prophylactic astaxanthin supplementation may inhibit age-related skin deterioration and maintain skin conditions associated with environmentally induced damage via its anti-inflammatory effect [207] .Colostrum:  Colostrum is the initial milk or “first milk” that is produced by mammals (including humans) immediately follow -
ing parturition. As expected, colostrum was more effective than Exhibit 10.

In addition, with further analysis, the fat globule frac -tion provided the strongest stimulation for wound repair that contained Epidermal Growth Factors. The milk fluid produced by all female mammalian species after birth has the function to meet the complete nutritional requirements of  the neonate and, at the same time, provide all of  the biochemical needs and sup -port the many biological functions of  the immature newborn to help the newborn survive and develop. Starting in the 1980s and
through the mid-1990s, supplemented cell culture medium with milk or colostrum was reported to improve the growth rate of  many cell types including skin (fibroblasts). Peptides from milk protein hydrolysates improved the growth of  human keratino -cytes in culture. Medium supplemented with 300 μg/mL for 12 days where the average molecular weight of  800 Da containing a high concentration of  amino acids promoted the growth of  the keratinocytes by 108% [174] . Colostrum is the only known natural source of  the enzyme, telomerase, which may help to slow down the aging of  DNA.In fact, there is evidence that short telomeres and a lack of  telomerase can exert a longevity-promoting effect via prevention of  cancer [209] . Colostrum also includes EGF and IGF-1, which are known to assist in the repair and regeneration of  cells. EGF and IGF-1 play essential roles in wound healing, which makes colostrum an important potential adjunct to the
skin’s repair following a surgical cosmetic procedure. Let’s not forget about the lactoferrin in colostrum, either. Lactoferrin helps manage the immune response in the skin cells, which means sup -plementing with lactoferrin may potentially help a person increase his or her skin’s anti-inflammatory response [210] .Selenium:  Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element in the hu -man body and plays an important role in the body via selenopro -tein, which contains selenium. Selenoproteins (glutathione peroxi -dase, thioredoxin reductase, methionine sulfoxide reductase-1 and endoplasmic reticulum-selenoproteins, etc.) have antioxidant ef -fects and are involved in regulating antioxidant activities [214] . Se and the selenoproteins are essential for keratinocyte function and Figure 16.

A lack of  selenoenzymes in the mouse epider -mis leads to abnormalities in the skin and hair follicles, premature skin aging, and premature death. Additionally, several studies have shown that Se pretreatment can drastically protect keratinocytes, melanocytes, and fibroblasts from UV-induced cytotoxicity.  Low doses of  Se were very potently protective against UVA-induced cytotoxicity in young keratinocytes, whereas the aged keratino -cytes require four times more Se than the young keratinocytes to be protected from UVA-induced cytotoxicity [215, 216] . Se pro -tects keratinocyte stem cells (KSCs) against senescence via preser -
vation of  their stemness phenotype through adhesion to the base -ment membrane [216] . Wang et al., 2017 showed that Vitamin C (250 mg/kg), vitamin E (250 mg/kg) and Se (0.2 mg/kg) exerted antioxidant effects and consequently may prevent skin damage caused by streptozotocin-induced diabetes (65 mg/kg) in Swiss albino rats [217] .Hyaluronic Acid:  Hyaluronic acid (HA) is part of  the body's connective tissues, and is known to cushion and lubricate. Aging destroys HA. Diet and smoking can also affect your body's level of  HAover time.  Skin care products with HA are most frequently used to treat wrinkled skin although they don't replace anything the body has naturally lost. These are very effective moisturiz -ers [219] . UV radiation damage causes initially a mild form of  wound healing and is associated at first with an increase of  dermal HA. As little as 5 min of  UV exposure in nude mice caused en -hanced deposition of  HA, indicating that UV radiation induced
skin damage is an extremely rapid event. The initial redness of  the skin following exposure to UV radiation may be due to a mild edematous reaction induced by the enhanced HA deposition and histamine release. Repeated and extensive exposures to UV ulti -mately simulate a typical wound healing response with deposition of  scarlike type I collagen, rather than the usual types I and III collagen mixture that gives skin resilience and pliability [120] . HA based formulations (i.e., gels, creams, intra-dermal filler injections, dermal fillers, facial fillers, autologous fat gels, lotion, serum, and implants, etc.) exhibit remarkable anti-wrinkle, anti-nasolabial fold, anti-aging, space-filling, and face rejuvenating properties. This has been achieved via soft tissue augmentation, improved skin hydration, collagen and elastin stimulation, and face volume restoration. HA, alone or in combination with lidocaine and other
co-agents, showed promising efficacy in skin tightness and elas -ticity, face rejuvenation, improving aesthetic scores, reducing the wrinkle scars, longevity, and tear trough rejuvenation [125] . Spara -vigna et al., 2019 reported significant improvement of  wrinkles' grade around the eyes, vertical lip lines and wrinkles' severity of  nasolabial folds after the first injection and the effect increased after the second injection. Aging/photoaging grade and surface microrelief  improved 2 months after the first injection proce -dure.The treatments were very well tolerated by the volunteers as determined by the self-grading score [121] . Lee et al., 2019 re -ported that Cross-linked hyaluronic acid (CLHA) patches were not an irritant, whereas a clinical study showed that application of  single CLHA patches significantly improved skin hydration at the periorbital region for 3 days and at the nasolabial fold for 6
days. Patch application also improved superficial wrinkles at the periorbital region for 3 days and at the nasolabial fold for 1 day.
days. Patch application also improved superficial wrinkles at the periorbital region for 3 days and at the nasolabial fold for 1 day. The absence of  side effects indicated that application of  these CLHA microstructure patches is both safe and convenient for moisturization and anti-wrinkle effects [122] . Jeon et al., 2019 re -ported that CTP-EGF has a superior ability, compared with natu -ral EGF, to permeate skin and induce HA synthesis and collagen formation. Thus, it has great potential to be used in cosmetics and therapeutic agents to improve wrinkles and health of  the skin [123] . There exist many different types of  HA gel fillers that dif -fer in their HA concentration, particle size, cross-linking density, duration, and presence of  lidocaine. High-density, large-particle fillers are recommended for deep dermal injections while the low-density, small-particle fillers are recommended for fine lines.HA
gel is used by several healthcare professionals include the plastic surgeon, primary care provider, dermatologist, nurse practitioner and the internist to enhance cosmesis. HA fillers are injected to restore volume lost due to age or disease, provide facial contour, and help maintain a youthful appearance. Filler injection has be -come one of  the most commonly performed procedures in a der -matology cosmetic practice [124] .Poly-L-lactic acid:  Poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) is an injectable filler used for restoring facial fat volume loss. Polydioxanone Cog thread and poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) thread have been used clinically for lifting and antiaging purposes [218] . PLLA is an ef -fective treatment for patients seeking to correct volume loss due to aging. Although the US FDA has approved PLLA for use in people with the HIV in 2004, it is well-suited for patients seek -ing cosmetic treatment.By 2009 PLLA was FDA-approved for the
correction of  nasolabial fold contour deficiencies and other lines and wrinkles. There have since been limited but promising results with off-label use of  PLLA for non-facial volumization as well, including the hands, neck/décolleté, abdomen, and gluteal area [219] . PLLA is a safe, biodegradable volumizer used to reverse the signs of  aging by gradually correcting volume loss. Patients should be aware of  possible adverse reactions during the course of  treatment [218] . Injection of  PLLA in the deep dermis or sub -cutaneous tissue may cause an immediate augmentation of  the treated tissue. This is a temporary but immediate response that is due to tissue edema and fluid from the reconstitution of  the product. It will resolve within 2 to 3 days after injection. Once the carrier substance is absorbed, the poly-L-lactic acid particles induce an inflammatory response through phagocytosis by tis -sue macrophages. This is a similar process to suture reabsorption
in the skin. The inflammatory response breaks down the poly-L-lactic acid into lactic acid monomers and is then metabolized to carbon dioxide and water while stimulating the production of  new collagen type-I fibers in the skin. Approximately half  of  the product is digested within 6 months. The duration of  action is 12 to 24 months [220] . Kapicioğlu et al., 2019 reported that PLLA and Cog sutures were effective in facial rejuvenation (studied in female rats); both increased dermis thickness and stimulated col -lagen production [110] . Repeated PLLA treatments may improve skin quality in a time-dependent manner. Pigmentation, erythema, and pore size were significantly decreased, whereas radiance and smoothness were significantly increased at 12 months. No treat -ment-related adverse events occurred. Repeated PLLA treatments may improve skin quality in a time-dependent manner [111] . The process of  hydration, loss of  cohesion and molecular weight, and
solubilization and phagocytosis of  PLA by the host’s macrophag -es, degrades PLA into lactic acid microspheres and eliminates
process of  hydration, loss of  cohesion and molecular weight, and solubilization and phagocytosis of  PLA by the host’s macrophag -es, degrades PLA into lactic acid microspheres and eliminates CO2 by way of  respiratory excretion. Crystals are left behind to stimulate collagen and a granulomatous reaction. This inflamma -tory reaction elicits resorption and the formation of  fibrous con -nective tissue about the foreign body, causing dermal fibroplasia that leads to the desired cosmetic effect [2]. Kim et al., 2019 re -ported that powdered polydioxanone injection induces collagen formation more effectively than PLLA injection [220] .

Int J Clin Dermatol Res.  2019;7(4):209-240.233 OPEN ACCESS                                                                                                                                                                               https://scidoc.org/IJCDR.phpHormone Replacement Therapy:  In postmenopausal women, dermal collagen decreases, and skin becomes thinner [238] . Hor -mone replacement therapy (HRT) has been shown to be effective in alleviating menopausal symptoms. However, its use is contro -versial owing to potential health risks, such as thromboembolism and cancer. Bioidentical hormone therapy has also been used by dermatologists for its anti-aging effects on the skin, but little is known about efficacy and side effects of  bioidentical hormones in this field [233] . Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study showed a higher risk for breast cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and
thromboembolic events with combined treatment of  estrogens and progestin. Synthetic progestins mostly used worldwide in -clude medroxyprogesterone acetate (most frequently used in the US), norethidrone acetate, cyproteron acetate, norgestimate, norgestrel, and dydrogesterone [235] . The HRT impact on skin thickness and dermal density was demonstrated early when estro -gens were initially administered to postmenopausal women. Such replenishment therapy was therefore considered as an attempt at alleviating in part skin atrophy and xerosis in postmenopausal women. Indeed, HRT controls in part the dermal thickness and laxity, and the collagen content and density, as well as the tissue mechanical reactivity to stress [234] . Physicians and patients have become extremely reluctant concerning HRT following the WHI study. Numbers of  HRT prescriptions in the US rose from 58 million in 1995 to 90 million in 1999, corresponding to 15 mil -
lion women per year. Numbers remained stable through to 2002. Within 3 months after publication of  the results of  the WHI study, prescriptions of  various formulations of  combined estrogens and progesterone dropped by 33% to 66% [235] . Vinogradova et al., 2019 reported association between risk of  venous thromboembo -lism and different types of  HRT. Transdermal treatment was the safest type of  hormone replacement therapy when risk of  venous thromboembolism was assessed. Transdermal treatment appears to be underused, with the overwhelming preference still for oral preparations [236] . Both oral and transdermal estradiol caused a significant decrease in FSH while only transdermal resulted in a significant decrease in LH. Oral estradiol, though not transder -mal estradiol, increased serum high density lipoprotein, thyroxine binding protein and growth hormone binding protein [237] . Ap-plying estrogen cream to the skin after menopause improves the
external appearance of  facial skin [238] . There is strong evidence that transdermal estradiol has a cardioprotective effect [240] . Due to their lack of  first-pass hepatic metabolism, transdermal prod -ucts achieve clinical benefits while minimizing patient exposure to estrogens, which is consistent with the most recent clinical guidelines [241] . Also, by increasing skin collagen content, and increasing acid mucopolysaccharides and HA, estrogen therapy encourages the growth and development of  vaginal epithelial cells which make up the thick layers of  the vaginal wall, and con -done a moist, supple and elastic environment [239] . Botelho et al., 2014 reported that nanostructured formulationof  progesterone (10%) combined with estriol (0.1%) + estradiol (0.25%) is safe and effective in re-establishing optimal serum levels of  estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone and relieving the symptoms of  menopause [240] . Abdi et al., 2017 also concluded that use of
transdermal nano-formulations in hormone therapy can relieve
and follicle-stimulating hormone and relieving the symptoms of  menopause [240] . Abdi et al., 2017 also concluded that use of  transdermal nano-formulations in hormone therapy can relieve climacteric symptoms and prevent other postmenopausal symp -toms [242] .EpilogueAs more and more anti-ageing and antioxidant skin care prod -ucts flood the market, there is growing   concern about defini -tions and experimental proof  of    effectiveness. The physician has an important role in understanding which treatment options are appropriate for mild, moderate, and severe photoaging, and in educating patients on the risks and benefits of  each.The choice of  the right active compounds, the   verification of  their activity inside a cosmetic formulation, their   stability and synergistic ef -fects should be the first step toward   the creation of  modern and effective products.  To be active   inside the skin, the antioxidants
have to penetrate into the living layers of  the skin, where free radi -cals are generated and   should be effective against   ROS.  This is possible only if  the   topical applied formulation holds the poten -tial to be effective.Moisturizing and emollient products are gain -ing increasing importance in dry skin treatment, maintenance of  daily care of  normal skin as well as ancillary therapy of  many skin diseases.Consumers are nowadays more focused on their health and appearance. As a result, there has been an increasing demand in topical antiaging formulations with natural and nutraceutical ingredients. Novel and innovative delivery systems are transform -ing the new product development in the cosmetic field because of  consumer perceivable benefits and optimized sensory attributes. The applications of  novel drug delivery systems can be found in many cosmetic products. Nanomaterials are nowadays used in almost all the major cosmetic industries. The truth is, there
is no magic pill at present that will retard aging. But that is not to say there are not simple lifestyle and dietary adjustments that can make people live longer. A cosmetic product that produces clinically objective effects on the most-reported signs of  aging is an attractive option for those unable to avoid extrinsic aging fac -tors but wishing to improve their appearance without resorting to more invasive measures.Article SummarySkin care products with antioxidative and anti-aging claims are one of  the most fast-growing market for cosmetics worldwide. Anti-aging in dermatology primarily focuses on the prevention of  skin aging with UV protection (clothing and sunscreens), free radical scavengers (synthetic or botanic), and cell-protecting agents. Many synthetic and natural products have been reported to enhance levels of  antioxidant enzymes, which make them ther -apeutic candidates to mitigate UV-mediated damage and to pre -
vent the health consequences of  UV exposure. Topical hormonal prescriptions are also an option if  UV damage has not been the leading culprit for aging. Chemical peeling leads to a marked in -crease in collagen formation, the deeper the better. Ingredients in cream preparations can reduce superficial skin folds (polyphe -nols, amino acid peptides). Modulators of  regular pigmentation are important for anti-aging preparations. New approaches are being designed to exploit the signaling pathways to delay or even prevent free-radical induced symptoms of  aging. There are too many products on the market, from so many brands, with more and more ingredients, and at various price points. Selecting the right anti-aging product is definitely a daunting task, but this guide is meant to simplify the process and help to choose the right anti-aging skin care products for an individual skin.

Skin aging is a complex biological process influenced by combi -nation of  endogenous or intrinsic (genetics, cellular metabolism, hormone and metabolic processes) andexogenous or extrinsic (chronic light exposure, pollution, ionizing radiation, chemicals, toxins) factors.2. Skin aging is characterized by features such as wrinkling, loss of  elasticity, laxity, and rough-textured appearance.3. Anti-aging medicine encompasses lifestyle changes, hormone replacement therapies, as needed, determined by a physician through blood testing; antioxidants and vitamin supplements; and
testing protocols that can measure not only hormone levels and blood chemistry but every metabolic factor right down to the cel -lular level.4. Cell senescence limits cell divisions in normal somatic cells and may play a central role in age-related diseases.5. The major perceived risk factors are unhealthy eating habits, stress, less exercise, dehydration, diseased state and sleeping hab -its, though the main factor responsible for extrinsic aging is UVR.6. Exposure to UVR is the primary factor of  extrinsic skin aging, it accounts for about 80% of  facial aging.7. IR radiation and heat can lead to macrophage recruitment like UVR.8. Even in indoor conditions, particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure levels were positively associated with skin aging manifestation.9. Smoking provokes elastosis, telangiectasia, skin roughness, and premature wrinkles on facial skin due to the vascular constriction of  nicotine.
of  nicotine.10. Sleep deprivation is associated with increased signs of  intrin -sic skin aging (fine lines, uneven pigmentation, reduced elasticity), with much slower recovery rates.11. Cooking processes that lead to higher levels of  advanced gly -cation end product (AGEs) include grilling, frying, and roasting.12. Among US population 75% consumed less fruit and 87% consumed fewer vegetables than recommended.13. Higher intakes of  vitamin C and linoleic acid and lower in -takes of  fats and carbohydrates are associated with better skin-aging appearance.14. In order to lowering the skin damage, cleansings with neutral pH and pH close to 5.5 are recommended.15. 30-70% of  patients with DM, both type 1 and type 2, will pre -sent with a cutaneous complication of  DM at some point during their lifetime.16. Obese-diabetes patients have decreased stratum corneum hy -dration, increased trans-epidermal water loss, higher skin AGEs
and decreased dermal collagen fiber density compared with nor -mal-weight subjects.17. Type I and III skin collagen is thought to decrease by as much as 30% in the first five years after menopause.18. Africans from the African continent show delayed signs of  aging compared to Caucasians. Darker skin types are better pro -tected regarding sun exposure due to the higher melanin content in their skin.19. The skin parameters of  hydration, trans-epidermal water loss, sebum, microcirculation, pigmentation, and thickness are gener -ally higher in men but skin pH is higher in women.20. There is no proven effective product that completely elimi -nates the symptoms of  skin photoaging, but there are products and treatments that can visibly reduce or slow down these symp -toms.References[1].
