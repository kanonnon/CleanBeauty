We address, for the ﬁrst time, the impact of skin insertion on multiple occasions of polymeric micronee-dle arrays in an animal model in vivo . Dissolving microneedle arrays prepared from aqueous blends of20% w/w Gantrez/C210S-97 BF and 40% w/w poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) 58 kDa and hydrogel-forming micronee-dle arrays prepared from aqueous blends of and poly(ethyleneglycol) 10 kDa were repeatedly applied tothe skin of hairless mice in vivo . Skin appearance and skin barrier function, as illustrated by measurementof transepidermal water loss, were not measurably altered during the entire study period. Biomarkers ofinfection, immunity and inﬂammation/irritation were also statistically unchanged, regardless of themicroneedle formulation, needle density or number of applications. Mice remained healthy throughoutand continued to gain weight during the study. For example, transepidermal water loss values were typ-ically in the range 10–15 g m
ically in the range 10–15 g m/C02h/C01immediately prior to microneedle insertion and 15–25 g m/C02h/C01immediately following microneedle removal, regardless of when they were measured during the studyperiods. Serum biomarker levels, measured immediately post-mortem were always in the range 10–20mgm l/C01for C-reactive protein, 0.5–1.5 mg ml/C01for Immunoglobulin G and 1000–2500 pg ml/C01forinterleukin 1- band were never statistically different from untreated controls. No measurable levels oftumour necrosis factor- awere found in any animals. These ﬁndings are encouraging for the formulationsinvestigated, suggesting that their repeated use by patients will not cause undesirable side-effects. Bybeginning to address potential regulatory questions at an early stage, the microneedles ﬁeld will beideally-placed to take advantage of the potential market. This work illustrates a potential pre-clinicalstrategy for development of regulatory dossiers on microneedle technologies.

IntroductionMicroneedle arrays (MN), minimally-invasive devices that pain-lessly and without drawing blood penetrate the skin’s stratum cor-neum barrier to greatly expand the range of substances that can bedelivered into and across the skin have shown tremendous pro-mise over recent years. However, no true MN array-based productis currently marketed. Indeed, bringing a new drug or a new dosageform to market is a costly and time-consuming process. Increasingregional and international regulation, while necessary, has onlyserved to augment costs [1]. Guidance and regulations establishedby the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has played a criticalrole in providing a framework for many regulatory bodies world-wide [2,3] . During the development of a new drug or medical
device, an assessment of potential biological risks must be per-formed. While the possible regulatory questions pertaining to var-ious MN designs have been speculated upon in the literature [4–7] ,
device, an assessment of potential biological risks must be per-formed. While the possible regulatory questions pertaining to var-ious MN designs have been speculated upon in the literature [4–7] ,only a few relevant experimental studies have been published.Such investigations, using a mixture of animal models and humanvolunteers, recorded changes in skin barrier function throughtransepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements [8,9] , local skinirritation and subcutaneous blood ﬂow [8–11] , dimensions of theinduced skin pores [12–14] , histological changes and inﬂammatorycell inﬁltrations [12,15] .http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpb.2017.04.0290939-6411/ /C2112017 The Author.

Safety studies performed to date have assumed that MN willalways be used for their most commonly suggested application;as vaccine delivery devices. Accordingly, measurements weretaken after a single MN array insertion. However, our own workhas shown that appropriately-designed MN patches are capableof delivering therapeutically relevant doses of drugs transdermally,even when such drugs are not of high potency [16,17] . We havealso illustrated that MN may have a role to play in minimally-invasive patient monitoring [18,19] . In both of these latter applica-tions, MN will certainly be inserted into the skin on a regular basis,with daily use not out of the question. Indeed, even MN vaccinesare likely to be inserted more than once, given the need for primeand boost regimes to attain strong immunisation for most currentvaccines.It is our considered view that dissolving polymeric MN arrayswill ﬁnd their most appropriate use as vaccine delivery vehicles,
due to their ordinarily-limited loading capacity and their tendencyto deposit polymer in skin. As such they will be inserted in skin arelatively small number of times over a patient’s lifetime. In con-trast, our hydrogel-forming MN, which swell in skin to allow con-trolled delivery of a drug substance from an attached patch-typedrug reservoir, or capture skin interstitial ﬂuid for use in patientmonitoring, are removed intact from skin, depositing no measur-able amount of polymer [16–19] . Since patients may need a drugadministered on a daily basis or routine monitoring for a chroniccondition, these MN are likely to be inserted into skin on a muchmore regular basis. Since regulators will undoubtedly ask ques-tions about the impact of repeated MN insertion, we designed aseries of pre-clinical experiments to investigate this, the resultsof which are detailed here.2. Materials and methods2.1. ChemicalsGantrez/C210S-97 BF, a copolymer of methyl-vinyl ether-co-maleic-
acid (PMVE/MA), M w= 1,500,000 Da) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)(PVP, M w= 58,000 Da) were provided by Ashland, Surrey, UK. Poly-ethylene glycol (PEG, M w= 10,000 Da) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany. Isoﬂurane was acquired from AbbottLaboratories, Illinois, USA. Formaldehyde-saline was purchasedfrom TCS Biosciences Ltd, Buckingham, UK. All other chemicalsused were of analytical reagent grade.2.2. AnimalsCrl: SKH1-Hrhrmice were chosen as the test animals becausethey have been previously used as a dermatological animal modeldue to their lack of hair [20]. This characteristic avoided the contin-uous hair removal procedure prior to MN insertion that couldpotentially irritate skin. Importantly, unlike other strains of hair-less mice, Crl: SKH1-Hrhrare immunocompetent [21].All animal experiments throughout this study were approvedby the Ethics Committee of the QUB Biological Services Unit andconducted according to the policy of the Federation of European
Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA) and The Euro-pean Convention for the protection of Vertebrate Animals usedfor Experimental and Other Scientiﬁc Purposes, with implementa-tion of the principle of the 3Rs (replacement, reduction, reﬁne-ment). Any animals with 20% weight loss during the study wereto be removed for euthanasia, but this did not occur. No skin reac-tions to MN occurred either. At the end of the experiment, eutha-nasia was by carbon dioxide.2.3. Biomarker assaysFour biomarkers were measured in mice sera at the end of theexperiment. The biomarkers chosen were: C-reactive protein(CRP), interleukin 1- b(IL-1 b), tumour necrosis factor- a(TNF- a)and immunoglobulin G (Ig G). CRP levels rapidly increase withinhours after tissue injury or infection, suggesting that it contributesto host defence and that it is part of the innate immune response[22]. CRP is a biomarker typically used to diagnose infection and
sepsis [23,24] . CRP serum content was quantiﬁed to conﬁrm that
to host defence and that it is part of the innate immune response[22]. CRP is a biomarker typically used to diagnose infection andsepsis [23,24] . CRP serum content was quantiﬁed to conﬁrm thatrepeated MN skin insertion does not promote skin or systemicinfection. TNF- ais considered the principal mediator of eventsinvolved in inﬂammation and immunity, playing a preponderantrole in defence against infections by fungi, bacteria and even para-sites [25]. TNF- aalso seems to be a key regulator of local T-cellproliferation and subsequent development in autoimmune disor-ders of the skin [26]. IL-1 bis one of the key members of the IL-1-like family of cytokines. This family consists of 11 proteins thatregulate inﬂammation caused by bacterial or viral infections or inresponse to molecular patterns associated with danger and dam-age. The main producers of IL-1 bare cells of the innate immunesystem; monocytes and macrophages. Other cell types, however,
such as epithelial cells, astrocytes, and ﬁbroblasts, present in theskin are also able to express IL-1 b[27,28] . Levels of IL-1 bhave beenconnected with inﬂammatory processes in cancer and skin psoria-sis[29,30] . Ig G is principally responsible for the recognition, neu-tralization; and elimination of pathogens and toxic antigens [31].Ig G is produced in a delayed response to an infection and can beretained in the body for prolonged periods of time.Mouse DuoSet ELISA quantiﬁcation kits for IL-1 b, CRP and TNF-awere purchased from R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, USA.Mouse IgG Total ELISA Ready-SET-Go! was acquired from Affyme-trix, California, USA. In all cases, appropriate dilutions of sampleswere made so as to align with the relevant calibration ranges.2.4. MicroneedlesLaser-engineered silicone micromoulds were manufacturedusing a previously detailed method [32]. The features of the nee-dles produced were conical shapes with: 600 lm heights,
300lm base widths and 150 lm needle interspacing on a0.5 cm2area (19 /C219 design) and 600 lm heights, 300 lm basewidths and 300 lm needle interspacing a 0.5 cm2area (11 /C211design).As shown in Fig. 1 , hydrogel-forming MN were prepared fromaqueous blends of 15% w/w PMVE/MA and 7.5% w/w PEG as previ-ously described [16–19] . Dissolving MN were prepared from aque-ous blends of 20% w/w PMVE/MA and 40% w/w of PVP,respectively. In each case, formulations were ﬁrst centrifuged at3500 rpm for 15 min to ensure a homogenous blend and to removeany air bubbles. An aliquot of 0.5 g was then cast into the siliconemicromould and centrifuged again at 3500 rpm for a further15 min. Following air drying, hydrogel-forming MN were cross-linked by esteriﬁcation. In all cases, the sidewalls formed duringmicromoulding were removed using a heated scalpel prior to use.2.5. In vivo multiple application of polymeric microneedle arraysA total number of 36 healthy hairless mice, 18 males and 18
females, were used. Animals were housed according to gender,polymer, and needle density. There were 12 groups, with threemice in each group. Two control groups of mice had no MNinserted into their skin at any time, while the remaining groupshad one of the two densities of either dissolving of hydrogel-forming MN arrays inserted into their skin repeatedly. Mice alwayshad the same type of MN inserted and there was no interchangingE.M. Vicente-Perez et al. / European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 117 (2017) 400–407 401
once a mouse was assigned to a particular group. MN were alwaysapplied at the same approximate sites on each mouse. Treated MNmice were compared with negative control groups (only surgicaltape applied) to verify if any signiﬁcant changes were observedin the skin or serum biomarkers.Dissolving MN arrays were inserted once per week for ﬁve con-secutive weeks in each hairless mouse. In each case, two MN arrayswere inserted into two opposite positions in skin of the lower back(Fig. 2 ). MN arrays were inserted by pinching the skin applicationsite for 30 s with the thumb and foreﬁnger. After MN insertion,arrays were kept in place for 24 h using surgical tape (MicroporeTM,3M, Bracknell, UK). The application protocol for hydrogel-formingMN arrays was the same. However, the frequency of insertionwas increased to twice per week during three successive weeks.The insertion/application protocols are summarised in Fig. 3 .Mouse well-being was monitored by recording weight once per
week during the performance of the study. Skin appearance wastracked over time viadigital pictures (Nikon CoolpixTM, Nikon,Tokyo, Japan) taken under controlled lighting conditions.

and after removal in each case, so as to track any possible skinchanges.Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements were takenas a measure of skin barrier function state (VapoMeter/C210, DelﬁnTechnologies Ltd, Kuopio, Finland). Measurements were takendirectly from the two application sites immediately before eachMN insertion and again immediately following each MN removal.2.6. Sacriﬁce, blood collection and biomarker quantiﬁcationMice were euthanised immediately after the last MN array wasremoved. Subsequently, blood was collected viacardiac puncture.To gather serum samples for the ELISAs used to quantify thebiomarkers, Eppendorf tubes were incubated at 37 /C176C for 45 min.Afterwards, tubes were centrifuged at 4 /C176C at 200 rpm for 15 min.Supernatant was carefully collected and aliquoted to be stored at/C080/C176C prior to assay by ELISA, following the manufacturers’instructions and measuring absorbances using an Enspire/C210plater-
eader (Perkin-Elmer, London, UK) at the appropriate wavelengths.2.7. Statistical analysisData was analysed, as appropriate, using the Mann-Whitneytest, Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunns post-test to compare controlgroup and MN-treated groups. In all cases, p< 0.05 was consideredas a signiﬁcant difference.3. Results3.1. Fabrication of polymeric microneedle arrays and in vivoapplication and removalA total number of 384 MN arrays were produced using the threeformulations and two needle densities. As shown in Fig. 4 A and B,MN arrays had, in each case, fully-formed needles with sharp tips.As a normal behaviour, mice were inclined to eat the surgical tapearound the abdominal area. However, MN patches were still keptin place and always remained inserted until removal after 24 h,as shown in Fig. 5 C and D.A total of 120 dissolving MN arrays were inserted into mouseskin in vivo over a 5-week period. Upon removal after 24 hours’
insertion, the needles had universally dissolved in skin, leavingonly a gel-like baseplate ( Fig. 5 A and B).

week period. All needles remained fully intact when recoveredafter 24 hours’ insertion. The hydrogel-forming MN arrays hadswollen in skin and were now ﬂexible in nature ( Fig. 5 C and D).3.2. In vivo transdermal water loss measurements, monitoring of skinappearance and mouse wellbeingAnimal welfare was assessed through the observation of animalbehaviour and monitoring of animal weight. Fig. 6 illustrates theweight monitoring graphs for the duration of the experiments.Weights were recorded at the beginning of each week. Each graphrepresents a MN array type and a needle density. Additionally,female and male weight records were plotted separately. It canobserved from the graphs that mouse weight increased over time,indicating that all animals remained healthy.Skin appearance was surveyed over the entire duration of thestudy. Pictures of the application area were taken before eachand every MN insertion and after each and every MN removal.
Mice were individually identiﬁed by ear punch; no ear punch leftear punch and right ear punch. Mouse identiﬁcation allowed faith-ful recording and comparison of skin pictures, TEWL measure-ments and biomarkers values for each mouse.In general, immediately after MN removal, all mice displayedmild erythema at the MN application site. This is most likely dueto MN insertion into skin and surgical tape removal. Indeed, somecontrol mice showed mild and short-lived erythema around thesite of tape removal. Importantly, erythema had universally andcompletely dissipated prior to the next MN insertion in the testanimals. No permanent skin appearance changes were noted formice to which dissolving MN were inserted, regardless of MN for-mulation or density (2 arrays per application per week over a per-iod of 5 consecutive weeks), as shown in Fig. 7 A. The hydrogel-forming MN-treated group did not show any notable skin alter-ation, even when MN arrays were inserted twice weekly over
3 weeks. Increased frequency compared to the dissolving MN didnot affect external skin appearance, as Fig. 7 B illustrates.TEWL results are illustrated in Fig. 8 . Statistical analyses werecarried out comparing TEWL values for female and male mice. Itwas veriﬁed that there was no statistical differences between gen-ders. Therefore, TEWL values were plotted on the same graphs. Thispart of the study explored skin barrier function re-establishmentafter it had been compromised in a repeated manner using high-density polymeric MN patches. In each case, TEWL was elevatedimmediately following MN removal, but had returned to baselineprior to the next scheduled MN insertion, with no statistically-signiﬁcant trends identiﬁed.3.3. Measurement of inﬂammation, irritancy and immunologicalreaction biomarkers in mouse seraEncouragingly, TNF-alevels were undetectable in all mice. Datafor the other biomarkers is presented in Fig. 9 . No statistical differ-
ences were seen between the measured biomarkers levels com-pared to one another or control, regardless of formulation type,needle density, number of applications or mouse gender ( p> 0.05in all cases). These analyses suggest that repeated insertions of dis-solving or hydrogel-forming MN arrays do not stimulate thehumoral immune system, do not produce sufﬁcient trauma to ele-vate circulating blood levels of IL-1 band do not caused infection ortrigger an inﬂammatory response cascade.4. DiscussionBy deﬁnition, MN penetrate the skin’s protection stratum cor-neum barrier and enter the viable epidermis and, in many casesthe dermis. These areas of the body are ordinarily sterile and MNare not ordinarily manufactured as sterile products. Nevertheless,only rare and isolated examples of adverse events exist and inap-propriate use was the cause in the documented cases [7].M Ninsertion typically reduces skin barrier function, as evidenced by
increases in transepidermal water loss and causes local inﬂamma-
propriate use was the cause in the documented cases [7].M Ninsertion typically reduces skin barrier function, as evidenced byincreases in transepidermal water loss and causes local inﬂamma-tion and/or irritation to the skin, illustrated by erythema andoedema [8,15,33–35] . However, these phenomena typically resolvewithin a period of several hours, with no long lasting effectsreported [8,15,33–35] . Skin recovery post MN removal is likely toinvolve inﬂammatory and lipid production processes, with prosta-glandin release [34] and cholesterol synthesis both possibly impor-tant [36]. High speed application of MN has been shown to causelocalised death of viable cells in skin [37]. This boosts immuneresponse to delivered vaccine antigens, but is likely to be undesir-able if the MN are not intended to be used in vaccination, espe-cially if they are to be inserted in skin regularly. Thesephenomena, whilst unlikely to cause prolonged adverse events,
are likely to raise questions from regulatory bodies. In spite of this,most published work on MN focuses on their design and use, rather202224262830323436Week 1 Week 2 Week 3Mice weight (g) Hydrogel 11x11Week 1 Week 2 Week 3Hydrogel 19x19202224262830323436Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5Mice weight (g)Gantrez S-97 11x11Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5GantrezS-97 19x19Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5PVP 58 kDa19x19Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5PVP 58 kDa11X11Fig. 6.

than speciﬁc safety evaluations or regulatory aspects of translationto clinic. However, it is vitally-important that any questions areaddressed at an early stage, so as not to slow progression to patientbeneﬁt and commercial return.We expect any approved MN products to be inserted into theskin of the same patient on more than one occasion, regardlessof the therapeutic indication. Indeed, Zosano Pharma [38] and Cor-ium [39] have conducted extensive clinical studies, up to comple-tion of Phase II, where coated titanium and dissolving polymericMN, respectively, were repeatedly inserted into the skin of post-menopausal women over a prolonged period of time for deliveryof parathyroid hormone analogue. No adverse events werereported, though no data on skin barrier function or serumbiomarkers was published in either case. We believe that it willbe important to show regulators that repeated insertion of MN intoskin does not disturb skin barrier function, or yield any undesirable
systemic effects. This must clearly ﬁrst be done in an animalmodel, prior to human studies and should use non-drug-loadedMN to illustrate the effect of the MN material, MN density andnumber of applications on the measured parameters. Further stud-ies would then clearly need to be done as a follow-on where drug(s) to be delivered are included in the formulations.In the present study, no signiﬁcant changes to skin appearanceor skin barrier function were observed, regardless of the MN for-mulation, needle density or number of insertions. Serum biomark-ers of irritation/inﬂammation, infection and immunity were notsigniﬁcantly disturbed by the end of the study periods. These ﬁnd-ings are encouraging for the formulations investigated, suggestingthat their repeated use by patients will not cause undesirable side-effects.Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5 ABefore MN applicationAfter MN removalBefore MN applicationAfter MN removalB Week 1 Week 2 Week 3

5. ConclusionCommercialisation will be the primary route by which patientswill beneﬁt from MN technology. In addressing potential regula-tory questions at an early stage, the ﬁeld will be ideally-placed totake advantage of the potential market. This study addressed, forthe ﬁrst time, the insertion on multiple occasions of polymericMN patches in vivo . This may ultimately reﬂect the normal patternof use of approved MN products. Since skin barrier function wasnot compromised during the study and measurement of biomark-ers of immunity, irritation/inﬂammation and infection did not raiseany concerns, we are now preparing a follow-on study with humanvolunteers using MN manufactured to GMP standards. The out-comes of such work will allow us to develop a regulatory dossierto support future applications for marketing approval.References[1]K.A. Getz, K.I.
