The particle size distribu-tion of pharmaceutical PLGA microparticle products is routinely determined with laser diffraction. In
our study, we performed a unique side-by-side comparison between MFI 5100 (ﬂow imaging micro-scopy) and Mastersizer 2000 (laser diffraction) for the particle size analysis of two commercial PLGAmicroparticle products, i.e., Risperdal Consta and Sandostatin LAR. Both techniques gave similar resultsregarding the number and volume percentage of the main particle population (28–220lm forRisperdal Consta; 16–124 lm for Sandostatin LAR). MFI additionally detected a ‘ﬁnes’ population(<28lm for Risperdal Consta; <16 lm for Sandostatin LAR), which was overlooked by Mastersizer.Moreover, MFI was able to split the main population into ‘monospheres’ and ‘agglomerates’ based on par-ticle morphology, and count the number of particles in each sub-population. Finally, we presented howMFI can be applied in process development of risperidone PLGA microparticles and to monitor the phys-ical stability of Sandostatin LAR. These case studies showed that MFI provides insight into the effect of
different process steps on the number, size and morphology of ﬁnes, monospheres and agglomeratesas well as the extent of microparticle agglomeration after reconstitution. This can be particularly impor-tant for the suspendability, injectability and release kinetics of PLGA microparticles./C2112017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

IntroductionMicroencapsulation of drugs that are otherwise rapidlydegraded or cleared from the body can prolong the therapeuticeffect from days to several weeks or months [1]. Injectablemicroparticles composed of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)polymers are one of the most successful controlled drug deliverysystems, which overcome the need of frequent injections andthereby improve patient compliance and comfort [2,3] . Better reg-ulation of the drug release rate also reduces variability in blood
levels, which increases the safety and efﬁcacy of the encapsulateddrug. PLGA microparticles largely owe their success to the biocom-patibility, biodegradability and adjustable release kinetics of PLGApolymers.Two examples of PLGA microparticle products that were suc-cessfully introduced in the clinic are Risperdal Consta and Sando-statin LAR [4]. Risperdal Consta consists of PLGA microparticlesthat are loaded with risperidone, a small hydrophobic moleculethat is used to treat schizophrenia. Adequate therapeutic levelsof risperidone are observed 3 weeks after the ﬁrst intramuscularinjection, followed by a 2-week period of action [4,5] . SandostatinLAR consists of PLGA-glucose microparticles that are loaded withoctreotide acetate, which is the acetate salt of a cyclic octapeptidethat is used to treat acromegaly. Adequate therapeutic levels ofoctreotide acetate are observed 2 weeks after the ﬁrst intramuscu-lar injection, followed by a 1-month period of action [4,6] .
that is used to treat acromegaly. Adequate therapeutic levels ofoctreotide acetate are observed 2 weeks after the ﬁrst intramuscu-lar injection, followed by a 1-month period of action [4,6] .One of the key parameters that governs drug release from PLGAmicroparticles is the particle size distribution [7]. For instance, theparticle size of risperidone PLGA microparticles was shown toaffect drug encapsulation efﬁciency, polymer degradation rateand initial burst release of the drug [8,9] . In general, smaller PLGAmicroparticles have a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio withmore drug molecules on the outer surface that are immediatelyaccessible and a larger surface available for diffusion, resulting inincreased release rates [10]. The effect will be more pronouncedif the particle porosity is high, since this enhances the particle sur-face area [11]. Moreover, the presence of larger or agglomeratedparticles can affect the suspendability and injectability of a product

[1]. For these reasons, the particle size distribution needs to beaccurately controlled during and after manufacturing. Various pro-cess parameters are known to affect size and agglomeration ofPLGA microparticles. Some factors that seem crucial for the result-ing particle size are the volume of organic phase and the methodand duration of agitation during the emulsiﬁcation step [12,13] .The most common techniques to evaluate PLGA microparticlesize are optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)and laser diffraction, which have been used since the commerciallaunch of the ﬁrst PLGA microparticle drug delivery systems inthe 1980s. In addition to particle size information, optical micro-scopy may also provide information on the tendency of PLGAmicroparticles to agglomerate [14]. A major drawback of opticalmicroscopy is that it is time-consuming due to manual sample
preparation (disposing samples onto slides) and low throughput.Multiple measurements are needed to examine a signiﬁcant num-ber of microparticles (typically 100–200) allowing calculation ofthe mean diameter. SEM suffers from similar drawbacks with alaborious sample preparation that may include freeze-drying,optional cross-sectioning, coating and sample mounting, whichmakes this technique mainly suitable for characterizing surfacemorphology and internal structure of PLGA microparticles.By contrast, laser diffraction is less time-consuming owing to amore straightforward sample preparation and a relatively largeanalysis volume at high sample concentration. The technique isbased on a laser beam that is diffracted in a speciﬁc patterndepending on the geometrical dimensions of particles in the sam-ple. The particle size distribution is derived from the angle andintensity of the scattered light, which are ﬁtted according to the
Fraunhofer and Mie theories [15]. A limitation of laser diffractionis that agglomeration of PLGA microparticles cannot be assessedsince samples are not visualized and information on particle mor-phology is lacking. Thus, the presence of agglomerates may lead toan overestimation of microparticle size.In this work, we hypothesized that the relatively new techniqueof ﬂow imaging microscopy could combine the advantages of opti-cal microscopy (visualization of individual particles) and laserdiffraction (high throughput). In recent years, ﬂow imaging micro-scopy has become increasingly popular for the sizing and countingof micron-sized particles in therapeutic protein products [16–18] .In particular, Micro-Flow Imaging (MFI) instruments became wellestablished in the ﬁeld of subvisible particle analysis [19,20] .I nMFI, microscopic images are automatically collected from a samplethat passes the optics through a ﬂow cell at a rate that is fast
enough to analyze thousands of particles in a few minutes. Particlesize is reported as the equivalent circular diameter (ECD), which isthe diameter of a circle with the same projected area as the parti-cle. In addition, information on particle count, shape and trans-parency can be obtained from the analysis software.The aims of this study were: (1) to evaluate MFI as a tool to accu-rately assess the size of PLGA microparticles, and (2) to present anapproach to detect and quantify PLGA microparticle agglomerationwith MFI. For this purpose, we compared MFI with laser diffractionfor Risperdal Consta and Sandostatin LAR, and deﬁned the differentparticle populations detected with MFI. Moreover, we showed twocase studies of the application of MFI to support process develop-ment of risperidone PLGA microparticles and to study the physicalstability of Sandostatin LAR after reconstitution.2.

Ultrapure water ( /C2118 MXcm) was obtained from a MilliQBiocel water puriﬁcation system (Millipore).2.2. PLGA microparticlesRisperdal Consta (25-mg vial, Janssen-Cilag B.V., manufacturedby Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse, Belgium, batch no. EGS6M/EBZUECO/EBSK000, exp. 01/2017) and Sandostatin LAR (30-mgvial, Novartis India, manufactured by Sandoz, Schaftenau, Austria,lot no. S0016, exp. 02/2016) were purchased locally.Risperidone-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)microparticles were prepared by using an oil-in-water (O/W)emulsion solvent extraction method. Samples were taken at differ-ent stages during the preparation process. The ﬁrst sample (‘‘emul-sion”) was collected from the O/W emulsion during the solventextraction step, the second sample (‘‘intermediate”) was collectedafter concentrating the hardened microparticles over a 25-
lmsieve, and the ﬁnal sample (‘‘ﬁnal product”) was collected afterdrying. The ﬁnal, dried product contained a targeted drug load of38% (w/w) risperidone microencapsulated in 75:25 (lactide:glycol-ide) PLGA.To monitor the physical stability of Sandostatin LAR, a 1.0 mg/ml suspension was prepared in duplicate by dispersing the productin ﬁltered diluent containing 7.0 g/l CMC, 6.0 g/l D-mannitol and2.0 g/l poloxamer 188. The sample dispersion was homogenizedand left at room temperature for at least 20 min until themicroparticles visually appeared completely wetted. Next, a 1.0-ml aliquot was removed for MFI analysis (t = 0 h). The remainingsample was divided into two portions. One portion was incubatedat 20 /C176C (room temperature) and one portion at 25 /C176C (incubatortype BD240, Binder) in glass vials (20-ml liquid scintillation vials,Sigma-Aldrich). After 4, 24 and 52 h of incubation, 1.0-ml aliquotswere removed for MFI analysis.
were removed for MFI analysis.2.3. Particle size distribution with MastersizerParticle size distributions of Risperdal Consta and SandostatinLAR were measured by using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 laserdiffraction instrument equipped with a Micro Precision Hydro2000lP sample dispersion unit (Malvern Instruments). Three mea-surements were performed per sample and two samples weretaken per product. The dispersion unit was drained and ﬂushedwith ultrapure water between sample measurements and back-ground detector intensities were checked to ensure cleanliness ofthe sample compartment.2.3.1. Mastersizer measurement of Risperdal ConstaRisperdal Consta vials were equilibrated at room temperaturefor at least 30 min prior to reconstitution. Microparticles (10 mg/ml) were dispersed in 0.01% (w/v) polysorbate 80 and sonicatedfor 1–2 min. The sample dispersions were measured within30 min upon preparation and homogenized just before measure-
ment. A sample volume of approximately 2 ml was added intothe 20-ml dispersion unit preﬁlled with ultrapure water and moresample was added until an obscuration level between 5 and 10%was reached. Stirring rate in the dispersion unit was set at1500 rpm without ultrasonication. The detector array measuredthe scattering pattern during 20 s.2.3.2. Mastersizer measurement of Sandostatin LARSandostatin LAR microparticles (24 mg/ml) were dispersed in0.3% (w/v) polysorbate 80, homogenized and left at room temper-ature for at least 15 min. The sample dispersions were homoge-nized again just before measurement. A sample volume ofapproximately 1 ml was added into the 20-ml dispersion unit92 M.M.C. van Beers et al. / European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 117 (2017) 91–104
preﬁlled with ultrapure water and more sample was added untilthe obscuration level reached a value between 4 and 6%. Stirringrate in the dispersion unit was set at 1200 rpm without ultrasoni-cation. The detector array measured the scattering pattern during30 s.2.3.3. Mastersizer data analysisThe Mastersizer raw data were analyzed with the MalvernMastersizer 2000 software (version 5.22) using the Fraunhofermodel ( ndispersant = 1.330), general purpose mode, normal calcula-tion sensitivity and assuming an irregular particle shape. Numberand volume % results were exported for particle sizes ranging from2 to 222 lm with a bin size of 4 lm. Number and volume per-centiles, spans, surface mean d[3,2] and volume mean d[4,3] wereobtained from the software. Volume-based particle size distribu-tions were ﬁtted with a medium Lowess curve (with a smoothingwindow of 10 points) in GraphPad Prism 5 (version 5.02) to deter-mine the volume mode.
mine the volume mode.2.4. Particle size distribution with Micro-Flow Imaging (MFI)MFI measurements were performed with an MFI 5100 instru-ment (featuring a ﬂow cell depth of 400 lm) equipped with ahigh-throughput BOT1 autosampler (ProteinSimple). Data wereacquired with MFI View System Software (MVSS) version 2-R4and processed with MFI View Analysis Suite (MVAS) software ver-sion 1.4.0. Sample diluents were ﬁltered through a Millex-GP 0.22-lm sterile syringe ﬁlter (Millipore). A baseline measurement wasperformed with sample diluent to ensure that less than 500 parti-cles/ml were present. Optimize illumination was performed on thesample diluent and samples were stirred 12 times at a speed of 6before they were introduced into the sample port. The samplepurge volume was set at 0.20 ml and the analyzed sample volumewas 0.571 ml. At least 3000 particles were analyzed per measure-ment and samples were measured in triplicate. The reported parti-
cle size (in lm) is the equivalent circular diameter (ECD) detectedby MFI.2.4.1. MFI sample preparationRisperdal Consta (1.0 mg/ml) and the ﬁnal, dried product ofrisperidone PLGA microparticles (1.0 mg/ml) were dispersed in ﬁl-tered diluent containing 0.5% (w/v) polysorbate 80. SandostatinLAR (0.5 mg/ml) was dispersed in ﬁltered diluent containing7.0 g/l CMC, 6.0 g/l D-mannitol and 2.0 g/l poloxamer 188. The sam-ple dispersions were homogenized and left at room temperaturefor at least 20 min until the microparticles visually appeared com-pletely wetted. Emulsion and intermediate samples of risperidonePLGA microparticles were diluted in 5% (w/v) PVA 4–88 until lessthan 13,000 particles were analyzed per measurement. Thesamples were homogenized just before transferring 1.0 ml to a96-well plate (Eppendorf) suitable for the Bot1 autosampler.2.4.2. MFI data analysisEdge particles were removed from MFI raw data with the MVAS
software. Number and volume % results were exported for particlesizes ranging from 2 to 222 lm with a bin size of 4 lm. Numberpercentiles were obtained from the software. Volume percentileswere determined from the cumulative size distribution curve,where D v10, D v50 and D v90 percentiles are the diameters at 10%,50%, and 90% cumulative particle volume, respectively. The widthof the number- and volume-based size distributions was calculatedas the span according to Eqs. (1) and (2) :Number span ¼ðDn90/C0Dn10ÞðDn50Þð1ÞVolume span ¼ðDv90/C0Dv10ÞðDv50Þð2ÞThe surface mean d[3,2] and volume mean d[4,3] were calcu-lated from MFI data of individual particles according to Eqs.

The cumulative particle vol-
ume and surface were calculated and divided by the number ofmeasured particles to obtain the mean particle volume and surface.2.4.3. Particle classiﬁcation
ume and surface were calculated and divided by the number ofmeasured particles to obtain the mean particle volume and surface.2.4.3. Particle classiﬁcationBy using the ﬁlter manager in the MVAS software, ECD andaspect ratio cutoffs were set to distinguish three different particlepopulations: ‘‘ﬁnes”, ‘‘monospheres” and ‘‘agglomerates”. A cus-tomized ﬁlter was deﬁned for each PLGA microparticle product(Fig. 1 ). For Risperdal Consta and intermediate and ﬁnal productsamples of risperidone PLGA microparticles, ﬁlter cutoffs wereFig. 1. MVAS ﬁlter manager settings for Risperdal Consta and Sandostatin LAR developed to classify particles according to three categories: ﬁnes, monosphe res andagglomerates. For in-house produced risperidone PLGA microparticles, the Risperdal Consta ﬁlter settings were used.M.M.C. van Beers et al. / European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 117 (2017) 91–104 93
set at an ECD of 28 lm and an aspect ratio of 0.85. For SandostatinLAR, ﬁlter cutoffs were set at an ECD of 16 lm and an aspect ratioof 0.89. Application of the customized ﬁlters, as shown in Fig. 1 ,was followed by visual examination of particle images of themonospheres population to identify and select any additionalagglomerates that were misclassiﬁed as monospheres. Manualselection of agglomerated particles within the monospheres popu-lation resulted in 0.1–2.7 vol% of additional agglomerates.3. Results and discussion3.1. Particle size distributions obtained with MFI versus MastersizerTwo commercial PLGA microparticle products, Risperdal Constaand Sandostatin LAR, were characterized by using the establishedMastersizer technique and the relatively novel technique of MFI(Fig. 2 ). While MFI detects individual particles and thus providesprimarily number-based results, these can be converted tovolume-based results by assuming spherically shaped particles.
The Mastersizer instrument uses the volume of particles to deter-mine their diameter, but the fundamental volume distribution canbe transformed to number distribution, also by assuming sphericalparticles, with the Mastersizer 2000 software. In order to compareMFI with Mastersizer results, particle size distributions arepresented in number % ( Fig. 2 A and C) as well as volume %(Fig. 2 B and D).Number and volume size distributions measured with Master-sizer and MFI were substantially similar for the main particle frac-tion of Risperdal Consta (between 28 lm and 220 lm) andSandostastin LAR (between 16 lm and 124 lm). However, an addi-tional fraction of smaller particles (<28 lm for Risperdal Constaand <16 lm for Sandostatin LAR) was clearly visible with MFI,but not with Mastersizer, in the number-based size distribution(Fig. 2 A and C). Also, modelling the Mastersizer raw data according

Mastersizer results are the mean of two samples each me asured in triplicate(±standard deviation). MFI results are the mean of three samples (+standard deviation). (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader isreferred to the web version of this article.)94 M.M.C. van Beers et al. / European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 117 (2017) 91–104
to the Mie instead of Fraunhofer theory or using the analysis model‘‘multiple narrow modes” instead of the ‘‘general purpose mode”did not allow detection of the smaller particles in presence of themain PLGA microparticle fraction (data not shown).This discrepancy between Mastersizer and MFI was reﬂected inthe number percentiles and number span values calculated forboth products, while volume percentiles and volume span valuescorresponded well between the two techniques ( Table 1 ). In partic-ular, the D n10 values measured with MFI were much smaller thanthose measured with Mastersizer (3.6 ± 0.4 lmvs.39.3 ± 0.9 lmfor Risperdal Consta; 2.1 ± 0.0 lmvs.30.9 ± 1.0 lm for SandostatinLAR), because Mastersizer did not detect the smaller particle frac-tion. Accordingly, number span values reported by MFI were signif-icantly larger than those reported by Mastersizer (1.88 ± 0.02 vs.0.95 ± 0.02 for Risperdal Consta; 1.52 ± 0.02 vs.0.72 ± 0.04 for San-
dostatin LAR), due to the wider number size distribution detectedwith MFI.A similar observation was done by Farrell et al. [21], who ana-lyzed cell culture microcarriers with Mastersizer and MFI. Theresearchers showed that MFI was able to detect smaller particles(<50lm) that were overlooked by Mastersizer in presence of lar-ger particles (with an average ECD of 176 lm), and explained thisby the difference in measurement principle (i.e., number-basedversus volume-based). Smaller particles are probably missed bythe Mastersizer because the light scattering signal, which relatesto volume % rather than number %, is dominated by the larger par-ticles. In addition, Mastersizer measures all particles simultane-ously and gives an approximate representation of the volumedistribution, whereas MFI measures individual particles [21]. Thisalso explains why our Mastersizer results appear as smooth aver-aged curves, while MFI results are much more affected by the pres-
ence of individual particles ( Fig. 2 ).The particle sizes of Risperdal Consta reported in the literaturelay between 25 and 150 lm[22], with an approximate average sizeof 0.1 mm [23], and the reported average size of Sandostatin LARdetected by scanning electron microscopy is about 50 lm[24].The volume means d[4,3] of Risperdal Consta and SandostatinLAR that we measured with MFI (92.3 ± 3.8 lm and57.2 ± 0.7 lm, respectively) closely match those measured withTable 1Particle size distribution characteristics of Risperdal Consta and Sandostatin LAR measured with Mastersizer and Micro-Flow Imaging (MFI). Numbe r and volume percentiles andspan values are shown, as well as other relevant particle size distribution characteristics that can be calculated from Mastersizer and/or MFI data.

Mastersizer (94.4 ± 0.3 lm and 56.6 ± 0.4 lm, respectively)(Table 1 ), and also agree with literature values. Importantly, MFIprovides additional number-based information that is not avail-able with Mastersizer such as particle concentration, mean particlesurface and mean particle volume ( Table 1 ). Moreover, MFI showshigher sensitivity towards sample-to-sample or batch-to-batchvariations owing to its ability to measure individual particles andprovide information about their morphology (see Section 3.2).These major advantages can be of great importance for the purposeof pharmaceutical development and quality control of PLGAmicroparticle products.3.2. Particle classiﬁcation with MFI in Risperdal Consta andSandostatin LARMFI, as an imaging technique, not only provides the ECD of indi-vidual particles, but also gives information on particle morphology.One of those morphological parameters is the aspect ratio, deﬁned
as ‘‘the ratio of the minor axis length over the major axis length ofan ellipse that has the same second-moments as the particle” withvalues ranging from 0 to 1 (no units; 1 for a perfect circle) [25].Based on a scatter plot of aspect ratio as a function of ECD, threedistinct particle populations could be distinguished in RisperdalConsta and Sandostatin LAR ( Fig. 3 ).The population deﬁned as ‘‘ﬁnes” consisted of the smaller par-ticle fraction (<28 lm for Risperdal Consta and <16 lm for Sando-statin LAR) and displayed a wide range of aspect ratios from 0.28 to1, which suggests that the shape of these particles varied from rod-like or ﬁbrous to perfectly spherical. Particle images correspondingto the ﬁnes captured by MFI indeed showed a wide variety ofshapes ( Fig. 4 ). A clear size gap was present in the scatter plotsof both products between the ﬁnes and two other populations,i.e., ‘‘monospheres” and ‘‘agglomerates”. Monospheres appeared
to be close to spherical with aspect ratios >0.85 for Risperdal Con-sta and /C210.89 for Sandostatin LAR, whereas agglomerates con-sisted of multiple spheres resulting in lower aspect ratios ( Figs. 3and 4 ).A ﬁlter was developed in MVAS based on the mentioned ECDand aspect ratio cutoffs ( Fig. 1 ). To verify the ability of the ﬁlterto distinguish agglomerates from monospheres, the images ofparticles deﬁned as monospheres were visually examined. In gen-eral, this resulted in the identiﬁcation of a few volume percent ofadditional agglomerates with high aspect ratios (>0.85), such asthe agglomerates (red1open squares) that can be seen within themonospheres population (blue open circles) in Risperdal Consta(Fig. 3 A). Based on the MVAS ﬁlters combined with visual examina-tion, separate number and volume size distributions could be gener-ated for the ﬁnes, monospheres and agglomerates in RisperdalConsta and Sandostatin LAR ( Fig. 5 ). Also, the number %, volume %,
Dv50, volume span and volume mode were calculated for each par-ticle population ( Table 2 ).Although the ﬁnes contributed considerably to the total numberof particles (16.5 ± 0.9% and 37.2 ± 0.4%, respectively for RisperdalConsta and Sandostatin LAR), their contribution to the total particlevolume was negligible (<0.05% for both products). The nature ofthese ﬁnes could be extrinsic (contaminants), intrinsic (related tothe drug product) or inherent (originating from the drug product)Fig. 4. Exemplary images of particles in Risperdal Consta and Sandostatin LAR captured with Micro-Flow Imaging (MFI). Particles are divided into three diff erent categories,i.e., ﬁnes, monospheres and agglomerates, based on their equivalent circular diameter (ECD) and aspect ratio provided by the MFI View Analysis Suite (MVAS) software.1For interpretation of color in Figs. 3 and 9, the reader is referred to the web

[16]. We cannot exclude that some of the ﬁnes consisted of extrin-sic particles, such as dust or hair fragments, that contaminated thesample during sample preparation or MFI measurement. As a con-trol, baseline measurements were performed with sample diluent,which generally showed particle concentrations that were 5–10times lower than the ﬁnes population in commercial PLGAmicroparticle samples (data not shown). Thus, most likely mainlyintrinsic and/or inherent particles were present in the ﬁnes popu-lation. In the case of cell culture microcarriers, researchers sug-gested that the main particle fraction was accompanied by asmaller particle fraction originating from debris produced duringmanufacturing of the microcarriers [21]. In the case of PLGAmicroparticles, debris in the form of ﬁne PLGA particles or frag-ments may have been formed during the Risperdal Consta and San-dostatin LAR manufacturing processes.The main particle population produced during manufacturing
consisted of monospheres with a D v50 of 85.1 ± 1.1 lm for Ris-perdal Consta and 48.5 ± 0.5 lm for Sandostatin LAR ( Table 2 ).Risperdal Consta monospheres showed slightly lower aspect ratiosand broader size distributions (span value 0.83 ± 0.03) thanSandostatin LAR monospheres (span value 0.48 ± 0.02). Besidesﬁnes and monospheres, a considerable volume fraction of agglom-erated PLGA microparticles was present in Risperdal Consta(25.1 ± 3.8%) and Sandostatin LAR (31.4 ± 1.7%). These agglomer-ates may have been formed during manufacturing and/or storageof the products. Moreover, Risperdal Consta agglomerates gener-ally consisted of two or three PLGA microparticles that wereslightly misshaped, whereas Sandostatin LAR agglomerates con-sisted of two, three or multiple PLGA microparticles that werenearly spherical ( Fig. 4 ). These differences in particle characteris-tics may be the result of the different encapsulation techniques
associated with the two commercial products, i.e., O/W emulsionsolvent extraction for Risperdal Consta and coacervation forSandostatin LAR [26]. Also, PLGA properties (such as PLGA versusPLGA-glucose star polymer, co-monomer ratio, molecular weight),drug properties of risperidone (a small hydrophobic molecule)Fig. 5.

versus octreotide acetate (acetate salt of a cyclic octapeptide), for-mulation of the product and storage conditions can have an effecton the size distribution and agglomeration behavior of themicroparticles.In general, formulation and process parameters as well as stor-age conditions can have a large impact on the size characteristics ofPLGA microparticles, affecting the drug release proﬁle and thus theefﬁcacy and safety in patients. Our results show that MFI is anexcellent tool for in-depth PLGA microparticle characterization.Not only the size distribution and morphology of the main particlepopulation (monospheres) can be assessed, but MFI also enables usto distinguish and quantify other populations such as ﬁnes andagglomerates.3.3. Case study 1: process development of risperidone PLGAmicroparticlesHere, we present an example of applying MFI as a tool to mon-itor particle size and agglomeration during the manufacturing pro-
cess of a PLGA microparticle product. One batch of risperidoneloaded PLGA microparticles was prepared in-house by using anO/W emulsion solvent extraction method. Formulation and processparameters were chosen to obtain a ﬁnal product with similarproperties as Risperdal Consta (38% (w/w) drug loading, 75:25 (lac-tide:glycolide) PLGA, and similar particle size distribution). Tostudy the effect of certain process steps on particle characteristics,samples were taken at three different stages during the prepara-tion of risperidone PLGA microparticles and measured off-line withMFI.The ﬁrst sample (‘‘emulsion”) was collected during the solventextraction step after emulsiﬁcation. During emulsiﬁcation, theorganic phase containing risperidone and PLGA was mixed withan aqueous, continuous phase in presence of a stabilizing agentto form emulsion droplets. Subsequently, the O/W emulsion wasadded to a large volume of aqueous phase to remove solvent from
the emulsion droplets (solvent extraction). The size distribution ofthe emulsion droplets, which are the precursors of microparticles,may depend on stabilizer concentration, viscosity, mixing time,and amount of shear applied during emulsiﬁcation [7,12,27,28] .For example, the speed of stirring during emulsiﬁcation was shownto affect particle size and the extent of agglomeration in the ﬁnal,lyophilized PLGA microparticle product [29]. Thus, processparameters during the emulsiﬁcation phase will provide a basisfor the size distribution of the ﬁnal product.Interestingly, the emulsion droplets in our sample did not showdistinct particle populations according to the scatter plot ( Fig. 6 A).There was no size gap present at lower ECD values in the particlesize distribution ( Fig. 7 A and B), indicating that a distinct ﬁnes pop-ulation was not present yet at this stage of the manufacturing pro-cess. Moreover, emulsion droplets in the full ECD range appeared
as individual spheres and examination of MFI images did not revealany agglomerates. An explanation for the absence of agglomeratesmay be that if one emulsion droplet encounters another droplet,Fig. 6.

they will easily merge to form a larger droplet. Thus, the emulsionsample consisted of monospheres only with a D v50 of86.5 ± 3.7 lm and a relatively wide volume span of 1.58 ± 0.53(Table 3 ).The second sample (‘‘intermediate”) contained wet microparti-cles collected on a 25- lm sieve after the solvent extraction step(Fig. 6 B). Solvent removal caused the emulsion droplets to solidifyand form hardened microparticles. Particle size and morphologyFig. 7.

can be affected by the rate of solvent extraction, which is con-trolled by the aqueous phase composition, co-solvent concentra-tion, solid-to-liquid ratio, temperature, and stirring speed [30,31] .The scatter plot of our intermediate sample revealed the presenceof the same three types of particle populations as described in theprevious section, i.e., ﬁnes, monospheres and agglomerates(Fig. 6 B).The corresponding number size distribution indicated that thetotal number percentage of particles smaller than 28 lm in theintermediate sample was much lower than in the emulsion sample,and the intermediate sample also showed a clear size gap betweenthe ﬁnes and monospheres population ( Fig. 7 C). This is probablybecause the sieving step removed many particles smaller than25lm, but not all of them. The efﬁciency of sieving may not be100% due to adherence of small particles to the surface of largerparticles that are unable to travel through the sieve. This type of
sieving might also explain the presence of the ﬁnes population inthe two commercial products, Risperdal Consta and SandostatinLAR.Importantly, the solvent extraction and wet sieving step did notseem to affect the D v50 of the monospheres (emulsion86.5 ± 3.7 lm; intermediate 86.1 ± 0.9 lm), but it caused the for-mation of 12.1 ± 0.2 vol% of agglomerates with a D v50 of133.2 ± 19.2 lm(Table 3 ). There may be several reasons foragglomeration at this stage. One possible reason may be that themicroparticles were not fully solidiﬁed due to a relatively highresidual solvent content, resulting in a higher tendency to agglom-erate in the concentrating and sieving process [7,13,31,32] . Also, astabilizer concentration that is too high may result in an increasednumber of agglomerated microparticles during solidiﬁcation [26].Lastly, a sample of the ﬁnal, dried product was measured withMFI ( Fig. 6 C). Again, the three particle populations could clearly
be detected ( Fig. 7 E). Although the ﬁnes did not signiﬁcantly con-tribute to the volume distribution ( Fig. 7 F), the number percentageof ﬁnes was enhanced in the ﬁnal product (50.6 ± 21.0%) comparedwith the intermediate sample (11.1 ± 0.7%) ( Table 3 ). A reason forthis may be that additional ﬁnes could have been released fromlarger particles during the ﬁnal drying step, which included shearforces.Furthermore, an increase in the D v50 of the total particle popu-lation was observed compared with the intermediate sample(intermediate 89.3 ± 1.4 lm; ﬁnal product 112.3 ± 1.7 lm)(Table 3 ). The increase in the D v50 of the total particle populationcould not be explained by a growth in the size of themicroparticles, but was due to a remarkable increase in volumepercentage of agglomerates (intermediate 12.1 ± 0.2%; ﬁnalproduct 56.1 ± 1.2%). The D v50 of the monospheres populationeven decreased (intermediate 86.1 ± 0.9 lm; ﬁnal product
78.3 ± 1.2 lm), likely due to shrinkage of the particles upon drying.It is clear that, in our case study, the ﬁnal drying step was primarilyresponsible for the high degree of agglomeration. With this knowl-edge one may be able to adjust the process parameters in order toprevent agglomeration. For instance, the use of an aqueous solu-tion of mannitol was reported to prevent agglomeration uponfreeze-drying of risperidone PLGA microparticles [8].In summary, MFI provides detailed insight into the impact ofsuccessive process steps on PLGA microparticle characteristics.More speciﬁc, microparticle size and the formation of different par-ticle populations can be followed during the preparation process.Information obtained with this technique provides a basis for ﬁnd-ing the right process parameters to achieve an optimal particle sizedistribution that gives the desired suspendability, injectability andrelease kinetics.

release kinetics.In this case study we have shown results from off-line MFI anal-yses, but in future applications it may even be possible to deployMFI for on-line measurements. Following a quality-by-designapproach, one could imagine employing MFI as process analyticaltechnology tool during PLGA microparticle manufacturing [33],e.g., to decide when to stop the emulsiﬁcation process (at steadystate or at the desired droplet size). Moreover, it seems to be asuitable and relatively straightforward method for the purpose ofquality control.3.4. Case study 2: monitoring the physical stability of Sandostatin LARIn addition to manufacturing process parameters, it is impor-tant to assess the impact of transport, storage and handling onthe (particle) characteristics of PLGA microparticle products, sincethese may signiﬁcantly impact product quality. For this reason, thephysical stability of PLGA microparticle products should be evalu-ated before and after reconstitution.
ated before and after reconstitution.Sandostatin LAR dry powder is relatively stable for a prolongedperiod of time at 2–8 /C176C, or for at least 1 h at room temperature [6].However, after mixing the Sandostatin LAR dry powder with thediluent, the drug suspension must be administered immediately(within 2–3 min) because of the high tendency of the microparti-cles to agglomerate after reconstitution [6,34] . In case of micropar-ticle agglomeration, it becomes difﬁcult or even impossible toTable 3Particle size distribution characteristics of the different populations (i.e. ﬁnes, monospheres and agglomerates) in the emulsion, intermediate , and ﬁnal product of risperidonePLGA microparticles measured with Micro-Flow Imaging.

inject the Sandostatin LAR drug suspension, leading to productloss. This is in sharp contrast with Risperdal Consta, which canbe kept at 25 /C176C for up to 6 h after reconstitution withoutinjectability issues [35]. In this case study, we evaluated the phys-ical stability of Sandostatin LAR after reconstitution, by monitoringparticle size and agglomeration in time with MFI.Directly after reconstitution and complete suspension of thedrug product, a ﬁrst baseline MFI measurement (0 h) was per-formed ( Fig. 8 A). The volume-based particle size distributions ofﬁnes, monospheres and agglomerates corresponded well withthose previously measured in Sandostatin LAR ( Fig. 5 D). After 4 hof incubation at 25 /C176C, several larger agglomerates (>124 lm) wereformed and the volume percentage of agglomerates in the com-plete size range appeared to increase, while the volume percentageof monospheres decreased ( Fig. 8 B). A further increase in volume
percentage of agglomerates and a concomitant decrease in volumepercentage of monospheres were apparent at 24 and 52 h(Fig. 8 C and D). In contrast, no signiﬁcant changes were observedover time in the size distributions of the ﬁnes, monospheres andagglomerates during incubation of reconstituted Sandostatin LARat 20 /C176C for up to 52 h (data not shown).Importantly, incubation at 25 /C176C resulted in a signiﬁcantdecrease in the total particle concentration, expressed as numberof particles per ml ( Fig. 9 A, black line, closed triangles). This wascaused by a decrease in the number of monospheres ( Fig. 9 A, blueline, closed circles), which logically was relatively large comparedwith the smaller increase in the number of agglomerates ( Fig. 9 A,red line, closed squares). This implies that two or more mono-spheres attached to each other to form one agglomerate. Ongoingagglomeration also resulted in a signiﬁcantly larger volume span
of the agglomerates at 52 h than at 0 h, pointing to widening ofthe size distribution for this population ( Fig. 9 B).The median particle size (D v50) of the total particle populationshifted to larger sizes in the course of time, which was not due toFig. 8.

Results are the mean of two samples (+standarddeviation). Incubation of reconstituted Sandostatin LAR at 20 /C176C for 4, 24 and 52 h did not result in a signiﬁcant change in the size distribution (data not shown).M.M.C. van Beers et al. / European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 117 (2017) 91–104 101
an increase in the Dv50 of the ﬁnes, monospheres or agglomerates(Fig. 9 C). However, the Dv50 shift of the total particle populationcould be explained by a substantial increase in the volume per-centage of agglomerates (from 37.5 ± 2.3% at 0 h to 73.9 ± 1.0% at52 h), together with an equivalent decrease in the volume percent-age of monospheres (from 62.4 ± 2.3% at 0 h to 26.1 ± 1.0% at 52 h)(Fig. 9 D). Remarkably, there was no signiﬁcant increase or decreasein the volume percentage of any of the populations for reconsti-tuted Sandostatin LAR incubated at 20 /C176C for 52 h ( Fig. 9 D).The substantial agglomeration propensity of reconstituted San-dostatin LAR at 25 /C176C may be related to the use of PLGA-glucosestar polymer instead of the normal PLGA polymer. In PLGA-glucose star polymer, the free acid end groups of PLGA are reactedwith the hydroxyl groups of a core glucose unit, forming a star-shaped structure. PLGA-glucose has several advantages over con-
ventional PLGA for encapsulating proteins and peptides (such asoctreotide) [36]. Most importantly, it limits the initial burst releasethat poses a serious threat in terms of toxicity. It also featureslonger polymer degradation times and reduced risk of acylationof the encapsulated protein or peptide, owing to the absence of freeacid end groups.Another characteristic of PLGA-glucose microparticles is thathydration is enhanced due to the presence of the hydrophilic glu-cose core [37–39] . The Tgof PLGA-based products is known todecrease tremendously upon hydration following reconstitution[40,41] . Kang et al. [39] concluded that the polymer chains at thesurface of PLGA-glucose microparticles rapidly became more ﬂex-ible within 2 h of hydration and formed a nonporous ﬁlm on thepreviously porous surface. We suggest that in our case study theTgof the PLGA-glucose polymers on the surface of reconstitutedSandostatin LAR decreased to a temperature close to 25 /C176C within
4 h of reconstitution. Incubation at 25 /C176C, but not at 20 /C176C, mayhave modiﬁed the surface of the reconstituted PLGA-glucosemicroparticles, resulting in reduced physical and colloidal stability,which led to enhanced agglomeration.4. Final remarks and conclusionsIn this study, we reported the use of MFI (a ﬂow imaging micro-scope) to characterize PLGA microparticles that serve as drug deliv-ery systems for small molecules or peptides. The size distributionof PLGA microparticles is commonly assessed with a static lightscattering or laser diffraction instrument such as Mastersizer. Thetwo techniques, Mastersizer and MFI, are based on different mea-Fig. 9. Stability of Sandostatin LAR monitored with Micro-Flow Imaging and measured at 0, 4, 24 and 52 h after reconstitution.

surement principles and display unique capabilities for particlesize analysis ( Table 4 ).We showed that Mastersizer and MFI measured similarvolume-based size distributions for the total particle populationof two commercial PLGA microparticle products ( Fig. 2 B and D).We also demonstrated two key advantages of MFI over Master-sizer: (1) MFI provides an actual number-based size distributiondue to the detection of individual particles (=quantitative method),and (2) MFI enables the classiﬁcation of PLGA microparticles intodistinct particle populations (i.e., ﬁnes, monospheres and agglom-erates) based on morphological characteristics.The size, quantity and morphology of particles in these sub-populations are important quality attributes of a PLGA microparti-cle product. For instance, if the size of the monospheres decreases,this will increase the surface-area-to-volume ratio and thusincrease the rate of drug diffusing out of the particles [42]. Also,
water will more easily enter smaller particles owing to their largersurface area, resulting in an enhanced ‘‘burst release” effect andmore rapid hydrolytic degradation of PLGA polymers. On the otherhand, an increase in PLGA microparticle size results in a decrease inparticle surface area, which will lead to a decrease in drug releaserate [43].One particularly interesting application of MFI in the analysis ofPLGA microparticles is that it can determine whether a shift to lar-ger sizes in a product is due to particles growing in size or particleagglomeration. In case of particle growth, one would expect to seea reduction in drug release rate. By contrast, agglomeration of par-ticles would result in accelerated drug release due to the retentionof acidic PLGA degradation products inside the agglomerates,which auto-catalyze hydrolysis of the polymers [26,44] . Moreover,the surface area of an agglomerate consisting of multiple micropar-
ticles that are fused together is substantially larger than that of onelarge microparticle with the same diameter as the agglomerate.Lastly, agglomeration not only affects drug release rate but mayalso compromise suspendability and injectability of a PLGAmicroparticle product [43].In conclusion, we have presented MFI as a valuable tool toassess the size and agglomeration of PLGA microparticles, whichcan serve to promote insight into the relationship between the for-mulation and process parameters, particle characteristics, physicalstability, drug release and (ultimately) the clinical efﬁcacy of thesetypes of products.AcknowledgmentsThe authors acknowledge Theo Krikken and Kor Kostwinder fortheir help with performing MFI and Mastersizer measurements,and Jeroen van Vught for his valuable suggestions and scientiﬁcdiscussion.
