Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate food-drug interactions associated with PL extract mediated by cytochrome P450 3AʢCYP3Aʣinhibition and induction.  Inhibition of CYP3A-mediated midazolamʢMDZʣ1`-hydroxylation activity by PL extract and its major phenolic components was evaluated in vitro  using pooled human liver microsomes.  In addition, M DZ pharmacokinetics were investigated in rats after a single dose, as well as after 1 week treatment with PL extract ʢ30 mg / kg ʣin order to evaluate the inhibitory
and inducible effects of PL on CYP3A in vivo , respectively.  Serum MDZ concen-trations were analyzed and pharmacokinetic parameters were compared between PL- and water ʢcontrolʣ-treated groups.  In vitro , PL extract decreased MDZ 1`-hydroxy lation activity in a concentration-dependent manner.  However, the major phenolic compounds in PL extracts, namely caffeic, chlorogenic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and vanillic acids, did not exhibit any marked inhibitory effects on MDZ 1 `-hydrox-ylation activity.  In vivo , administration of a single dose of PL extract to rats signi/f_icantly increased the area under the serum concentration-time curve from  time 0 to infinity ʢAUC 0–㱣ʣand the maximum serum concentration ʢCmaxʣof MDZʢby 57ˋ and 88ˋ, respectively ; Pʻ0.05ʣ.  In contrast, there were no signi/f_icant changes in MDZ pharmacokinetic parameters after 1 week of treatment with PL extract.  These results suggest that PL extract can cause a food-drug interaction by inhibiting CYP3A.

However, sunscreen needs to be reapplied frequently, and is difficult to use to achieve a demonstrably adequate effect.  Therefore, oral Original1ʣ  Department of Pharmacology, Showa University School of Medicine,  1—5-8 Hatanodai, Shinagawa-ku, T okyo 142-8555, Japan.2ʣDepartment of Dermatology, Showa University School of Medicine.3ʣFaculty of Arts and Sciences at Fujiyoshida, Showa University.ˎ T o whom corresponding should be addressed.
Yurika G OMI, et al 30supplements have recently attracted attention as an alternative and easier method of sunburn prevention than topical application1ʣ.ɹPolypodium leucotomos ʢPLʣis a fern native to Latin America, and its extract is expected to have photoprotective benefits through its antioxidative, chemoprotective, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory effects2ʣ.  The major active ingredients of PL are phenolic compounds, such as caffeic, chlorogenic, and ferulic acids, which are effective for the treatment of vitiligo, chloasma, and polymorphous light eruption, as well as in the prevention of skin cancer2—8ʣ.  In Japan, PL extract is easily purchased as an oral supplement on Internet shopping sites and in drugstores, so its use has become widespread.  Therefore, it is possible that PL e xtract and other medicines may be taken simultaneously, but the safety of the combined use of PL with other medications has not been studied.
has not been studied.  ɹIt is well known that drug-drug interactions may occur, and these need to be considered when coadministering multiple drugs.  These drug-drug interactions may attenuate the effects of coadministered medicines or cause unexpected adverse effects, and so att ention should be paid to avoid such interactions.  Induction and inhibition of cytochrome P450 ʢCYPʣ, a typical drug-metabolizing enzyme, are considered major causes of drug-drug interactions.  Cytochrome P450 3AʢCYP3Aʣ, a CYP isoform, is expressed not only in the liver, but also in the small intestine, and it is involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including erythromycin, cyclosporine, and nifedipine.  Therefore, CYP3A is important when considering drug-drug interactions9—11ʣ.  ɹIn addition to drug-drug interactions, several food-drug interactions have been identified.  For example, grapefruit juice ʢGFJʣhas been reported to inhibit CYP3A in the small intestine,
thereby increasing blood concentrations of coadministered nifedipine, with a 1.5-fold increase in the area under the serum co ncentration-time curve ʢAUCʣ12ʣ.  In contrast, St. John `s WortʢSJWʣis known to induce hepatic and small intestinal CYP3A, markedly lowering blood concentrations of simvastatin and decreasing its AUC by approximately half13ʣ.  Therefore, the effectiveness and safety of medicines may be altered in combination with foods.  However, information regarding such potential interactions is currently limited .  Because supplements are classified as lfoodz in Japan, it is not a legal requirement to conduct research on potential interactions between supplements and drugs.  However, to prevent clinical adverse events, it is important to clarify potential food-drug interactions associated with CYP3A, which is involved in the metabolism of many drugs.ɹAlthough recently PL extract has become widely used by people of all generations as a
simple and alternative method to the administration of sunscreen, its safety in combination with medicines has not been investigated.  Against this background, the present study was conducted to clarify food-drug interactions mediated by inhibition and induction of CYP3A by PL extract.Material and methods ChemicalsɹHeliocare, which contains 240 mg PL extract in each c apsuleʢ480 mgʣ, was purchased from Ferndale Healthcare ʢFerndale, MI, USA ʣ.  Caffeic, chlorogenic, and vanillic acids were purchased

Midazolam ʢMDZʣmaleate was a kind gift from Nippon Roche ʢT okyo, Japan ʣ.  MDZ injection ʢDormicum injection 10 mg / 2 ml ʣwas purchased from Astellas Pharma ʢTokyo, Japan ʣ, 1`-hydroxymidazolam was purchased from Daiichi Pure Chemicals ʢTokyo, Japan ʣ, and diazepam and nitrazepam were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries ʢOsaka, Japan ʣ.  Pooled human liver microsomes were purchased from the Non Profit Organization Human and Animal Bridging Research Organization ʢChiba, Japan ʣ.  All other chemicals used were of analytical grade.Assay of CYP3A activityɹAn in vitro  study was undertaken to investigate the inhibitory effect of PL extract and its major phenolic components, namely caffeic, chlorogenic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and vanillic acids,
on CYP3A-mediated MDZ 1 `-hydroxylation ʢMDZ 1`-OHʣactivity using pooled human liver microsomes.  ɹHeliocare was suspended in distilled water to a concentration of 240 mg / ml PL extract, vortexed for 5 min, centrifuged at 1,600 ºg for 10 min at room temperature, and the resultant supernatant w as collected and considered as a 100 ˋ extract solution.  Then, the solution was diluted with distilled water to final concentrations ranging from 2.5 ˋ to 10ˋ and used for in vitro experiments ; the five phenolic compounds were used at final concentrations ranging from 5 to 500 µg / ml.ɹThe reaction mixtures consisted of pooled human liver microsomes ʢ100 µgʣ, 10 µM MDZ, and the nicotinamide adenine dinuc leotide phosphate ʢNADPH ʣ-generating system in 80 mM phosphate buffer ʢpH 7 .4ʣ.  Mixtures were incubated at 37 C for 5 min in the presence of either PL extract or any of the five phenolic compounds at the different concentrations tested.
Reactions were quenched by the addition of a mixture of cold methanol : acetonitrile ʢ35 : 21ʣ, and then nitrazepam ʢ200 ngʣwas added as an internal standard.  Then, 1 `-hydroxymidazolam was analyzed using HPLC according to the methods of Wrighton and Ring14ʣ.  Control activity was determined under the same conditions with reaction mixtures containing water instead of PL extract or phenolic compounds.  Results are expressed as a percentage of control activity.  Inhibition constant ʢKiʣvalues and inhibition modes were determined for PL extract.ɹIn addition, a preincub ation study was performed to determine whether metabolic intermediates produced from the PL extract components inactivate CYP3A.  In these studies, PL extractʢ1.25ˋʣ was preincubated with pooled human liver microsomes at 37 C for 10, 20, or 30 min in the presence or absence of NADPH.  After the preincubation step, 10 µM MDZ was added and MDZ 1 `-OH activity was assayed as described above.
AnimalsɹMale Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200–230 g were obtained from Japan Laboratory AnimalsʢTokyo, Japan ʣ.  Rats were housed in a temperature-controlled room under a 12-h light-dark cycle with free access to standard laboratory chow and water.  Rats were starved overnight
Yurika G OMI, et al 32before the day of the pharmacokinetic experiments.  The study procedures were reviewed and approved by the Showa University Ethics Committee for Animal Care and Use and the experiments were conducted in accordance with guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Showa University ʢPermit no.07002 ʣand the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory An imalsʢ8th edition ʣof the National Institutes of Health ʢNIHʣhttps://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/guide-for-the-care-and-use-of-laboratory-animals.pdf, accessed 2017 -6-14 ʣ.Treatment and samplingɹIn the single treatment study, PL extract ʢ30 mg / kg ; corresponding to 60 mg / kg Heliocare ʣor water ʢcontrolʣwas administered orally to rats ʢnʹ3—4ʣ30 min before oral administration of MDZ ʢ15 mg / kg ʣ.  In the 1 -week tre atment study, rats ʢnʹ6ʣwere treated with PL extractʢ30 mg / kg ʣor water orally once a day for 1 week, and MDZ was administered 24 h after the
last administration of extract or water.  Blood samples ʢ200 µlʣwere collected from the jugular vein before and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min after MDZ administration.  Samples were centrifuged at 7 ,500 ºg for 10 min at 4 C, and each serum sample was s tored at 80C until analysis.  ɹAfter blood sampling of rats treated for 1 week with PL extract, the rats were killed and their livers and small intestines excised.  Liver and intestinal microsomes were prepared using a conventional fractional centrifugation method15ʣ and previously described methods with minor modifications16, 17ʣ, respectively.  All microsomal fractions were frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at 80C until use.  Protein concentrations were measured using the method of Lowry et al18ʣ.  ɹMDZ pharmacokinetic analysisɹMDZ serum concentrations were determined using previously described HPLC methods19—21ʣ
19—21ʣwith slight modifications.  The pharmacokinetic parameters of MDZ were assessed using non-compartmental analysis with MOMENT ʢExcel ; Microsoft, Bellevue, WA, USA ʣbased on  the moment analytic method22, 23ʣ.  The AUC from time 0 to infinity ʢAUC 0–㱣ʣwas calculated according to the trapezoidal rule.  The maximum serum concentration ʢCmaxʣwas obtained from the actual data.  The elimination half-life ʢt½ʣwas calculated by dividing ln2 by Е, which is the terminal elimination rate constant calculated using a linear regression analysis of at least three points from the termina l portion of the concentration-time plot.Ex vivo studyɹLiver and intestinal microsomes, prepared 1 day after the last administration of PL extract in the 1 -week treatment study, were used in the ex vivo  study.  Because MDZ is known to be predominantly metabolized to 4-hydroxymidazolam and, to a lesser extent, 1 `-hydroxymidazolam
by hepatic and intestinal CYP3A in rats, we analyzed MDZ 4-hydroxylat ionʢMDZ 4-OH ʣactivity as described previously24, 25ʣ.

during incubation, MDZ 1 `-OH activity was assayed by including a 10- to 30-min preincubation step.

Yurika G OMI, et al 36contains phenolic compounds, such as caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic, hydroxycinnamic, p-coumaric, and vanillic acids, which have been reported to be the active ingredients mediating the sunscreen effect of PL extract2ʣ.  To investigate whether these compounds are involved in PL-induced inhibition of CYP3A, we examined the CYP3A-inhibiting activity of each of the compounds separa tely.  In contrast with PL extract, none of the phenolic compounds significantly inhibited CYP3A activity.  The concentration range of the compounds used in this study ʢ5-500 µg / ml ʣis considered sufficiently high based on estimated amounts transported in the blood after treatment with PL extract26ʣ.  Therefore, the lack of any significant inhibition of CYP3A by these five compounds suggests that oth er components of PL extract likely contributed to its inhibition of CYP3A.ɹThe Heliocare used in this study contains 240 mg PL extract and it is recommended that 1 -2
capsules be consumed per day.  Although the types of ingredients and their amounts entering the blood after administration of PL extract are not known, we could assume that there are relatively high concentrations in the small intestin e, indicating that possible drug interactions via intestinal CYP3A inhibition should be considered.  In the present in vitro  study, because the PL extract was suspended in water, as described in the Materials and Methods, and the supernatant was considered to be a 100 ˋ PL extract, we consider that there are likely to be fewer ingredients, in lower amounts, than that actually ingested after taking a Heliocare capsule.  Therefore, it is fully conceivable that the inhibition of CYP3A observed in vitro  was the result of treatment with the PL extract.ɹIn this study, we also performed in vivo  experiments using rats to clarify whether this CYP3A-mediated food-drug interaction occurs in vivo .  Following treatment with a single dose of PL
extract, there were significant increases in both the ACU0–㱣 and C max of MDZ compared with the control group.  However, it should be noted that the 60 mg / kg dose of Heliocare used in our in vivo  studyʢ30 mg / kg as PL extract ʣwas 7 .5-fold higher than the usual dose in humans.  However, efficacious drug doses are generally higher in rats than in humans.  Therefore, the Fig.ç5.ççEffects of 1 week treatment of rats with Polypodium leucotomos ʢPLʣextract on cytochrome P450 3A ʢCYP3Aʣactivity    Rats were pretreated with PL extract ʢ30 mg / kg ʣor water ʢcontrolʣonce a day for 1 week, and liver and small intestine microsomes were prepared 1 day after the last treatment.

37 Effect of Polypodium Leucotomos  on CYP3Adose of PL extract used in the present study was based on a previous report investigating the antioxidant effect of PL extract against UVB/UV A in rats27ʣ.  The results of the present study suggest that PL extract also increases blood MDZ concentrations in vivo  by inhibiting CYP3A activity.  Recently, PL extract has attracted attention as a sunscreen supple ment and there are concerns about its coadministration with medicines.  Because CYP3A is involved in the metabolism of many drugs, precautions are needed to avoid the development of unexpected adverse effects, especially with medicines that have a narrow therapeutic range.ɹIn addition, mechanism-based inhibition ʢMBIʣis a known mechanism of CYP inhibition.  MBI is important clinically because the m etabolic intermediates metabolized by CYP are irreversibly bound, resulting in potent and sustained inhibition.  A typical example of MBI
occurs with GFJ, known to inactivate CYP3A irreversibly with an effect that lasts at least for 3 days12, 28ʣ.  Therefore, we conducted an in vitro  study including a preincubation step to investigate the possible occurrence of MBI with PL extract.  However, no fu rther inhibition of MDZ 1 `-OH was observed when PL extract was preincubated with human liver microsomes and NADPH before the addition of MDZ.  Therefore, we concluded that the mechanism by which PL extract inhibits CYP3A activity is direct rather than involving MBI.ɹPL extract may be ingested as a single treatment, but it is used for long periods for sun protection, especially in the summer season .  Therefore, it is important to investigate food-drug interactions via induction of CYP3A in addition to the inhibitory effects of PL extract.  For example, blood concentrations of simvastatin have been reported to be markedly decreased as a result of the induction of CYP3A by SJW
as a result of the induction of CYP3A by SJW13ʣ.  In such situations, cotreatment with this supplement should be avoided because it may decrease the efficacy of m edicines metabolized by this enzyme.  Our examination of the potential induction of CYP3A by a 1 -week of treatment of rats with PL extract showed no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of MDZ administered 24 h after the final PL administration compared with the control group.  In addition, there were no changes in either liver or small intestine CYP3A activity after 1 week treatment with PL extract, suggesting that PL extract did not induce CYP3A.  Meanwhile, in the 1 -week treatment study, because MDZ was administered 24 h after the last dose of PL extract, it seems that the components had already been eliminated and no inhibition of CYP3A was observed.  Further studies are needed to clarify the inhibitory effects of multiple doses of PL extract on CYP3A-mediated drug m etabolism.
extract on CYP3A-mediated drug m etabolism.ɹRecently, the self-medication concept has been expanding in Japan, and the use of herbal supplements has increased among the population.  However, knowledge and information regarding the safety of the combined use of herbal supplements and conventional medicines is considered insufficient.  Thus, the investigation of possible food-drug interactions is important for the safe and effectiv e use of herbal supplements, which is the motivation for the present study.  It is important to clarify whether the results of the present in vitro  and in vivo  rat experiments also occur in humans.  In addition, experiments are needed to provide similar information on other CYP isoforms, such as CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, which metabolize many important medicines used clinically.
Yurika G OMI, et al 38ɹIn conclusion, PL extract, which has recently drawn attention as a sunscreen supplement, inhibited CYP3A activity, indicating the possibility of increased blood concentrations of coadministered medicines that are metabolized by this enzyme.  In contrast, PL extract was shown to be less likely to cause drug interactions as a result of CYP3A induction.AcknowledgementsɹThis work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Sciences ʢJSPS ; KAKENHI Grant Number 16K07753 ʣ.Con/f_licts of InterestɹThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.References1ʣ Kohli I, Sha/f_i R, Isedeh P , et al.
