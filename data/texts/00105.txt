Possible Involvement of Basement Membrane Damage inSkin PhotoagingSatoshi Amano1Aging of sun-exposed skin is accelerated by threemajor environmental factors: UV radiation, dryness,and oxidation. UV radiation exposure is the mostinfluential factor in skin aging (so-called photoaging).To find ways to protect against damage caused by UVexposure and to delay photoaging, we studiedinternal changes of sun-exposed skin compared withthose of sun-protected skin. We found that thebasement membrane (BM) at the dermal–epidermaljunction (DEJ) of sun-exposed skin becomes damagedand multilayered and partly disrupted compared withthat of sun-protected skin. BM plays important rolesin maintaining a healthy epidermis and dermis, andrepeated damage destabilizes the skin, acceleratingthe aging process. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)and urinary plasminogen activator are increased inUV-irradiated skin. MMPs are detected in the corni-fied layer in sun-exposed skin, but not in sun-
protected skin. Using skin-equivalent models, wefound that MMPs and plasmin cause BM damageand that the reconstruction of BM is enhanced byinhibiting these proteinases, as well as by increasingthe synthesis of BM components. Enhancement of BMrepair mechanisms may be a useful strategy inretarding photoaging.Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings (2009) 14,2–7;doi:10.1038/jidsymp.2009.5INTRODUCTIONSkin aging can be classified into two types: intrinsic aging andphotoaging (Tagami, 2008). Intrinsic aging is a basicbiological process common to all living organisms, and it ischaracterized as an age-dependent deterioration of skinfunction and structure, such as epidermal atrophy anddermal–epidermal junctional (DEJ) flattening (Lavker, 1979).Photoaging is a well-known consequence of chronicexposure of skin to sunlight. Sun-exposed skin, such as onthe face or neck, appears ‘‘prematurely aged’’ in comparisonwith the relatively sun-protected skin of the trunk or thigh,
and it is characterized by several clinical features, includingwrinkling, laxity, roughness, sallowness, pigmentary change,telangiectasis, and neoplasia (Gilchrest, 1989; Griffiths,1992). The histological features of sun-exposed skin includecellular atypia, loss of polarity, flattening of the DEJ, adecrease in collagen, and dermal elastosis (Lavker, 1979;Kligman et al., 1986).The basement membrane (BM) at the DEJ has manyfunctions, of which the most obvious is to bind the epidermistightly to the dermis (Ryan et al., 1996). It also determinespolarity for the epidermis and provides a barrier againstepidermal migration. Once the BM is assembled, eachepidermal cell recognizes the surface adjacent to the BM asits basal surface. Stratification of the epidermis proceeds withthe proliferating cells remaining attached to the BM andthe daughter cells migrating into the upper layers (Watt,1984; Bohnert et al., 1986; Barrandon and Green, 1987). It is
thought that BM influences epidermal differentiation andmaintains the proliferative state of the basal layer. Undernormal circumstances, BM prevents the direct contact ofepidermal cells with the dermis.The BM may be divided into three morphological layers:lamina lucida, lamina densa, and lamina fibroreticularis(Inoue, 1989), as shown in Figure 1. Lamina densa is a sheet-like structure that is composed mainly of type IV collagen.Lamina lucida, a region between the lamina densa andepithelium, forms electron-dense plaques, hemidesmosomes,which consist mainly of a6b4 integrin and bullous pemphi-
which consist mainly of a6b4 integrin and bullous pemphi-goid antigen 2 (180 kDa). The BM contains unique structuresthat maintain attachment to the epidermis. Components ofthe attachment complex provide links to the intracellularintermediate filament network of basal keratinocytes and tothe extracellular matrix of the papillary dermis. One of thekey components of the anchoring complex is laminin 5(laminin 332). Earlier work has shown that laminin 332 isessential to epidermal attachment, as mutations in the genesencoding it underlie the severe blistering phenotype of theHerlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa (Aberdam et al .,1994). Laminin 332 is processed extracellularly to a matureform at the a3 and g2 chains by BMP-1 and other enzymesREVIEW2 Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings (2009), Volume 14 &2009 The Society for Investigative DermatologyReceived 14 November 2008; accepted 29 January 20091Shiseido Research Center, Yokohama, Japan

(Amano et al., 2000). It is clear that laminin 332 constitutesthe anchoring filaments and binds the transmembranehemidesmosomal integrin, a6b4, which is known to be itsreceptor. With respect to binding of laminin 332 with othercomponents of the BM or of the papillary dermis, it hasrecently been determined that (1) laminin 332 binds directlyto type VII collagen, to form the anchoring fibrils that insertinto the papillary dermis and (2) laminin 332 forms a covalentcomplex with laminin 311 or 321, and this laminin 332–311/321 complex interacts with type IV collagen in the BMthrough nidogen.The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependentendopeptidases involved in remodeling of the extracellularmatrix. They also play important roles in morphogenesis,angiogenesis, arthritis, skin ulcers, tumor invasion, andmetastases (Birkedal-Hansen, 1995). Five families of MMPshave been recognized: collagenases, gelatinases, stromely-
sins, matrilysins, and membrane-type MMPs. These enzymesare composed of several domains, including propeptide,catalytic, and hemopexin (except for matrilysin) domains.They are involved in the degradation of collagens, proteo-glycans, and various glycoproteins (Birkedal-Hansen, 1995).Among them, gelatinase A (MMP-2 or 72 kDa type IVcollagenase) and gelatinase B (MMP-9 or 92 kDa type IVcollagenase) digest type IV and VII collagens, whereasstromelysins (MMP-3, MMP-10) degrade laminins of the BM(Reynolds, 1996).Plasminogen activators (PAs)/plasmins represent one of themost potent and widely expressed systems for extracellularproteolysis (Saksela, 1985). PAs can be produced bymany cell types, including human epidermal keratinocytes(Morioka et al ., 1985), and they convert the widelydistributed zymogen, plasminogen, to plasmin, which de-grades most extracellular proteins either directly or byactivating other proteases (Morioka et al ., 1985; Marschall
et al., 1999). Tissue-type PA and urokinase-type PA (uPA) arethe products of distinct, but related, genes with differentpatterns of expression and regulation. Physiologically, tissue-type PA is predominantly responsible for fibrinolysis, whereasuPA seems to be involved in pericellular proteolysis bybinding to cell surfaces through a specific, high-affinity,glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored plasma membranereceptor (Plow et al ., 1986). Binding increases catalyticefficiency and targets the generation of plasmin to theimmediate pericellular space. In skin, uPA activity was foundto be present in the stratum corneum, as well as in thebasal layer after barrier disruption (Denda et al ., 1997;Katsuta et al ., 2003). The plasminogen/plasmin system inthe epidermis is thought to provide the major proteaseactivity involved in the delay of barrier recovery (Dendaet al., 1997).The first skin-equivalent model was developed in 1981 by
Bell et al. (1981), who plated human keratinocytes on top ofcontracted collagen gels containing dermal fibroblasts.

found to be useful for grafting wounds (Bell et al., 1981) orburned skin (Bell et al., 1981), to explore the dynamics of BM(Tsunenaga et al., 1998; Amano et al., 2001), and for studiesof epidermal differentiation, dermal–epidermal interaction,and tumor cell invasion (Tsunenaga et al., 1994; Nishiyamaet al., 2000; Amano et al., 2001).ULTRASTRUCTURAL ALTERATION OF EPIDERMAL BM INSUN-EXPOSED SKINAt the DEJ of sun-exposed skin, duplication of lamina densawas reported in aged adults (Lavker, 1979) and mouse(Feldman et al ., 1990), and these changes may result in amore fragile epidermal–dermal interface and in a weakerresistance of the epidermis to shearing forces in aged skin.
We observed that, even in the cheek (sun-exposed) skin of a30-year-old woman, severe disruption and reduplication oflamina densa were frequently observed beneath keratino-cytes, and that the anchoring fibrils were associated with adetached lamina densa, primarily on the dermal side(Figure 1). On the other hand, in young, sun-protected skin,such as the abdominal skin of a 34-year-old woman, scarcelyany alterations in the epidermal BM structure were apparent
at the DEJ (Figure 1b). In sun-exposed skin from the cheek of a60-year-old woman, the number of layers of reduplicatedlamina densa was increased, and the laminae densaebranched in various directions. In contrast, skin from theupper thigh of an 83-year-old woman showed very littledisruption or reduplication at the DEJ. However, after injurythat penetrates or disrupts the BM, epidermal cells losecontact with the BM and come into direct contact with thedermis. Under these conditions, epidermal cells modify theirbehavior to cover and close the wound. Such changesinclude the upregulation of proteolytic enzymes and theconversion to a migratory phenotype.INVOLVEMENT OF MMP IN DAMAGE TO EPIDERMALBM IN SUN-EXPOSED SKINMatrix metalloproteinases are thought to be involved inphotoaging, as MMPs-1, 2, 3, and 9 were found to beincreased by UV irradiation in experiments using humanfibroblasts (Herrmann et al ., 1993) and human skin (Fisher
et al ., 1996). In particular, Fisher et al . (1996) showedan increase in MMPs in human skin after exposure, evento an extremely low level of UVB, and they suggestedthat MMPs are UV-induced aging factors. In fact, gelatinaseactivities have been detected in the epidermis of fore-head skin by in situ gelatin zymography (Inomata et al .,2003). For further study, the skin equivalent was selected as amodel for BM damage, which partially mimics the photo-aging process because of a missing BM at the DEJ and thepresence of large amounts of MMPs (including gelatinasesMMP-2 and MMP-9) in the culture medium (Amano et al.,2001, 2005). An MMP inhibitor, CGS27023A, enhancedthe assembly of BM at the DEJ in the skin equivalent(Figure 2) (Amano et al ., 2001, 2005). This suggested thatMMPs play an important role in the degradation of BM and in
the induction of BM structural damage, including detachmentof the BM from basal keratinocytes and disruption ofthe lamina densa, which are observed in sun-exposed skin(Figure 1).Ki MMP-1:33 n MMMP-2: 20 n MMMP-3 :43 n M MMP-9:8 n MControl + MMP inhibitors (CGS27023A)CGS27023AKi MMP-1:33 n MMMP-2: 20 n MMMP-3 :43 n MMMP-9:8 n MNNCONHOHMeO SO2Figure 2 .Protective effects of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) inhibitorsagainst basement membrane (BM) damage at the dermal–epidermaljunction.

INVOLVEMENT OF PA/PLASMIN IN DAMAGE TO THEEPIDERMAL BM, DEGRADATION OF LAMININ 332,AND REDUCED ACTIVITIES OF LAMININ 332 INKERATINOCYTE ADHESION AND TYPE VII COLLAGENBINDINGUVB exposure increases the synthesis of uPA (Miralles et al.,1998; Marschall et al., 1999), as well as MMPs (Fisher et al.,1996). Both uPA activity and uPA are present in theconditioned medium of skin equivalents, and the additionof plasminogen enhances the degradation of BM componentsand impairs the assembly of BM at the DEJ, even in thepresence of an MMP inhibitor (Figure 3) (Ogura et al., 2008).Aprotinin, a plasmin inhibitor, restores the assembly of BM atthe DEJ when damaged by the addition of plasminogen(Figure 3).As the lamina densa may be detached at the anchoringfilaments from basal keratinocytes in sun-exposed skin(Figure 1), laminin 332, a major component of anchoringfilaments, is a candidate target of plasmin. As expected,plasmin degrades the a3 and b3 chains of laminin 332,
although the g2 chain is unaffected (Figure 4). Plasmincleaves both the amino and carboxy terminals of the a3chain, and these cleavages reduce the keratinocyte adhesionactivity of laminin 332 (Figure 5).

amino terminal fragment (domain VI) from the b3 chainby plasmin (Figure 4) results in a reduction in its affinityfor type VII collagen (Figure 5). Therefore, degradationof laminin 332 by plasmin may induce BM damage,such as the detachment of lamina densa from basalkeratinocytes.ENHANCED BM ASSEMBLY IN THE PRESENCEOF LAMININ 332 AND IN RESPONSE TOINCREASED SYNTHESIS OF BM COMPONENTS INA SKIN-EQUIVALENT MODELDamaged BM must be repaired, as it plays important rolesin maintaining a healthy epidermis and dermis. To findsubstances that stimulate the repair of damaged BM, weselected, for screening purposes, a skin-equivalent model,which is suitable for investigating the assembly of BMthrough cooperation between keratinocytes and fibroblasts.Purified laminin 332, a glycoprotein (MW: 410 kDa) com-posed of 165 kDa ( a3), 140 kDa ( b3), and 105 kDa ( g2)chains, enhances the formation of hemidesmosome-likestructures and BM at the DEJ in the skin equivalent.
Keratinocytes synthesize BM components, exceptnidogen. Fibroblasts also produce BM components otherthan laminin 332. We recently found that increasing theproduction of BM components, such as laminin 332, collagenIV, and collagen VII, in keratinocytes and/or fibroblastswith/without inhibitors of gelatinases and/or serine protei-nases is also effective in enhancing the repair and assemblyof BM.CONCLUSIONThe disruption and reduplication of BM at the DEJ in sun-exposed skin may be associated with increases in BM-damaging enzymes, such as plasmin and MMPs, whichdegrade the BM components (laminin 332, and type IV andVII collagens). The impairment of BM structure may beassociated with functional changes in epidermal and dermalcells, and consequently may facilitate the aging process bydamaging dermal extracellular matrices and inducing kera-tinocyte abnormality, as summarized in Figure 6. Laminin332 is able to enhance BM assembly (Tsunenaga et al., 1998).
Some cosmetic ingredients also promote BM repair byincreasing the synthesis of BM components, such as laminin332, and type IV and VII collagens, in the epidermis and/orthe dermis. Hence, BM represents a good target for skin-careproducts; components that enhance BM repair may improveepidermal–dermal communication and skin homeostasis,thereby strengthening defenses against ‘‘skin aging’’.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors state no conflict of interest.REFERENCESAberdam D, Galliano MF, Vailly J, Pulkkinen L, Bonifas J, Christiano AM et al.(1994) Herlitz’s junctional epidermolysis bullosa is linked to mutationsin the gene (LAMC2) for the gamma 2 subunit of nicein/kalinin(LAMININ-5).
