Cosmetics are not going to be a mere prosaic remedy for age and plainness. ”From: Max Beerbohm, A Defence of  Cosmetics  (1894).The condition of  the hair plays an important role in our physical appearance and self‑perception. The quantity, quality, and styling of  our hair define our gender, age, health, and social status.[1] There are no significant differences in the number of  hair follicles between men and women, or between the different races. Differences in the appearance of  hair are due to the type of  hair produced by the follicle and the type of  hair care practiced by the individual.[2]Conventionally, the medical focus has been either on hair loss or the condition of  the scalp in terms of specific dermatological conditions.

Indeed,	the	proximate	 structural	arrangement	of the scalp and hair leads to an interdependent relationship between the two.

In	fact,	there	is	a	wealth	of	observational	 data	on	specific	dermatological	 conditions	 of	the	scalp	providing	evidence for the role of the scalp condition in supporting the production of healthy hair. Oxidative	 stress,	the	inability	of	the	body	to	sufficiently	 counteract	 the	sources	of	oxidation,	is prevalent in many skin conditions, including normal skin aging. On the scalp, the hair appears to be impacted prior to emergence, and oxidative stress appears to play a role in premature hair loss.

Trüeb, et al.: Scalp condition and oxidative stressInternational Journal of Trichology / Volume 10 / Issue 6 / November-December 2018  263quality. Preemergent hair can be negatively impacted by the oxidative stress that occurs with an unhealthy scalp, possibly due to the incubatory environment, specifically the metabolic activity of  resident microbes. Therefore, hair care products with active agents that reduce the population of  respective microbes and restore a healthy scalp while reducing the associated oxidative stress may have an impact on hair health.THE SCALP IN HEALTH AND DISEASEThe scalp is the anatomical area bordered by the face at the front and by the neck at the sides and back. It is characterized by a usually high density of  terminal hair growth with numerous sebaceous glands that contribute to a specific microenvironment with significant differences from the rest of  the skin. The scalp is a rich environment for microbes.
Ecologically, sebaceous areas have greater species richness than dry ones, with implications both for skin physiology and pathologic conditions.[4] Specifically, dandruff  and seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and ultimately alopecia represent pathologic conditions, in which oxidative stress is very commonly detected.[5] Quantitation of  lipid peroxidation is a particularly prevalent method in dermatology to detect the underlying oxidative stress.[6‑8]Dandruff  and seborrheic dermatitisThe specific anatomic features of  the scalp skin, such as the large number of  terminal hair follicles and the enlarged epidermal surface due to numerous hair canals, contribute to a specific microenvironment of  the scalp and higher rate of  exfoliation. Even a normal scalp will develop some degree of  flaking within 1 or 2 weeks if  the hair is not washed, while pathological dandruff results from accelerated proliferation of  epidermal cells.
This leads to a breakdown of  the normal columnar structure of  the stratum corneum with increased exfoliation of  variously large collections of  abnormally keratinizing epidermal cells and formation of  cell aggregates, which determine the size of  the flakes. The process results from focal inflammation of  the scalp with parakeratosis which causes abnormal exfoliation and an altered light refractive index of  the keratinized cell aggregates.[9] The clinical appearance of  dandruff  is determined by the size, adherence, and light refractive characteristics of  the flakes. Among the factors that lead to inflamed patches on the scalp are microbial colonization with Malassezia  fungi, sebaceous lipids, and individual sensitivity.[10]Seborrheic dermatitis represents a chronic recurrent condition characterized by scaling and poorly defined erythematous patches, with a predilection for areas rich in sebaceous glands. In contrast to dandruff, in seborrheic
dermatitis, the redness and scaling frequently extend beyond the scalp to include the folds of  the nose and eyebrow areas. The cause of  seborrheic dermatitis is again understood to involve fungi of  the genus Malassezia .[10] Therefore, there seems to exist a pathogenic link with dandruff  that is understood to represent the mildest form of  the clinical presentation of  seborrheic dermatitis.The scalp microbiome consists primarily of  Propionibacteria , Staphylococcus bacteria, and Malassezia  yeast.[11] Malassezia  are responsible for essentially the entire scalp mycobiome. The inflammatory process is believed to be mediated by fungal metabolites, specifically free fatty acids released from sebaceous triglycerides. Both dandruff  and seborrheic dermatitis have clear signs of  oxidative stress as indicated by perturbed surface and systemic antioxidant enzyme levels.[12‑15] There have also been observations from surface
samples of  elevated lipid peroxidation accompanying dandruff  and seborrheic dermatitis.[16,17]Psoriasis
levels.[12‑15] There have also been observations from surface samples of  elevated lipid peroxidation accompanying dandruff  and seborrheic dermatitis.[16,17]PsoriasisPsoriasis is a chronic inflammatory condition of  the scalp, and the most thoroughly studied skin condition linking oxidative stress, the role of  Malassezia  spp., and risk of  hair loss. In contrast to seborrheic dermatitis, the condition is characterized by sharply demarcated erythematosquamous lesions with silver‑white scaling. The most dramatic expression of  the immune‑mediated condition is tumor necrosis factor‑alpha inhibition – treatment‑induced psoriasiform dermatitis of  the scalp with the risk of permanent alopecia from scarring.[18‑20] Overgrowth of the scalp with Malassezia  spp. is again a well‑known feature of  scalp psoriasis.[21] Indicators of  oxidative stress in psoriasis include altered antioxidant enzymes,[22] oxidized proteins,[23,24] as well as oxidized lipids.[25]
proteins,[23,24] as well as oxidized lipids.[25]Atopic dermatitisAtopic dermatitis is yet another common, chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disorder that may affect the scalp in a significant manner. Its pathogenesis is complex and involves genetics, environmental factors, disrupted permeability of  the skin, and immunologic mechanisms. A subset of  patients with head‑and‑neck dermatitis may have a reaction to resident Malassezia  flora exacerbating their condition.[26‑31] This reaction is likely related to both humoral‑  and cell‑mediated immunity.

Aging represents the accumulation of  changes over time, involving both programmed factors and damage‑related
factors  (nonprogrammed factors). Programmed factors follow a biological timetable, perhaps a continuation of  the one that regulates childhood growth and development. This regulation would depend on changes in gene expression that affect the systems responsible for maintenance, repair, and defense responses. Damage‑related factors include internal and environmental assaults that induce cumulative damage at various levels.Aging of  the hair itself  affects hair color (graying), hair production (alopecia), and structural properties of  the hair fiber (hair diameter, hair fiber curvature, stretching, bending, and torsional rigidity of  the hair fiber, and lipid composition), with its consequence for the manageability and overall appearance of  hair.[37]In contrast, the aging effects on nonbalding scalp are relatively unnoticed. Underneath the hair, the scalp may appear pale and dry, with a certain degree of  laxity. In
contrast, balding scalp exhibits the features of  photo‑aged skin, including irregular pigmentation, wrinkling, atrophy, telangiectasia, and findings of  cutaneous premalignant and malignant diseases, such as actinic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Onset of  solar elastosis of  the scalp precedes the onset of  hair loss in androgenetic alopecia,[38] providing the evidence that scalp hair does not completely protect from the effects of  UVR and the need for added scalp UVR protection. Other aging features seen in the sun‑damaged scalp include variability in thickness and cellularity in epidermis, unevenly distributed melanocytes, and increased inflammatory cells in the dermis. Due to the decrease in volume and elasticity, the skin becomes thinner and more easily damaged. Moreover, aging skin receives less blood flow and exhibits lower glandular activity. The net result of  these effects is the
decreasing ability of  skin to heal itself, with an increase of  skin pathologies.Remarkably, aging does not appear to follow a perfectly regular course over time. Periods of  stability, or even partial remission, alternated with periods of  more marked evolution, reflecting perhaps the influence of  individual factors such as the individual’s general health and nutritional status, life style and hygiene, and risk factors for accelerated aging.ROLE OF OXIDATIVE STRESS IN SCALP HEALTH AND AGINGExperimental evidence supports the hypothesis that oxidative stress plays a major role in the aging process. In 1956, Harman[39] originally proposed the free radical theory of  aging. Free radicals are highly reactive molecules with unpaired electrons that can directly damage various cellular structural membranes, lipids, proteins, and DNA. The damaging effects of  these reactive oxygen species are induced internally during normal metabolism and externally
through exposure to various oxidative stresses from the environment. While the body possesses endogenous defense
induced internally during normal metabolism and externally through exposure to various oxidative stresses from the environment. While the body possesses endogenous defense mechanisms, such as anti‑oxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) and nonenzymatic anti‑oxidative molecules  (Vitamin E, Vitamin C, glutathione, and ubiquinone), to protect it from free radicals by reducing and neutralizing them, with age, the production of  free radicals increases, while the endogenous defense mechanisms decrease. This imbalance leads to the progressive damage of  cellular structures, presumably resulting in the aging phenotype.Nishimura (oral communication, 7th World Congress for Hair Research, May 4–6, 2013, Edinburgh, Scotland) found hair follicles to age through defective renewal of  hair follicle stem cells much in the manner as maintenance of  melanocyte stem cells becomes incomplete with aging.[40]
Hair production and pigmentation is fueled by stem cells, which transition between cyclical bouts of  rest and activity. Aged hair follicle stem cells exhibit enhanced resting and abbreviated growth phases and are delayed in response to tissue‑regenerating cues. Ultimately, aged hair follicle stem cells are poor at initiating proliferation and show diminished self‑renewing capacity upon extensive use. Aging‑related loss of  hair follicle stem cell marker expression starts well before hair follicles have shortened.

Trüeb, et al.: Scalp condition and oxidative stressInternational Journal of Trichology / Volume 10 / Issue 6 / November-December 2018  265as models, Nishimura proposed an accumulation of  DNA damage to be involved in the aging process.Concept of  the pre‑ and post‑emergent hair fiberConventionally, the study of  hair aging has focused on two main streams of  attention: on the one hand, the esthetic problem of  aging hair and its management, in other words everything that happens outside the skin, and on the other hand, the biological problem of  hair aging, in terms of  microscopic, biochemical, and molecular changes within the follicle in the depth of  the scalp.The condition of  the hair fiber must be viewed as the result of  a combination of  preemergent and of postemergent factors.[41] Sources of  oxidative stress with impact on the preemergent fiber include oxidative metabolism; smoking;[42,43] UVR;[44] inflammation from
microbial, pollutant, or irritant origins; and oxidized scalp lipids. Sources of  oxidative stress with impact on the postemergent fiber include again UVR, and chemical insults from oxidizing hair colorants and pollutants [ Figure  1].[41]While age‑dependent thinning of  hair is understood to be genetically determined and linked to peculiarities of  hormone metabolism, it is primarily treated with the respective hair growth‑promoting agent minoxidil and the 5‑alpha‑reductase inhibitors finasteride or dutasteride. Nevertheless, their limited success rate means that further pathogenic pathways must be taken into account.[45] Specifically, Bahta et al.[46] originally demonstrated that cultured dermal papilla cells (DPCs) from balding scalp grow slower  in vitro than nonbalding DPCs. Loss of  proliferative capacity of  balding DPCs was associated with changes in cell morphology, expression of  senescence‑associated markers, decreased
expression of  proliferating cell markers, and upregulation of  markers of  oxidative stress and DNA damage. The finding of  premature senescence of  balding DPCs in association with the expression of  markers of  oxidative stress and DNA damage suggests that balding DPCs are particularly sensitive to environmental stress. As one of  the major triggers of  senescence  in vitro stems from oxidative stress, Upton et al.[47] further investigated the effects of  oxidative stress on balding and occipital scalp DPCs. Patient‑matched DPCs from balding and occipital scalp were cultured at atmospheric  (21%) or physiologically normal (2%) O2. At 21% O2, DPCs showed flattened morphology and a significant reduction in mobility, population doubling, increased levels of  reactive oxygen species and senescence‑associated β‑Gal activity, and increased expression of  p16 (INK4a) and pRB. Balding DPCs secreted higher levels of  the negative hair
growth regulators such as transforming growth factor beta 1 and 2 in response to H2O2 but not cell culture‑associated oxidative stress. These  in vitro findings suggest a role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of  androgenetic alopecia both in relation to cell senescence and migration, and also to secretion of  known hair follicle inhibitory factors. Finally, stress‑induced premature senescence of  DPCs compromise hair follicle epithelial–mesenchymal interaction underlying hair cycling.[48]Studies have demonstrated oxidative stress associated with alopecia.[49‑54] The measures are similar to those in other skin conditions: antioxidant enzymes, protein oxidation, and lipid oxidation. The most common manifestation of  the oxidative stress is lipid oxidation, and therefore quantitation of  lipid peroxidation is a particularly prevalent method in dermatologic research.[7] The oxidized lipids are now understood to negatively influence the normal
growth of  hair: Naito et al.[55] analyzed the effect of  the lipid peroxides on hair follicles and observed that the

Furthermore, they found that lipid peroxides induced apoptosis of  hair follicle cells. They also induced apoptosis in human epidermal keratinocytes by upregulating apoptosis‑related genes. These results indicate that lipid peroxides, which can cause free radicals, induce the apoptosis of  hair follicle cells, and this is followed by early onset of  the catagen phase.Ultimately, in the context of  scalp condition and its impact on the preemergent hair and aging, Malassezia  is a proven source of  oxidative stress,[56,57] with a correlation between Malassezia presence and the degree of  oxidative stress.[58,59]An unhealthy scalp leads to unhealthy hairThere is ample evidence from data involving collections and characterization of  hair samples from various unhealthy
scalp conditions to help establish a link between scalp health and hair growth and quality.[17,60‑73] Most of  the published data are epidemiological in nature comparing hair obtained from individuals with dandruff  or seborrheic dermatitis,[17,60‑65] atopic dermatitis,[61,66] and psoriasis[67‑73] with that from a control group of  healthy scalp individuals. The results are summarized in Table  1.As can be seen from the summary of  scalp abnormalities, the most common manifestation to hair emerged from an unhealthy scalp is an altered cuticle with evidence of  surface pitting, roughness, cuticle rigidity, or breakage. In some cases, the impact is manifested as shine reduction. In addition to the physical changes, there are biochemical alterations observed in hair emerged from an unhealthy scalp, with both protein and lipid components affected, most commonly by oxidative damage.[17,61,66,67]Finally, a number of  observations have found that
premature hair loss may be caused by the poor scalp health associated with either dandruff  and seborrheic dermatitis,[62‑64] or psoriasis,[68,69] indicating that the effect on the preemergent hair fiber may alter the anchoring force of  the fiber with the follicle, as evidenced by an increased proportion both of  catagen and telogen,[74,75] and of dysplastic anagen hairs (anagen hairs devoid of  hair root sheaths)[75,76] in the trichogram (hair pluck).THE EFFECT OF SCALP CARE ON HAIR GROWTH AND QUALITYUntil the introduction of  the first nonalkaline shampoos in 1933, soap was the only available cleanser for the hair and scalp.[77] Today, shampoos are expected to be more than mere cleansing agents. They are expected to improve the hair cosmetically while being tailored to the needs of  various hair types, age, and scalp condition. Finally, with respect to product comfort, shampoos are expected to not dry out the hair, to produce lather in hard and soft water
and, when applied to oily hair, to be nonirritating to skin and mucous membranes, to be chemically and physically stable, to be biodegradable, and affordable. Accordingly, shampoos have evolved into high‑tech products consisting of  ten to thirty ingredients that are combined in precise formulations to meet consumer demands.[78]Ultimately, shampoo treatments are the most commonly used means of  managing hair and scalp conditions and have proven to be effective for the treatment of  dandruff  and seborrheic dermatitis,[79‑83] psoriasis,[84] and atopic dermatitis of  the head‑and‑neck type.[85,86] Today, it is understood that scalp care products for dandruff  and seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis exert their benefits by controlling scalp Malassezia  levels.Given the observations on the role of  oxidative stress in premature hair loss and the part that Malassezia  spp. play in generating oxidative stress, it is likely that products
with Malassezia  control active would exert some hair loss prevention benefits.
in generating oxidative stress, it is likely that products with Malassezia  control active would exert some hair loss prevention benefits.Originally, Piérard et al.[87] hypothesized on a microbial‑driven inflammatory reaction abutting on the hair follicles and performed a pilot study with twenty males using an 0.25% octopirox leave‑on product and demonstrated that the product improved the semi‑quantitative self‑assessment of  hair loss over a 1.5‑year treatment period. Subsequently, Piérard‑Franchimont et al.[88] conducted a study to compare the effect of  2% ketoconazole shampoo to that of  an unmedicated shampoo used in combination with or without 2% minoxidil therapy for male androgenetic alopecia and found that hair density and size and proportion of  anagen follicles were improved almost similarly by both ketoconazole and minoxidil regimens, even in the absence of  dandruff. The authors concluded that there may be a
significant action of  ketoconazole upon the course of androgenetic alopecia and that Malassezia spp. play a role in the inflammatory reaction.Value of  zinc pyrithione‑based shampoo for normal hair growth and retentionFollowing the original studies of  Piérard et al. and Piérard‑Franchimont et al.,[87,88] Berger et al.[89] performed a 6‑month, randomized, investigator‑blinded, parallel‑group clinical study to assess the hair growth benefits of  a 1% zinc pyrithione  (ZPT)‑based shampoo (Head & Shoulders®, Downloaded from http://journals.lww.com/ijot by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4XMi0hCywCX1AWnYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC4/OAVpDDa8K2+Ya6H515kE= on 09/26/2024

The efficacy of  the 1% ZPT‑based shampoo (used daily) was compared with that of  5% minoxidil topical solution (applied twice daily), a placebo shampoo, and a combination of  the 1% ZPT‑based shampoo and the 5% minoxidil topical solution. Hair count results showed a significant net increase in total visible hair counts for the 1% ZPT shampoo, the 5% minoxidil topical solution, and the combination treatment groups relative to the placebo shampoo after 9 weeks of  treatment. Finally, a placebo‑controlled treatment study with a ZPT‑based shampoo (Head & Shoulders®) was published demonstrating decreased oxidative stress in both scalp and preemergent hair for the ZPT leg. This
provides support for the underlying mechanisms for hair loss reduction observations for the ZPT‑based shampoo as well as other Malassezia ‑inhibiting shampoo actives.[17]Table 1: Observed impacts to hair in relation to scalp pathologiesDownloaded from http://journals.lww.com/ijot by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4XMi0hCywCX1AWnYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC4/OAVpDDa8K2+Ya6H515kE= on 09/26/2024
Trüeb, et al.: Scalp condition and oxidative stress268 International Journal of Trichology / Volume 10 / Issue 6 / November-December 2018SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSThe science of  hair care not only addresses the esthetic problem of  the condition of  the hair fiber in terms of  hair quality and color, but also the underlying biological problem of  hair aging and pathologies. While the role of  oxidative stress has been widely discussed in relation to the skin and aging, in comparison, little focus has been placed on its role in impacting scalp health, hair growth, and condition. There is a wealth of  observational data on specific dermatological conditions, such as dandruff  and seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis, providing the evidence for the role of  a healthy scalp in supporting the production of  healthy hair. Oxidative stress, the inability of  the body to sufficiently counteract sources of  oxidative damage, is
prevalent in all of  these skin conditions, just as in normal skin aging. On the scalp, the hair appears to be impacted prior to emergence, and oxidative stress appears to play a role in premature hair loss. The scalp commensal organism, Malassezia , has been recognized to be a source of  oxidative damage. Therefore, hair care products with active agents that reduce the population of  Malassezia  tend to reduce premature hair loss [ Figure  2]. Since Malassezia  is a source of  oxidative stress, its presence, even in individuals not showing symptoms of  scalp pathologies, likely enhances subclinical stress that could contribute to compromised hair quality and growth. Besides its known benefits in treating scalp pathologies, such as dandruff  and seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis of  the scalp, a ZPT‑based shampoo (Head & Shoulders) has demonstrated reduction in hair loss by several assessment methods, even in the absence of  scalp pathologies.
Considering the relationship between oxidative stress, Malassezia spp., and hair aging, it is therefore conceivable that regular use may contribute to hair loss prevention.Declaration of  patient consentThe authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.
