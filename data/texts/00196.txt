skin, deﬁning a healthy diet and the role of diet in aging. The topic that currently attracts maximumattention is ways to maintain healthy skin and delay skin aging. Skin is the primary barrier thatprotects the body from external aggressions. Skin aging is a complex biological process, categorized aschronological aging and photo-aging, and is a ﬀected by internal factors and external factors. With therapid breakthrough of medicine in prolonging human life and the rapid deterioration of environmentalconditions, it has become urgent to ﬁnd safe and e ﬀective methods to treat skin aging. For diet, as themain way for the body to obtain energy and nutrients, people have gradually realized its importanceto the skin. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the skin structure, aging manifestations, and possiblemechanisms, summarize the research progress, challenges, possible directions of diet management,
and e ﬀects of foodborne antioxidants on skin aging from the perspective of food and nutrition.Keywords: diet; skin aging; nutritional level; eating habits; foodborne antioxidants; anti-aging1. IntroductionSkin is the organ with the largest contact area between the human body and the externalenvironment and is a barrier that separates the human body from the environment. It not only protectsthe body from external environmental damage and avoids water loss from the body, but also has acertain cosmetic e ﬀect [1]. The aging of organs occurs throughout our life. As the largest organ of thehuman body, the skin shows obvious signs of aging due to age, ultraviolet radiations (UVR) exposure,and chemical pollution. With the development of science and technology and improvement in humanliving standards, people pay more attention to skin aging and try to have a better understanding ofit. Many people, especially women, spend a signiﬁcant portion of their daily expenses on cosmetics
and medicines for the treatment and prevention of skin aging. This huge demand continues to driveresearch into the prevention and treatment of skin aging [2].Animal skin is composed of three layers, including epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue [ 3](Figure 1). During development, skin epidermal cells rapidly di ﬀerentiate into four layers of stratumcorneum, granular layer, spinous layer, and the basal layer. Stem cells (SC) and transient ampliﬁcationcells (TA) located at the base layer promote the regeneration of human skin epidermis. Epidermalregeneration and SC behavior are regulated by external signaling pathways such as the Wnt signalingpathway [ 4,5]. Dermis refers to the part above the subcutaneous fat below the epidermis, which is theconnective tissue composed of ﬁbroblasts, responsible for the synthesis and secretion of collagen andNutrients 2020 ,12, 870; doi:10.3390 /nu12030870 www.mdpi.com /journal /nutrients
Nutrients 2020 ,12, 870 2 of 25other matrix proteins (such as ﬁbronectin, elastin, and glycans) to the extracellular environment, givingthe skin elasticity, strength, and ability to resist external interference [ 6,7]. Fibroblasts are also involvedin skin aging [ 8], carcinogenesis [ 9], wound healing [ 10], ﬁbrosis [ 11], and other pathological processes.Subcutaneous layer refers to the fat layer immediately below the dermis layer, which surrounds thehair follicles and plays a major role in connecting the skin with muscles and bones, storing energy,secreting hormones, and keeping warm. Subcutaneous adipose tissue is also involved in regulatingthe speed of hair regeneration, balancing the internal environment of the skin, and promoting skinrepair after damage and infection [12,13].Aging refers to the body’s ability to adapt to the environment’s physiology and psychology, whichprogressively decreases and gradually leads to death. It is mainly characterized by the accumulation
of macromolecular damage, impaired tissue renewal, gradual loss of physiological function integrity,and increased risk of death [ 14]. Aging is caused by a combination of internal factors (such as hormonelevels, genotypes, endocrine metabolism, etc.), and external factors (such as ultraviolet radiation,nutritional levels, chemical pollution, etc.). Skin aging can be divided into chronological aging andphoto-aging (or internal aging and external aging). As the name suggests, the chronological aging ofthe skin occurs throughout the body, and photo-aging occurs on the body’s light-exposed sites [ 15,16].Chronological aging caused by internal factors occurs naturally and is not easy to change, but it ispossible to delay photo-aging by altering external factors [ 17]. Reasonable diet and balanced nutritionare important measures to delay aging and prolong life. Therefore, in this review, we brieﬂy introduce
the composition of the skin, internal and external changes that occur during skin aging, and themolecular mechanism, focus on the perspective of food nutrition, and review the recent progressin research on diet management, nutrition regulation, and foodborne antioxidants in inducing anddelaying skin aging. We hope that our views will enrich the reader’s understanding of diet to improveskin aging and also provide a basis for subsequent research.Figure 1. (a) Schematic diagram of skin structure, ( b) Schematic diagram of skin structure after aging.This picture is a comparison of the changes between young skin and aging skin.2. Changes and Molecular Mechanisms in Skin Aging2.1. Apparent Changes in Skin AgingAging is characterized by the accumulation of macromolecular damage within cells, impairedability of stem cells to promote tissue regeneration, and restore the loss of physiological integrity [ 7].
Chronological aging and photo-aging are two processes of skin aging that although related, havediﬀerent clinical manifestations and pathogenesis (Figure 2). Chronological aging usually appearsafter a certain age and is a ﬀected by factors such as ethnicity, individual, and skin site. It is mainly
Nutrients 2020 ,12, 870 3 of 25characterized by dry skin, dullness, lack of elasticity, and ﬁne wrinkles [ 18]. Histological features includeepidermal atrophy, reduction in the number of dermal ﬁbroblasts and collagen ﬁbers, slackening,thinness, and even function disorganized. The primary causes are: ﬁrst, the SC dysfunction inkeratinocytes, decreased regenerative ability of stem cells in the basal layer of the epidermis leadingto a decline in skin renewal and repair ability, ultimately causing aging [ 19], and second, due tothe accumulation of damage and aging skin dysfunction, ﬁbroblasts lose the ability to reshape theextracellular matrix or have a reduced ability to synthesize and secrete collagen or viscous proteins.Third, aging ﬁbroblasts alter intracellular homeostasis through certain paracrine mechanisms [20,21].Figure 2. Comparison of chronological aging and photo-aging of the skin. In the ﬁgure, " ↑" means "rise
or increase"; "↓" means "fall or decrease"; DNA =deoxyribonucleic acid; ECM =extracellular matrix;UVRs =ultraviolet radiations; ROS =reactive oxygen species; MMPs =Matrix metalloproteinases;HA=Hyaluronic acid.Photo-aging is caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet radiation, mainly manifested as skinwrinkles, relaxation, roughness, yellowish or grayish-yellow, capillary expansion, and pigmented spotformation, etc. [ 16,19]. The photo-aging site is a ﬀected by the wavelength of ultraviolet light, which canbe divided into A, B, C categories depending on the length of the wavelength. UV-A (320–400 nm) haslow energy but strong penetrating power, which mainly a ﬀects the dermis of the skin. It accelerates thehydrolysis of skin collagen by promoting the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), leadingto tissue destruction and progressive degeneration of dermal extracellular matrix [ 22–24]. UV-A also
inhibits the synthesis of hyaluronic acid (HA) by down-regulating the synthesis of hyaluronic acidsynthase, thereby changing the composition of skin proteoglycans [ 20]. UV-B acts on keratinocytes inthe skin epithelial layer, potentially induces DNA damage and mutation in keratinocytes, stimulatesthe release of soluble cytokines from keratinocytes, and causes skin cells to show symptoms such asaging, inﬂammation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis [ 25,26]. However, keratinocytes have a strongantioxidant capacity in response to UV-B exposure, are more resistant than ﬁbroblasts to the lethaleﬀects of oxidants, and are more sensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced apoptosis [ 27].Further, aging skin ﬁbroblasts cause pigmentation and dark spots by promoting the transcription ofthe melanin gene [28].
Nutrients 2020 ,12, 870 4 of 252.2. Molecular Mechanism of Skin AgingResearchers have used many models in recent years to explain the molecular mechanism ofskin aging and the mechanism of its alleviation. These models include cell aging, oxidative stress,high-frequency chromosomal abnormalities, single-gene mutations, and chronic inﬂammation [ 29].We summarize here the progress in recent years on the research on the molecular mechanism of skinaging, as fellows.a. Oxidative stress. Oxidative stress plays an important role in skin aging and skin damageprocesses, and its main feature is increased intracellular ROS. The skin’s oxidative metabolismand UV exposure lead to the production of ROS. The accumulation of ROS causes DNA damage,induces skin inﬂammatory response, reduces antioxidant enzymes, activates nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kB) and activator protein1 (AP–1) to inhibit collagen production, and increases matrix
metalloproteinases to decompose collagen and binding proteins in the dermis, which eventuallyleads to skin aging [30–33].b. DNA damage and gene mutation. Earlier studies reviewed the mechanisms of UV-induced DNAdamage and classiﬁed them into direct damage and indirect damage. Direct damage occurs whenDNA absorbs the UV-B photon, leading to rearrangement in the nucleotide sequence, resulting inDNA strand deletion or mutation. During indirect damage, DNA molecules absorb UV-A andpromote electron and energy transfer to oxygen molecules to form free radicals’ singlet oxygenions, causing DNA damage [ 34,35]. DNA damage can be repaired by photolytic enzymes, whileUV-induced skin DNA damage can be prevented by applying sunscreen [36,37].c. Shortening of the telomere. Telomeres are a small piece of DNA-protein complex at the endtips of eukaryotic linear chromosomes, which are important components in maintaining the
chromosomal integrity and controlling the cell cycle. A telomere is shortened with cell divisionand is associated closely with cell division and senescence [ 38,39]. Telomerase is an enzymeresponsible for telomere elongation, and its synthesis is essential for telomere maintenance andlong-term survival of the organism. Epithelial stem cells with short telomeres have a poorproliferative capacity, which can be corrected by introducing telomerase. The reactive oxygengenerated by UV radiation induces telomere mutation, cell death, or senescence. Nevertheless,some studies opine that the relationship between telomeres and aging may be speculation and,therefore, this relationship needs to be demonstrated [38–42].d. The role of microRNA. miRNAs are a type of conserved non-coding RNA. Chronic UV-B altersthe expression of mir–34 family proteins in the skin. MiR–34 in human dermal ﬁbroblast (HDFs)
cells regulates cell function and expression of MMP–1, α1 type1 collagen (COL1A1), and elastin.miRNA 378b inhibits mRNA expression of COL1A1 by interfering with Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) inHDFs, miRNA 217 regulates the senescence of human skin ﬁbroblast by directly targeting DNAmethyltransferase 1, and miR–23a–3p controls cellular senescence by targeting enzymes to controlhyaluronic acid synthesis. These studies thus show that microRNAs regulate the skin agingprocess [43–47].e. Accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs are the products of excess sugarand protein binding, usually derived from body synthesis and food intake. The nonenzymaticglycosylation aging theory has been widely recognized by many scholars. As the ﬁnal productof nonenzymatic glycosylation reaction, AGEs accumulate in photo-aging skin, a ﬀect proteinfunction in the dermis, and promote skin aging [48–50].f. Aging due to inﬂammation. Continuous UV radiation exposure induces oxidative stress in
epidermal cells, causing cell damage, fat oxidation, and ﬁnally leads to cell inﬂammation.When the degree of inﬂammation exceeds the ability of macrophages to clear up, macrophages
epidermal cells, causing cell damage, fat oxidation, and ﬁnally leads to cell inﬂammation.When the degree of inﬂammation exceeds the ability of macrophages to clear up, macrophagesalso begin secreting pro-inﬂammatory factors and ROS to accelerate dermal inﬂammation andinjury [ 51,52]. With the continuous advancement in dermatology in the past two decades,methods such as stem cell transplantation, hormone therapy, telomerase modiﬁcation, and use
Nutrients 2020 ,12, 870 5 of 25of antioxidants and retinoic acid have been promoted to address skin aging. However, someof these treatment methods have certain disadvantages and serious side e ﬀects. For example,hormone therapy increases the risk of breast cancer, retinoic acid may cause osteoporosis, andtelomerase modiﬁcation increases the risk of skin cancer. Therefore, improving skin conditionthrough diet management is being increasingly accepted by people.3. Diet Management and Skin AgingFood is the foundation of our lives, and diet is the main way for the body to obtain the requiredsubstances for growth and maintenance. Human beings group themselves into di ﬀerent ethnicity,religions, nationalities, and catering cultures. More than 2000 years ago, the Chinese medical book"Yellow Emperors Internal Classic. Su Wen" contained a balanced diet principle of "ﬁve grains fornutrition, ﬁve fruits for help, ﬁve animals for beneﬁt, and ﬁve vegetables for ﬁlling", and the folk also
includes "what to eat and what to add". Modern science has proven that an imbalance in nutrition andpoor eating habits are important causes of skin aging. The e ﬀect of nutrients and dietary habits on skinaging is mentioned in Table 1.3.1. Nutrition LevelNutrition is closely associated with skin health and is required for all biological processes ofskin from youth to aging or disease. Nutrition levels and eating habits can repair damaged skinand can also cause damage to the skin. In recent years, a number of people have closely linkedhealth-nutrition-eating habits and skin health, besides, clinical research and epidemiology havesuccessfully combined nutrition with tissues and organ health and have conﬁrmed that nutritionallevels and eating habits have a certain degree of impact on skin health and aging.Water is a vital constituent of the body and facilitates maintenance of balance and tissue function
in the body. Water in the body and cells mainly serves the role of nutrient, solvent, transportationcarrier, maintains body volume, and regulates body temperature [ 53–55]. Lack of water in the bodycan cause tissue dehydration and functional disorders (such as aging and inﬂammation). Skin is noexception, and the appearance of the skin on lips and limb is a direct reﬂection of the body’s moisturestatus. So how much water every day is good for the skin? Studies show that it is better to have morewater and drinking more than 2 L of water per day signiﬁcantly a ﬀects skin physiology and promotessuperﬁcial and deep hydration of the skin. However, the e ﬀects of water on the skin may be di ﬀerentfrom that of the water intake, and these e ﬀects are obvious in people who drink less water [56,57].Trace elements include iron, iodine, zinc, and copper, etc., and refer to elements whose contentin the human body is less than 0.01–0.005% of the body mass. Despite being less abundant in the
body, trace elements have strong physiological and biochemical e ﬀects [ 58]. Trace elements are closelyrelated to skin immunity and inﬂammation, and the homeostasis of copper and zinc ions in psoriasispatients may be a potential target for treating psoriasis [ 59]. Zinc content in the skin ranks thirdamong all tissues and is an essential element for the proliferation and di ﬀerentiation of skin epidermalkeratinocytes [ 60,61]. Bauer et al. [ 62] demonstrated that enhanced dietary zinc-rich amino acidcomplexes may a ﬀect the proliferation of goat horn and interphalangeal skin keratinocytes. However,the role of trace zinc or amino acid has not been further clariﬁed. In the skin, copper is involvedin the extracellular matrix formation, synthesis and stabilization of skin proteins, and angiogenesis.Clinical studies have shown that copper aids in improving skin elasticity, reducing facial ﬁne lines
and wrinkles, and promoting wound healing [ 63]. Iron is a catalyst for bio-oxidation. Studies have
and wrinkles, and promoting wound healing [ 63]. Iron is a catalyst for bio-oxidation. Studies haveshown that ultraviolet radiation and iron content in women’s post-menopausal skin cells increaserapidly, reduce the skin’s antioxidant capacity, and lead to aging [ 64,65]. The lack of selenium in thediet weakens the UV-B-induced antioxidative ability of mice skin, making the skin more sensitive tooxidative stress due to ultraviolet radiation [ 66]. Se-enriched proteins are also essential in keratinocytedevelopment and function [ 67]. There are some studies on the lack of other trace elements and theireﬀects on the skin, as well as in vitro experiments of trace elements, which are not described here.
Nutrients 2020 ,12, 870 6 of 25Vitamin deﬁciency a ﬀects skin health. The lack of vitamins in the body can cause skin disorders.For example, lack of vitamin C causes the symptoms of scurvy such as fragile skin and impaired woundhealing. Vitamins, as skin antioxidant defense ingredients, are mostly taken from food, so the content ofvitamins in the diet is closely related to skin antioxidant capacity and physiological functions [ 68–70].Proteins form an important part of body tissues and organs. Their primary physiological functionsare to construct and repair tissues, mediate physiological functions, and supply energy. All tissue cellsin the body are constantly renewed, and only adequate protein intake can maintain normal tissuerenewal and repair. Skin is no exception, and the skin renewal cycle is generally considered to be 28 days.Protein deﬁciency or excessive intake can cause metabolic disorders and a ﬀect physical health [ 71].
Excessive intake of plant protein increases kidney load, and excess animal protein intake increases therisk of osteoporosis [ 72,73]. Conversely, protein deﬁciency causes a series of diseases such as reducedresistance, slow growth, weight loss, apathy, irritability, anemia, thinness, and edema. Countriesaround the world recommend standard protein intakes based on age, sex, work, and physiologicalperiod. Studies have shown that ingesting su ﬃcient protein can help in healing pressure ulcers inrats, while both excess and inadequate protein intake are detrimental to ulcer healing. Dietary proteinsupplementation can also enhance cellular protein synthesis and metabolism [ 74]. The e ﬀects of dietaryprotein and its hydrolyzed peptides improving skin aging have been described in detail in Section 4.1of this paper. There may be some other nutrients that have not been discussed in this article but a ﬀectthe skin aging and needs to be continuously supplemented.3.2. Eating Habits
3.2. Eating HabitsDietary habits refer to the preference for food or drink, are an important part of the dietary cultureand inﬂuenced by regional, historical, cultural, product, and other factors. Although the incidenceof vitamin, trace elements, and protein deﬁciencies in developed western countries are very low,imbalanced or incomplete diet can also lead to diseases and aging, thereby a ﬀecting skin health. Datafrom epidemiological and experimental studies suggest an important role of diet and dietary patternsin the pathogenesis of many age-related diseases [75].Tobacco use is one of the major public health hazards in the world. Millions of people worldwidedie each year due to smoking, so tobacco is also called a "poisonous weed". Smoking can change skincuticle thickness and accelerates skin pigmentation. The thickness of the stratum corneum correlatespositively with pigmentation and negatively with years of smoking, and this skin pigmentation is
more obvious in the upper lip than in the gums [ 76,77]. Some clinical observations and investigationshave also shown a certain correlation between smoking, external aging, and facial skin aging [ 78,79].Further, after cosmetic surgery, smoking can cause complications such as postoperative infections,delayed wound healing, and skin necrosis [ 80]. While we cannot conclude completely on the harmfuleﬀect of alcohol on the body, alcohol and acetone produced by alcohol metabolism can promote theproliferation of skin keratinocytes, thereby enhancing skin permeability and damaging its barrierfunction. Alcohol also a ﬀects the metabolism of triglycerides and cholesterol and a ﬀects the lipidcomposition of the skin [ 81,82]. Studies by Goodman et al. [ 83] revealed that aging causes changesin facial skin and volume and is closely related to smoking and heavy drinking, and the degree offacial aging increases with the amount and time of exposure to tobacco and alcohol. On the contrary,
in facial skin and volume and is closely related to smoking and heavy drinking, and the degree offacial aging increases with the amount and time of exposure to tobacco and alcohol. On the contrary,quitting smoking and alcohol can delay the aging of facial skin. Dysfunction of alcohol metabolismin the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) gene knockout mouse or human allele also conﬁrmedthat alcohol can cause increased skin pigmentation, although the downstream mechanism of action isunclear [ 84]. While there are some studies on the relationship between alcohol intake and skin diseases,the relationship between alcohol intake and disease needs to be accurately determined based on realsituations [85].A high-fat diet is closely related to various diseases such as obesity, diabetes, fatty liver, and skinaging. Raman spectroscopy studies have shown that dietary fat intake is closely related to the body’s
adipose tissue and the lipid composition of the skin [ 86]. High-fat diets delay healing of the skin by
Nutrients 2020 ,12, 870 7 of 25promoting skin oxidative stress and inﬂammatory responses, reducing protein synthesis, and may alsocause morphological changes in skin and damage to matrix remodeling [ 87,88]. Psoriasis is a systemicchronic skin inﬂammatory disease that a ﬀects 2–5% of the population in western countries. The freefatty acids content in serum is an important parameter to reﬂect the severity of obesity-related diseases.A high-fat diet led to an increase in free fatty acid content in mice, which is an important factor thataggravates skin inﬂammatory psoriasis. Moreover, a high-fat diet can promote skin inﬂammation andcancer by enhancing the expression of inﬂammatory factors and tumor necrosis factor in the skin byUV-B [ 89–91]. Studies by Zhang and others [ 92] showed that after high-fat diet, the epidermal fattyacid-binding protein (E-FABP) of mice was signiﬁcantly upregulated in the skin, which promoted
the formation of lipid droplets and the activation of NLRP3 inﬂammator, and greatly increased theincidence of skin lesions in mice. In general, the e ﬀect of a high-fat diet is mainly to cause aging of theskin by causing skin oxidative stress to produce inﬂammatory damage.Some studies have also shown a close association between sugar and some food processingmethods (such as grilling, frying, baking, etc.) with skin aging, and their mechanisms are related toskin advanced glycation end products. A high-sugar diet, ultraviolet irradiation, and eating barbecuedfried foods, lead to the accumulation of AGEs and acceleration of skin aging. However, strict controlof blood sugar for four months can reduce the production of glycosylated collagen by 25%, andlow-sugar food prepared by boiling can also reduce the production of AGEs [ 93–95]. When the micewere fed with carbohydrate-controlled diets for 50 weeks, the epidermis and dermis were signiﬁcantly
thinned, autophagy was inhibited, and inﬂammation was exacerbated. Mechanistically, long-termintake of carbohydrates in mice promotes skin aging by activating the mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR) [ 96]. Further, high-salt, spicy, and extremely vegetarian diets are also considered to bedetrimental to skin health. Therefore, scientiﬁc, reasonable, healthy, and diverse eating habits andeating some antioxidant-rich foods are essential to maintaining skin health.Table 1.

Foodborne Antioxidants and Skin AgingAccording to free radical theory, lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and inﬂammation are theprimary causes of skin aging, disease, and dysfunction. This led to a medical revolution that emphasized
antioxidants and free radical scavengers for the prevention and treatment of skin aging [ 105,106].Oxygen-free radicals are ubiquitous in the process of cell metabolism and can interact with DNA,proteins, and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the body, causing breaks in the DNA chain and oxidativedamage, protein–protein cross-linking, protein–DNA cross-linking, and lipid metabolism oxidation,etc. ROS can cause various cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and aging. In vivo oxidation eventuallyleads to aging of the organism, so exogenous antioxidant supplements, with food being an importantsource, have become a topic of research [ 107]. Therefore, this section lists the key studies on the e ﬀectof natural antioxidants such as collagen peptides, polyphenols, vitamins, polysaccharides, and fattyacids extracted from foods on alleviating skin aging (Table 2). Some antioxidants are also extracted
from food, and their e ﬀect of alleviating skin aging is studied through local skin penetration in vitro .However, they then do not belong to diet, hence, they are not summarized here.4.1. Collagen PeptideCollagen is a long cylindrical polymeric protein, the main component of animal extracellular matrix(EMC), and the most abundant and widely distributed functional protein in mammals, accountingfor 25% to 30% of the total protein; some organisms constitute even up to 80% or more collagen,which have unique physiological functions and are widely used in food, medicine, tissue engineering,cosmetics, and other ﬁelds [ 108]. Traditionally, collagen is thought to improve skin health, but laterresearch found that collagen peptides with smaller molecular weight are easier to absorb and havemore signiﬁcant e ﬀects. While collagen is mainly absorbed and utilized in the form of peptides inmice, with a utilization rate of about 50%, collagen peptides can be almost completely absorbed and
utilized by the body [ 109]. Collagen peptide is a series of small molecular peptides obtained fromthe proteolytic hydrolysis of collagen. Because of their small molecular weight, easy absorption,anti-inﬂammatory, and antioxidant characteristics, collagen peptides have been studied as a newfavorite in recent years as exogenous antioxidants to relieve skin aging. Collagen peptides mainlycome from animal skin, bones, tendons, muscles, and other tissues. The research on animal-derivedcollagen peptides and other protein peptides in alleviating skin aging in recent years is summarized inTable 2. Nevertheless, due to associated risk of diseases such as mad cow disease, foot-and-mouthdisease, etc., and religious controversy of animal-derived collagen peptides, in recent years, people
Nutrients 2020 ,12, 870 9 of 25have also evaluated the e ﬀects of non-collagen peptides such as walnut protein peptides and wheyprotein peptides on alleviating skin aging in mice [ 110]. There are also some cases about the combinedapplication of protein peptides and other nutrients, although, they have not been summarized becausethe functions of various nutrients cannot be distinguished.Mechanistically, collagen peptides and other protein peptides may relieve skin aging througheither of the three pathways. First, the protein or peptide enters the blood circulation after digestionand absorption, and then participates in the skin ﬁbroblasts as a precursor of collagen synthesis, therebyprotecting the aging skin. Second, collagen peptides that enter skin cells incur anti-aging e ﬀects byremoving ROS from cells, protecting the cell’s endogenous antioxidant defense system, and reducing
oxidative damage and inﬂammatory responses in cells. In the third pathway, protein peptides enteringskin cells promote collagen and hyaluronic acid synthesis and inhibit the production of inﬂammationby regulating cytokines and activating TGF– β/Smad or other signaling pathways, while, these peptidesconcurrently also prevent skin collagen degradation by inhibiting the expression of proteases such asnuclear transcription factor activating protein–1 (AP–1), MMP–1 and MMP–3.4.2. PolyphenolsPolyphenols are secondary metabolites of plants and exist widely in vegetables, fruits, tea, andother plants. Due to their obvious antioxidant properties, polyphenols have become one of the mostimportant compounds to be used in cosmetics and nutritional cosmetology to combat skin aging. Inrecent years, tea polyphenols, curcumin, ﬂavonoids, silymarin, and grape resveratrol have been themost studied polyphenols with anti-aging properties. Polyphenols reduce oxidative damage and
inﬂammation in the skin through their antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory e ﬀects, mainly by inhibitingcollagen degradation, increased collagen synthesis, and inhibiting inﬂammation, which involvesthe regulation of matrix metalloproteinases, cytokines, and signaling pathways (e.g., Nrf2, NF- κB,MAPK, etc.) [111,112]. This article lists some experimental cases of food-derived polyphenol extractsto alleviate skin aging (Table 2), but most of the anti-aging e ﬀect of polyphenols has been veriﬁedin vitro through topical administration on target skin cells. Nonetheless, the clinical application ofpolyphenols in dermatology is still in its infancy, and there are relatively few reports on the cytotoxicityof polyphenols [113,114].4.3. PolysaccharidesPolysaccharides are polymer carbohydrates formed by the dehydration and condensation ofmultiple monosaccharides. Due to their pharmacological e ﬀects, such as improving immune function,
anti-tumor, anti-virus, anti-glucose, anti-oxidative, lowering blood lipids, and low cytotoxicity,polysaccharides are an ideal functional food and drug active ingredient [ 115]. Polysaccharideshave been the research focus from the past ﬁve years, and there are several reports on varioustypes of polysaccharides. In general, the research mainly focuses on the isolation and extractionof polysaccharides, structural identiﬁcation, modiﬁcation, and determination of physiological andpharmacological activities of polysaccharides and their derivatives. Antioxidant activity is one of theproperties of polysaccharides, particularly in terms of relief from skin aging. Polysaccharides suchas agaric polysaccharides, Lycium polysaccharides, algal polysaccharides, lingzhi polysaccharides,and mushroom polysaccharides have been found to alleviate skin aging. Dietary polysaccharides havea positive e ﬀect on the improvement of aging skin. Mechanistically, oral polysaccharides enhance skin
antioxidant enzyme activity, remove ROS, and reduce oxidative damage. They regulate the expression
antioxidant enzyme activity, remove ROS, and reduce oxidative damage. They regulate the expressionof Bcl–2, Bax, and Caspase–3 by activating Nrf2 /ARE and other pathways, and inhibit apoptosis.Finally, polysaccharides inhibit collagen degradation by inhibiting the expression of enzymes such asMMP–1 and MMP–9, maintaining a stable collagen ratio, repairing skin structure, and maintainingskin moisture content [116–121].
Nutrients 2020 ,12, 870 10 of 254.4. VitaminsMany vitamins have been tested for their antioxidant properties. They can reduce ROS in agingskin cells to low-activity molecules and reduce oxidative damage to key components of skin cells. Mostresearch has focused on vitamins A, B (B3, B12), E, D, C, coenzyme Q10, and lipoic acid. Retinoids arethe most common anti-aging drugs that have been used (such as retinoic acid prevents skin aging byregulating genes and MMPs) to treat and prevent photo-aging of the skin [ 97,98]. B vitamins havebeen shown to prevent skin aging mainly by preventing skin inﬂammation and pigmentation [ 99].Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant, its concentration in the skin is closely related to skin biologicalfunctions, and it is often used as a positive control for skin aging tests. It acts as an enzymatic factorand antioxidant to promote collagen synthesis and eliminate cellular ROS to relieve skin aging [ 100].
There seems to be a contradictory conclusion that vitamins D can alleviate skin photo-aging, becauselight not only synthesizes vitamins D but also causes skin aging. However, research shows thatvitamin D can reduce DNA damage, inﬂammation, and photocarcinogenesis caused by ultravioletrays, and thus, protect the skin [ 101]. A combination of vitamin E and C can help activate vitaminsE, which protects skin against chemical stimuli and UV-induced irritation and damage by inhibitinglipid peroxidation in the skin [ 102,103]. Coenzyme Q10 is a vitamin-like substance widely present inmeat foods, and its anti-aging function has been proven [ 122]. However, due to the instability, poorwater solubility, and low utilization of vitamins during storage, vitamins are often used in combinationwith other antioxidant ingredients (such as collagen, astaxanthin, carotenoids, etc.) to enhance theiranti-aging e ﬀects.4.5. Fatty Acids
anti-aging e ﬀects.4.5. Fatty AcidsLipids are an important part of the skin and are closely related to skin epidermal barrier function,membrane structure, internal environment balance, and damage repair. Skin aging is accompanied bya decrease in fat content, mainly due to a decrease in the ability of cells within the skin to synthesizeand secrete fat [ 123]. Besides, the amount of dietary fat intake is closely related to the lipid compositionof the body and skin tissues, and insu ﬃcient intake of essential fatty acids or abnormal fat metabolismleads to serious skin diseases [ 86,124]. Omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids play animportant role as human skin barriers, and also have certain e ﬀects in the prevention and treatmentof skin inﬂammation [ 104]. Oral olive oil can reduce skin aging induced by chronic psychologicalstress by acting on the NF-B NRF2 pathway in mice [ 125] (Table 2). Oral 7-MEGATM500 (a product
containing more than 50% palmitoleic acid containing ﬁsh oil, omega-7) has been shown to relieveUV-B and H 2O2-induced skin oxidative stress, inﬂammation, aging, and promotes skin regeneration inmice [ 126,127]. The fatty acids extracted from W. somnifera seeds have good anti-inﬂammatory e ﬀectsand exert an enhanced e ﬀect on psoriasis by reducing the release of pro-inﬂammatory factors (TNF- αand IL–6) [128]. The fermented ﬁsh oil protects skin aging by inhibiting PM 2.5-induced ROS, MMP-s,and blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinase /activator protein 1 (MAPK /AP–1) pathway [ 129].The e ﬀect of dietary and in vitro topical fatty acids on skin aging has been reviewed in detail by Wangand Wu [130].4.6. Other Anti-Aging NutrientsIn addition to the aforementioned foodborne antioxidants that can be used as functional foodingredients to relieve skin aging, the combined use of di ﬀerent types of antioxidants has also been
reported. Some studies have reported that dietary probiotics and their products can also alleviate skinaging. For example, probiotic fermentation can enhance the skin anti-photo-aging activity of Agastache
aging. For example, probiotic fermentation can enhance the skin anti-photo-aging activity of Agastacherugosa leaves, and some probiotic extracts also have the potential to improve aging skin. [ 131,132].There may be some foodborne antioxidants, which have not been mentioned in this article and need tobe discussed subsequently.

Nutrients 2020 ,12, 870 17 of 255. Conclusions and ProspectsSkin aging is a complex and long biological process, which is a ﬀected by genetic and environmentalfactors. Although stem cell transplantation, injection of hyaluronic acid, and retinoic acid have certaintherapeutic e ﬀects, each method has corresponding disadvantages. With the improvement of people’srequirements for the e ﬀectiveness, safety, and durability of treatment methods, prevention, and relieffrom skin aging through dietary management have become an inevitable trend. Therefore, afteranalyzing and summarizing relevant literature, we draw the following key conclusions:• People’s current understanding of diet to improve skin aging is still insu ﬃcient. While it isdiﬃcult for us to accurately deﬁne what is a healthy diet, and to quantify the relationship betweendiet and skin aging that convince the public, it is di ﬃcult for them to change their original lifestyleand diet, even if people have such knowledge.
and diet, even if people have such knowledge.• The issues of accurately quantifying the skin improvement e ﬀect of each nutrient intake, and thenegative e ﬀects of smoking, drinking, grilling, etc., on skin aging still need to be addressed.• The functional anti-aging ingredients in food mainly relieve skin aging in three ways. First,anti-aging ingredients (such as protein peptides and essential fatty acids) enter the skin as aprecursor after digestion and absorption and participate in the synthesis and metabolism of skincomponents. Second, anti-aging ingredients relieve skin oxidative damage by removing cellularROS and enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity. Third, the anti-aging component acts as anenzymatic factor, and regulates the expression of enzymes such as MMPs and AP–1, inhibitingthe degradation of skin components and maintaining the integrity of the skin structure.• The limitations of foodborne antioxidants such as unstable storage, low skin bioavailability,
and poor solubility, can be improved by chemical modiﬁcation, collagen drug delivery, and acombination of supplements.• Only oral supplementation is not enough to improve the skin. The combination of oral andexternal skin penetration should be the safest and the most e ﬀective way to improve skin aging.• Diet causes skin aging or improves skin aging and is di ﬃcult to simply apply to clinical research.While on the one hand, there is an ethical controversy, on the other hand, the experimental periodis too long to control the diet of volunteers for a single, long duration, and the uniformity ofclinical experimental conditions is not guaranteed, resulting in vague experimental results andinsuﬃcient credibility.• Improvement in skin aging through diet should not be rushed, because skin aging caused bydiet and improvement of aging performance by diet are long-term processes. There is also the
problem of metabolic processing of food and nutrients until they reach the skin. They have totravel a long way, and there is still a lot to study in this process.Author Contributions: C.C. and Z.X. wrote the manuscript, their contributions to this article are the same; C.G.and Y.W. revised the manuscript.
