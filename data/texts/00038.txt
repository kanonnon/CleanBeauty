three main criteria. First and foremost, the enzyme must show significant activation during the progression of the disease for which the herbal drug is prescribed. Secondly, the enzyme assay m ust be sensitive, specific and reproducible. Thirdly, a detailed chemo -profile of the herbal drug should be available.    The results of a study suggested that aging Triphala powder loses potency with respect to its ability to inhibit hyaluronidase and colla genase enzyme activities.   The correlative data between IC50 value of enzyme inhibition and a particular chemical marker provides a simple and definitive method for standardizing the  potency of the herbal drug.   This is because the enzyme chosen is strongly involved in the progression of the disease for which the herbal drug is prescribed.

World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  Consumers w orldwide are going green, and this is especially true in the cosmetics market. Over the last few years, growth in the beauty market has been driven by products that use natural or herbal components, and the market share of natural -based products has been increasing gradually. The India market has been traditionally inclined toward natural  products for their beauty needs  and Indians have a history and knowledge of using natural products. The need is for companies to translate the ancient ayurvedic recipes i nto modern, easy to - use formats with superior quality. Concern about harmful chemicals in beauty products has
increased consumer interest in natural cosmetics.  More and more products now include herbal and botanical ingredients.  Ayurvedic cosmetics are st ill co mpeting with synthetic products  and they need to strive to ensure quality that is similar to synthetic brands.   Formulation and Evaluation  In formulating cosmetic preparation non herbal ingredients are commonly used, but now herbal ingredients are g aining more acceptances among consumers. The usage of herbal ingredients should be based on experience, so that the properties of the formulation are not altered. The formulation of herbal cosmetics follows the same procedures as that of the cosmetic prepa ration prepared with synthetic origin. The formulations are based on the selection of proper emulsifying agents, composition of the appropriate ingredients and modified  methodology to get the required  product. The manufacturers should ensure the
quality of  the raw materials and the finished products by quality control testing. The other parameters tested include organoleptic characteristics, pH, viscosity, refrigeration and stability towards light. The major drawback with herbal ingredient is the attack of microbes rendering them unfit for human use . So care must be taken to prevent the bacterial attack completely. The evaluation of herbal cosmetics is very essential and there is no hard and fast code of practice, which can be laid down for all products or e ven product types. The evaluation of herbal cosmetics is essentially the same as that for the other common cosmetics products which are available in market. The ingredients used in cosmetics should be of the highest quality so as to minimize the irritancy and sensitivity reaction. The physical evaluation parameters used for herbal cosmetics include the colour, odour, form of physical
state, pH, and net content. The other evaluations done for herbal cosmetics are sensitivity test, irritation test and grittin ess. The irritancy and sensitivity test can be performed by either diagnostic testing or by the prophetic or predi ctive testing . The test will help to detect the irritant and sensitizing potential of new cosmetic ingredients. The evaluations of facial

World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research  cosm etics are grouped into physical parameters, esthetic and pressure testing. The physical parameters include colour, adhesiveness, pH, net content, odour, size and shape of the particle and finally the moisture content. The dentifrices are evaluated for abra siveness, degree of luster production, consistency, pH, specific gravity, taste, odour, colour, moisture content and fragrance test. The hair conditioners are evaluated for softness, luster, lubricity, body texture and set retention, irritation on eye, ora l toxicity, fragrance test, colour and consistency. The cosmetics in the form of semisolid products are tested for bleeding and
rheology in addition to the other routine tests. The microbial test, toxicity test and stability studies were also performed for  evaluating the cosmetics products. The analytical chemist continues to have a major role in selecting the most appropriate method, managing the data, interpreting the results. The analytical techniques are basically classified into classical method and in strumental method. The classical methods are based on the observation and measurement of the chemical reactivity of analytes in solution. The instrumental methods are based upon the detailed examination of the physical or physicochemical properties of analytes related to their molecular or atomic structures. The methods will provide information of the qualitative data regarding the chemical nature of compound and detection of specific compounds in the cosmetic products. The parameters like gloss and individ ualization are
measured by instrumental me thod utilizing light reflection . The hair strength can be evaluated by measuring the force required to strech and break individual hair fibres by Instron Tester, Dia-stron Miniature Tensile Tester and Automatic Car ousel arrangement. The hair fiber cross -sectional area which contributes the tensile strength can be measure by microscopy or by weighing standard lengths of hair fiber. Biological  screening establishes the efficacy of formulated herbal hair oil.   Evaluati on of Cosmetics   Physical Evaluation : Colour,  Odour, Form,  pH, Net Content   Grittiness:  Rub a pinch of product on skin and  then observe with magnifying glass, if there is no rash or eruption then it is considered free from grittiness.   Bleeding test:  This tes t is especially for semisolid preparation. observe the bleeding of liquid i.e liquid phase omits from preparation. If no bleeding then the product can be called as stable at climatic condion.
called as stable at climatic condion.   Rheology:  It is used to study flow property of liquid or semisol id products spredabilidy , pourability of product have to be determine .

World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research   Microbial test : As herbal sensitive to microbial growth,  microbial has to be carried out by agar well diffusion method or tubidometric method.   Stability studies:  It is carried out at e levated temperatures (like 45,90and 1200c), relatively humidity and p H a period of 6 months and above parameter are evaluated periodically to  changes in product .  Infra -red spectroscopy studies : The studies are useful for determination of exipients compatib ility.  Chromatographic Evaluation : The contents of cosmetic product can be determine and confirmed by chromatography like TLC,  HPTLC,  HPLC , Gas chromatography .  In vitro drug release : This study can be performed by  simple dialysis tube method .the
concentra tion of drug release can be determined by HPLC or UV spectrophotometer.   In vitro skin permeation studies : In vitro skin penetration studies can be performed with human cadaver skin, using keshary -chien cells or Franz diffusion cells.    In vitro  sun protecti on factor determination by  UV spectrophotometer : This method used to deter mine SPF (sun protection factor ). It measures the spectral transmittance at UV wavelengths from 280 to 400 nm and thus reduction of the irradiation after passing through a film of th e product .calculate the SPF factor following formula -    Where,   CF = CORRECTION factor i.e. 10,   EE (λ)  = erythmogenic effect  of radiation with wavelength λ.    Abs (λ)  = spectrophotometric absorbance values at wavelength λ.   Sensitivity test : It is also called as patch test .apply product on 1 cm2 of animal skin or human epidermis , if there is no inflammation or rashes then  it is free from sensitivity.
 Irritation test:  Apply the product same as above and observe for erythema and edema at 24 an d 72 hours. Calculate the primary irritation index based on the  sum of the scroed reaction divided by 24.   Toxicity  test: It is carried out on animal to calculate LD/50 values  and acute , chronic toxicity parameter  using mice preferably.   Form and form stabil ity test for shampoo:  Thus is  a very simple method developed by Ross -Miles . take the 200 ml of 0.1%shampoo solution and pass through the orifice into a glass column containing 500 ml of the same solution.
