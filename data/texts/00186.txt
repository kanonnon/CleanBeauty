Moita3,13 and Clotilde Thery1,2,13Exosomes are secreted membrane vesicles that share structural and biochemical characteristics with intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes (MVEs). Exosomes could be involved in intercellular communication and in the pathogenesis of infectious and degenerative diseases. The molecular mechanisms of exosome biogenesis and secretion are, however, poorly understood. Using an RNA interference (RNAi) screen, we identified five Rab GTPases that promote exosome secretion in HeLa
cells. Among these, Rab27a and Rab27b were found to function in MVE docking at the plasma membrane. The size of MVEs was strongly increased by Rab27a silencing, whereas MVEs were redistributed towards the perinuclear region upon Rab27b silencing. Thus, the two Rab27 isoforms have different roles in the exosomal pathway. In addition, silencing two known Rab27 effectors, Slp4 (also known as SYTL4, synaptotagmin-like 4) and Slac2b (also known as EXPH5, exophilin 5), inhibited exosome secretion and phenocopied silencing of Rab27a and Rab27b, respectively. Our results therefore strengthen the link between MVEs and exosomes, and introduce ways of manipulating exosome secretion in vivo.Exosomes are membrane vesicles secreted into the extracellular space by numerous cell types1–4. These nanometre-sized vesicles have a simi -lar membrane orientation as the plasma membrane, and a canonical protein composition, mostly including proteins from the endocytic sys -
tem, the plasma membrane and the cytosol. In addition, exosomes also contain proteins specific to the cell type from which they originate and that are probably important for their extracellular functions. Based on in vitro  studies, it has been proposed that exosomes could participate in the induction of immune responses5–7, in the dissemination of viruses or prions8,9, in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases10 and in mediating communication between tumour cells and their microenvi -ronment11–13. However, it has not been conclusively demonstrated that in vivo exosome secretion has a role in any physiological process due to the inability to specifically inhibit or increase it. Indeed, the molecular mechanisms of exosome secretion are not completely understood.Evidence collected during the last 20  years suggests that, in most cell types, exosomes correspond to secreted intraluminal vesicles of MVEs4.
Intraluminal vesicles are formed by inward budding of the limiting membrane of MVEs into the lumen of these endosomes14. Observations, using electron microscopy, of fusion profiles between MVEs and the plasma membrane and the consequent release of intraluminal vesicles as exosomes has so far been the strongest evidence for the endosomal origin of exosomes5,6,15. Nevertheless, in some cell types, such as T lym -phocytes, exosomes bud at the plasma membrane from endosome-like domains16. Therefore, identification of molecules that control the intra -cellular trafficking of MVEs and their fusion with the plasma membrane will increase our understanding of exosome secretion. Most intracellular transport pathways are controlled by conserved fami -lies of cytosolic proteins, including the Rab family of small GTPases. Rab proteins control different steps of vesicular trafficking, including budding, motility and docking and fusion of different vesicular transport intermedi -

ARTICLESsilencing of Rab27a and Rab27b, respectively, suggesting a preferential interaction between these proteins for exosome secretion.RESULTSSemi-quantitative detection of exosomes in cell culture supernatantsTo screen for molecules specifically involved in exosome secretion, we developed a semi-quantitative fluorescence-activated cell scanning (FACS)-based assay that allowed simultaneous detection of exosomes and proteins secreted through the classical secretory pathway in small volumes of cell culture supernatants. The HeLa B6H4 tumour cell line, which stably expresses the transactivator CIITA (an activator of the MHC class II family genes, including HLA-DR ) and a secreted form of chicken ovalbumin (OV A), was used. These cells secrete HLA-DR-positive  exosomes and soluble OV A (through the classical secretory pathway), allowing differentiation of both pathways. Exosomes present in cell cul-ture supernatants were captured onto beads coated with antibodies to
CD63, a tetraspanin strongly enriched in late endosomes and exosomes20, and were detected by FACS after staining with anti-HLA-DR and anti-CD81 fluorescent antibodies (CD81 is another tetraspanin abundant on exosomes)5,20, or annexin V (which binds to the phosphatidylserine present at the surface of exosomes; Fig.  1a)21. Membrane vesicles with a diameter ranging from 50  to 100  nm and with the typical cup-shaped morphology of exosomes were detected on the surface of the beads by electron microscopy (Fig.  1b). Exosome detection was dependent on the number of exosome-secreting cells present in the wells (Fig.  1c, d), with a sensitivity threshold of 75,000 cells per well.

ARTICLESwere used, the FACS signals were significantly lower than those obtained from supernatants of living cells (Fig.  1e).Secretion of soluble OV A in cell culture supernatants was detected using beads coated with anti-OV A antibodies and stained with a  fluorescent anti-OV A antibody (Supplementary Information, Fig.  S1). This methodology allowed the quantitative detection of OV A from live cells, with a sensitivity threshold of 30,000 cells per well.This FACS-based assay thus allowed simultaneous quantification of CD63/CD81/HLA-DR/phosphatidylserine-positive membrane vesicles (corresponding to exosomes) and of OV A, produced by living cells, in very small volumes of culture supernatants. The role of Rab GTPase family members in exosome secretionThe effects of various shRNAs on exosome secretion were analysed by screening a lentiviral shRNA library targeting 59 members of the Rab GTPase family, using the methodology described above.

ARTICLESinduced a significant modification in the secretion of exosomes, but not of OV A, were selected for two additional rounds of validation.Some examples of Rab proteins that did not fulfil the selection criteria are shown in Fig.  2b. Silencing of Rab6a inhibited the secre -tion of OV A but did not affect exosome secretion, whereas inhibi -tion of Rab7 or Rab11a did not significantly modify either exosome or OVA secretion. In contrast, five Rab proteins whose inhibition by shRNA resulted in decreased exosome secretion in at least five independent wells, and for which most shRNA concomitantly modi -fied the phenotype and the mRNA expression level (as determined by quantitiative PCR, qPCR), were finally selected (Fig.  2c): Rab2b, Rab5a, Rab9a, Rab27a and Rab27b. Most of these Rab proteins have been previously associated with endocytic functions, in agreement with the postulated endosomal origin of exosomes.

ARTICLESon exosomes captured by CD63-coated beads (Fig.  2d). Silencing of both Rab27a and Rab27b decreased annexin V staining, thus showing a general decrease of secretion of exosome-associated lipids.Rab27a and Rab27b silencing inhibits exosome secretion without modifying exosome protein compositionInhibition of exosome secretion in cells knocked down for Rab27a and Rab27b was confirmed by standard exosome purification techniques24. First, cells transfected with shRNA  3 for RAB27A  or shRNA  1 for RAB27B  were amplified to produce a large volume of supernatant. Expression of these genes was specifically and significantly downregulated in these cells (Supplementary Information, Fig.  S2a). Exosomes were purified from cell supernatant by ultracentrifugation24 (at 100,000 g). The total amount of secreted exosomes, determined by measuring the total amount of protein in a pellet (Fig.  3a) or by the FACS-based assay (Supplementary
Information, Fig.  S2b), was significantly reduced in both knockdown cells when compared with control cells.Consistent with these findings, a reduction in the signals of several exosome markers (HLA-DR, CD63, Tsg101 and Hsc70) was observed by western blotting of exosomes purified from the supernatant of the same number of Rab27a-knockdown or Rab27b-knockdown secreting cells when compared with control cells (Fig.  3b; Supplementary Information, cRab27a CD63Rab6GAGAMVEa bRab27aRab27bCD6315Rab27a-GFP10CD6315Rab27a-GFP10CD63MergeRab6Rab27b CD63MergeMergeFigure 5  Differential intracellular distribution of Rab27a and Rab27b.

ARTICLESFigS6a). Nevertheless, all markers were detected in exosomes from knockdown cells when similar amounts of exosomal proteins where analysed (Fig.  3c; Supplementary Information, Fig.S6b). In addition, electron microscopy showed that exosomes secreted by Rab27a- and Rab27b-knockdown cells were identical in size and morphology to exo -somes produced by control cells (Fig.  3d).These data show that silencing of either Rab27a or Rab27b reduces the amount of exosomes released in the cell culture supernatant, but does not modify exosome protein content or morphology.Different phenotypes of MVEs are observed in Rab27a- and Rab27b-knockdown cellsTo gain further insight into the mechanism responsible for the reduced exosome secretion in Rab27a- or Rab27b-knockdown cells, the subcel -lular distribution and the morphology of MVEs were investigated using CD63 as a marker. We first observed, by FACS analysis, that the propor -
tion of intracellular to surface CD63 was increased in Rab27a-, but not Rab27b-, knockdown cells when compared with control cells (Fig.  4a). Thus, in the absence of Rab27a, CD63 accumulates in internal compart -ments, whereas the absence of Rab27b does not induce such behaviour.The subcellular distribution of CD63 was then analysed by immun -ofluorescence imaging (Fig.  4b, c). In control and Rab27a-knockdown cells, CD63-positive MVEs appeared to be homogenously distributed throughout the cell, but their size was significantly increased upon Rab27a silencing (Fig.  4b, upper and middle panels; Fig.  4c). In sharp contrast, Rab27b-knockdown cells showed a characteristic asymmetrical perinuclear accumulation of CD63-positive organelles, but without sig -nificant alteration of the size of these organelles, compared with control cells (Fig.  4b, lower panel, Fig.  4c). Consistent with these findings, elec -tron microscopy analysis showed that MVEs from Rab27a-knockdown
cells were significantly larger (Fig.  4d) than those from control cells, whereas in Rab27b-knockdown cells MVEs were smaller (Fig.  4d) and showed a clustered distribution (data not shown). Thus, although silenc -ing of either Rab27a or Rab27b impairs exosome secretion, the induction of different changes in the size and distribution of CD63-positive MVEs suggests that these proteins have different roles in the pathway.Rab27a and Rab27b have different subcellular localizationsWe thus investigated whether these two proteins could function in differ -ent compartments by analysing their respective subcellular localizations. GFP-tagged versions of both Rab27a and Rab27b presented a dough -nut-like pattern surrounding CD63-positive compartments (Fig.  5a). However, most Rab27b, but not Rab27a, was mainly concentrated in a perinuclear area labelled by the Golgi-associated proteins Rab6 (Fig.  5a) and TGN46 (data not shown). Consistent with this, electron microscopic
observation showed that although both Rab27a and Rab27b were associ -ated with the limiting membrane of MVEs, Rab27b was also observed in the membrane of Golgi stacks and in vesicles located in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) area (Fig.  5b).When mCherry–Rab27a and GFP–Rab27b were expressed simul -taneously in HeLa cells, both Rab27a and Rab27b were partially associated with CD63-positive compartments (Fig.  5c), but Rab27b was predominantly in the perinuclear area and was partially colocal -ized with TGN46 (data not shown). Four groups of CD63-positive organelles could be identified based on their association with the Rab27 isoforms: most organelles were Rab27a- and b-negative, about 1/5 were Rab27a-positive and b-negative and less than 10% were either Rab27a- and b-positive or Rab27a-negative and b-positive. However, the proportion of Rab27-positive MVEs was increased in the subplas -malemmal region (Supplementary Information, Fig.  S3).
Rab27a and Rab27b therefore have different subcellular distributions:
the proportion of Rab27-positive MVEs was increased in the subplas -malemmal region (Supplementary Information, Fig.  S3).Rab27a and Rab27b therefore have different subcellular distributions: Rab27b predominantly presents an asymmetrical perinuclear distribution in the TGN area and a minor localization to CD63-positive compartments, whereas Rab27a is preferentially associated with CD63-positive MVEs.Rab27a or Rab27b silencing reduces MVE docking to the plasma membraneTo further analyse exosome secretion, we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to image MVEs in the subplasmalem -mal region of live cells (Fig.  6; Supplementary Information, Fig.  S3 and Movies  1–3). In this region, around 30% and 40% of CD63-positive vesicles were labelled with GFP–Rab27b and GFP–Rab27a, respectively (Supplementary Information, Fig.  S3a), supporting a possible role of both Rab27 isoforms in MVE exocytosis. Rab27b silencing significantly
lowered MVE density (Fig.  6a), in agreement with the perinuclear relo -calization of MVEs observed by epifluorescence microscopy (Fig.  4b). In addition, in Rab27a- and Ra27b-knockdown cells, MVEs were signifi -cantly less present near the borders of the cell footprint (Supplementary Information, Fig.  S3b), suggesting that Rab27a and Rab27b promote MVE distribution to the cell periphery.The movements of MVEs were then analysed by tracking individual trajectories25 (Supplementary Information, Movies  1–3). The diffusion coefficient Dxy, an index of mobility, was calculated along trajectories using a rolling analysis window25. Dxy values were higher in Rab27a- or Rab27b-knockdown cells than in control cells ( P < 0.0001), and in Rab27b- than in Rab27a-knockdown cells ( P = 0.006; Fig.  6b). Fewer vesicles had very low Dxy values in Rab27a- or Rab27b-knockdown cells, suggesting that both may participate in MVE attachment (docking) to the plasma membrane,
a process that restricts vesicle motion25–27. To set a threshold value below which vesicles could be considered immobile, we plotted the distribution of instantaneous Dxy values (Supplementary Information, Fig.  S3c). A major peak comprising the lowest values was centered around 10–4 μm2 s–1 (that is, the mean Dxy of immobilized beads on our setup)26. Vesicles presenting a Dxy less than three times this value were considered immobile. Using this criterion, we categorized Dxy values computed on entire trajectories and found that the percentage of docked structures was significantly lowered by Rab27a or Rab27b silencing (Fig.  6c). Moreover, 82% of the enlarged MVEs observed upon Rab27a silencing (Fig.  4b) showed a mean Dxy > 3 × 10–4 μm2 s–1 (50 structures from 5 cells) and were thus not docked.To distinguish true vesicle docking from other processes, we meas -ured the duration of immobilization events along trajectories. Rab27a
or Rab27b silencing reduced the percentage of vesicles that were always immobile and increased the percentage of vesicles never immobile (Fig.  6d). Survival curves of immobilization times were best fitted with two exponentials, indicating the existence of two different processes (Fig.  6e). The short-lasting component may reflect transient tethering to the plasma membrane or phases of slow diffusion. We considered long-lasting immobilization to reflect MVE docking. Using this refined crite -rion of docking, we conclude that Rab27a or Rab27b silencing reduced both the number (0.25  and 0.28 docking events per trajectory in Rab27a- and Rab27b-knockdown cells, respectively, compared with 0.44  in con -trol cells) and the characteristic time (10.1 and 9.3  s in Rab27a- and nature cell biology   VOLUME 12 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2010  25   © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

ARTICLESof microtubule-based motion)26 were increased in Rab27b-knockdown (but not in Rab27a-knockdown) cells, compared with control cells. This behaviour accounted for the increased proportion of structures with high mean Dxy (> 20 × 10–4 μm2 s–1; Fig.  6c) observed in Rab27b-knockdown cells. Therefore, Rab27b also negatively regulates long-range movements of MVEs.Slp4 and Slac2b are two Rab27 effectors involved in exosome productionRab proteins exert their functions by interacting with multiple effectors. We observed that 7  of the 11 Rab27 effector proteins were expressed in HeLa B6H4 cells (Supplementary Information, Table  1). Their genes were then silenced with specific shRNAs, and exosomes and OV A in cell culture supernatants were quantified using the FACS-based assay.Silencing of EXPH5 (gene encoding Slac2b), SYTL4  (gene encoding Slp4) or UNC13D  (gene encoding Munc13–4) significantly reduced exo -
some secretion, with at least 2  of the 4–5 shRNAs that targeted each gene (Fig.  7a). In cells transduced with shRNAs against SYTL4  and EXPH5 , the level of exosome secretion reflected the level of mRNA expression (Fig.  7b). In contrast, in cells transduced with UNC13D shRNA, although shRNAs 1, 2  and 3 decreased both exosome secretion and mRNA levels, shRNAs 4  and 5 strongly inhibited mRNA expression without affecting exosome secretion (Fig.  7a, b), suggesting off-target effects of the shRNA. Consequently, only Slac2b and Slp4 were chosen for further analysis, although a role of Munc13–4  in exosome secretion cannot be ruled out. In addition to reducing exosome secretion, knock down of the effectors increased OV A secretion (Fig.  7a), suggesting that they also have Rab27-independent roles in the conventional secretion pathway.Large-scale cultures of cells expressing lentiviruses 3 ( EXPH5  shRNA) or 3 ( SYTL4  shRNA) were prepared. Specific decrease of Slp4 at the
protein level was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig.  7c; Supplementary Information, FigS6c), but we could not specifically detect Slac2b by western blotting of B6H4 cell lysates, probably due to the low level of expression. Exosomes secreted by the same amount of cells were puri -fied from cell culture supernatants and analysed by western blotting (Fig.  7d; Supplementary Information, FigS6e): a significant reduction in the amount of CD63, HLA-DR and Tsg101 secreted in exosomes was observed in Slp4- and Slac2b-knockdown cells. These results show that two Rab27 effectors, Slp4 and Slac2b, are positive regulators of exosome secretion in HeLa B6H4 cells.Slp4 and Slac2b-knockdown cells are phenocopies of Rab27a and Rab27b-knockdown cells, respectivelyThe distribution and morphology of CD63-positive compartments was then studied in Slac2b- and Slp4-knockdown cells. In Slp4-knockdown cells, an intracellular accumulation of CD63 was observed both by
FACS (Fig.  7e) and by immunofluorescence (Fig.  7f, left and middle panels), resembling the phenotype observed in Rab27a-knockdown cells (Fig.  4a). In contrast, FACS analysis of Slac2b-knockdown cells did not show an accumulation of CD63 either at the cell surface or intracellularly, but showed an asymmetrical perinuclear accumulation of CD63-positive vesicles of normal size, mimicking the phenotype observed in Rab27b-knockdown cells (Fig.  7f, right panel). Altogether, loss of function of Slp4 and Slac2b induces phenotypes that, in terms of exosome secretion as well as morphology and distribution of MVEs, highly resemble those observed in cells knocked down for Rab27a and Rab27b, respectively. These observations suggest that Slp4 mediates the function of Rab27a, while Slac2b is required for the function of Rab27b.Consistent with this idea, in cells co-transfected with T7-tagged Slp4 or Slac2b and GFP-tagged Rab27a or Rab27b, Slp4 colocalized with Rab27a
to doughnut-like structures containing CD63 (Fig.  8a, top panel). In
Slac2b and GFP-tagged Rab27a or Rab27b, Slp4 colocalized with Rab27a to doughnut-like structures containing CD63 (Fig.  8a, top panel). In contrast, Slp4 and Rab27b labelled different CD63-positive structures (Fig.  8a, bottom panel). The Rab27a–Slp4 interaction was also con -firmed by the observation that the Slp4 protein level was decreased in Rab27a-knockdown cells (but not in Rab27b-knockdown cells; Fig.  8b; Supplementary Information, Fig.  S6d), whereas the SYTL4 mRNA level was increased (Fig.  8c), suggesting a stabilizing interaction of Rab27a and Slp4 proteins. Due to low expression level of endogenous Slac2b, which could not be detected by the available antibodies, and to poor expres -sion of a T7-Slac2b construct in our cell line, we could neither determine its intracellular distribution nor its preferential association with Rab27b. Finally, co-silencing of Rab27a and Slp4 led to a similar phenotype as
single silencing of each (that is, enlarged MVEs), whereas co-silencing of Rab27b and Slp4 induced mainly the perinuclear redistribution of MVEs typical in Rab27b-knockdown cells, thus confirming that Rab27b and Slp4 are not functionally associated (Supplementary Information, Fig.  S4).These observations thus show that Rab27a and Slp4 function together in the MVE and exosome pathway of HeLa cells. By contrast, although silencing of Slac2b induces a phenocopy of Rab27b-knockdown cells, for technical reasons we could not demonstrate the functional interaction between these two proteins.DiscussionThree major results are presented here. First, we set up an assay allow -ing medium-scale screens of the molecular machinery involved in exosome secretion. Second, using this assay, we identified several Rab family members, including Rab27a and Rab27b, that function in exo -some secretion. Third, we found that Rab27a and Rab27b serve both
common and different roles, most likely through the Slp4 and Slac2b effector proteins, respectively, in the intracellular trafficking of MVEs, leading to exosome secretion.The identification of Rab GTPases that affect both the morphology and distribution of CD63-positive MVEs and exosome secretion con -firms the endocytic origin of exosomes, which was proposed previously based on results from elegant electron microscopy studies5,15. In addition, as reducing mRNA expression of RAB27  genes to less than 20% of the control induced >  50% reduction in exosome secretion, most secreted exosomes originate from a Rab27-dependent secretion event, probably due to fusion of late endocytic compartments with the plasma membrane. In addition to Rab27, three other Rabs related to the endocytic pathway were identified in this study as being potentially involved in exosome secretion: Rab9 and Rab5 participate in the trafficking of late and early
endosomes, respectively17,28, and Rab2, although generally described as allowing trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, is phylogenetically closer to Rab4, Rab11 and Rab14 (ref.  29), which are associated with the endocytic pathway. Surprisingly, other Rab GTPases associated with the endocytic system, Rab7 and Rab11, did not modify exosome secretion. These observations suggest that a specific subset of MVEs participates in the generation of exosomes, as recently proposed for dendritic cells30.Rab27a and Rab27b have been found previously to be involved in the regulated secretion of secretory granules (that is, compartments nature cell biology   VOLUME 12 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2010  27   © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

ARTICLESof Golgi origin)31–33 and of lysosome-related organelles in mast cells34, platelets35 and cytolytic T lymphocytes36. In this study, we found that Rab27a and Rab27b have a key role in exosome secretion by promoting the targeting of MVEs to the cell periphery and their docking at the plasma membrane.Functional redundancy between Rab27a and Rab27b depends on the cell type and/or the secretory process studied34,35,37. Interestingly, we show here that in the HeLa cell line, Rab27a and Rab27b perform dif -ferent and non-redundant tasks in the exosomal pathway.The phenotype of MVEs induced by Rab27b silencing (inhibition of docking, clustering in the perinuclear area and high velocity movements along microtubules), is similar to the phenotype of secretory granules31 and melanosomes38,39 induced by silencing myosin V a, a downstream effector of Rab27a, and suggests that Rab27b mediates the transfer of MVEs from
microtubules to the actin-rich cortex and their retention at the cell periph -ery. In addition, the smaller size of MVEs observed by electron microscopy in Rab27b-knockdown cells suggests that Rab27b could participate in the transfer of membranes from the TGN to MVEs, as proposed previously40.50040030020010000255075100ControlSlac2b KDSlp4 KDSlp4 level(Percentage of control)Selection level(percentage of control)Slp4TubulinControlSlac2b KD Slp4 KDHLA-DRCD63Gp96Tsg1010.13 0.13 0.13 9 9 9CLExo CLExo CLExoControl Slp4 KD Slac2b KD0255075100ControlSlp4 KDSlac2b KDControlSlp4 KDSlac2b KD********Percentage of maximumControl shRNAKDIsotype controlSlp4 KDSlac2b KDSurface CD63 Total CD63HLA-DR Tsg101EXPH5 SYTL4 UNC13D12340501001234 1234 5mRNA expression (percentage of control)250200150100500EXPH5SYTL2 SYTL3 SYTL4 EXPH5SYTL2 SYTL3 SYTL4UNC13D UNC13DNoc2 Noc2ExosomeOVA*********************************ControlSlp4 KDSlac2b KD0255075

ARTICLESIn contrast, Rab27a silencing reduces docking of MVEs and increases their size. This could be due to lack of motor linkage, resulting in appar -ently enlarged compartments. Alternatively, either Rab27a is required for docking and vesicles fuse with each other instead of fusing with the plasma membrane when Rab27a is absent, or Rab27a prevents fusion of CD63-positive compartments with each other or with other vesicular intermediates, and its absence leads to the formation of enlarged compart -ments whose size physically impairs docking to the plasma membrane.In addition, we show here that silencing of the Rab27 effectors Slp4 and Slac2b phenocopies the silencing of Rab27a and Rab27b, respec -tively, and that Slp4 preferentially associates with Rab27a, rather than with Rab27b, and thus regulates the Rab27a-dependent docking event leading to exosome secretion in HeLa cells. The preferential interaction
of Rab27b with Slac2b in HeLa cells could not be demonstrated here, although it has been previously demonstrated in vitro41.Finally, this work was performed using the HeLa model cell line: the physiological processes at work in HeLa cells may not be identical to those of other cell types. However, mouse dendritic cells deficient in both Rab27a and Rab27b secrete half the amount of exosomes that their wild-type counterparts do (Supplementary Information, Fig.  S5) and our preliminary data suggest that silencing of Rab27a in a mouse tumour cell line also leads to reduced exosome secretion (A.

ARTICLESunpublished data). Thus, the Rab27 subfamily is probably also important in exosome secretion by other cell types.Overall, the potential to specifically inhibit exosome secretion with -out affecting the regular secretory pathway of soluble proteins paves the way for the manipulation of exosome secretion in vivo, to eventually answer the long-standing question of the physiological functions of exosomes in vivo.

DOI: 10.1038/ncb2000 METHODSMETHODSCells and reagents.  HeLa-CIITA cells42 were stably transfected with pcDNA3 encoding the OVA  cDNA fused to the signal peptide of MFG -E8/lactadherin13, and a subclone named B6H4 was selected. These cells were cultured in DMEM containing 4.5  g l–1 glucose (Invitrogen) 10% fetal calf serum (Abcys), 2  mM glutamine, 100  IU ml–1 penicillin, 100  μg ml–1 streptomycin, 300  μg ml–1 hygro -mycin B (Calbiochem) and 500  μg ml–1 geneticin (Invitrogen).Plasmids used for transient transfections (performed with Bio-Rad gene pulser II)42 include pEGFPC3–Rab27a (ref. 43), pEGFPC3–Rab27b (ref.  23), pEGFP–bos-CD63 (ref.  44), pT7–Slp4 (ref.  45), mCherry–Rab27a generated by PCR from pcDNA3.1mcherry46 and pEGFPC3–Rab27a, and cloned into pCMVMyc vector (A.N.H., unpublished data)38.Lentiviruses expressing shRNA were obtained from the RNAi consortium (TRC) and produced as described previously47. Sequences of the shRNA used
for large scale cultures were: RAB27A , 5´-GCTGCCAATGGGACAAACATA-3´; RAB27B , CCCAAATTCATCACTACAGTA-3´; SYTL4 , 5´-CCTCCCTTTACAT -GGAAAGAT-3´ and EXPH5 , 5´-CCCAAACTAGAAGAAGTTCTT-3´.Antibodies used for FACS analysis were: mouse anti-human CD63 (FC-5.01, Zymed) and goat anti-OV A (ICN) for coupling to beads; PE-conjugated anti-HLA-DR (L243, BD), anti-CD81 (BD) and rabbit anti-OV A (Sigma) coupled to Alexa488 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce). Antibodes used for immunoblotting were: goat anti-Tsg101 (Santa Cruz); rat anti-Gp96 and anti –Hsc70 (Stressgen); mouse anti-CD63 (Zymed), anti-HLA-DR (clone 1B5) and anti-Rab27a (clone 4B12; ref.  43); rabbit anti-Rab27b (ref.  35), anti-Slp4 (ref. 33) and anti-Slac2b (ref.  33); HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch). Antibodies used for immunofluorescence and immunoelec -tron microscopy were: mouse anti-CD63 (Zymed); rabbit anti-Rab6 (Santa Cruz)
and anti-GFP (Invitrogen); Alexa488-anti-mouse and Cy3-anti-rabbit (Jackson Immunoresearch); DAPI (Molecular Probes).Immunoadsorbtion and detection of exosomes by FACS.  Anti-human CD63 or anti-OV A antibodies were coupled to 4-μm aldehyde-sulfate beads (Invitrogen) by incubating 35  μg of antibody with 1  × 108 beads followed by blocking of remaining activated groups with PBS -4% BSA.Cell culture supernatants were cleared by centrifugations at 300 g (for 5 min) and 2,000 g (for 20  min). Cleared supernatants (100  μl) were incu -bated with 20,000 anti-CD63- and 20,000 anti-OVA-coupled beads overnight at room temperature with 6,500  rpm horizontal shaking. Beads were washed twice in PBS -2% BSA and incubated with PE -anti-HLA-DR  + PE-anti-CD81 and Alexa488-anti-OVA (all at a 1:100 dilution) for 30  min on ice. Beads were washed twice in annexin V buffer (BD Biosciences) and incubated with APC-conjugated annexin V (1:10) for 10  min. Beads were acquired
on a FACSCalibur (BD) and data were analysed with FlowJo software (Tree Star). Threshold of negative staining was obtained with beads incubated with unconditioned medium, and for each culture condition, arbitrary units (AU) of exosome or OV A secretion were calculated as a percentage of positive beads × MFI (mean fluoresence intensity) of positive beads. To rule out detection of apoptotic blebs, a total of 50,000 cells either UV-irradiated or untreated were seeded in a 96-well plate. After 12  h incubation, exosome depleted-medium was added and 24  h later supernatants were incubated with anti-CD63-coated beads and analysed by FACS.Lentiviral infection and screening procedure.  HeLa B6H4 cells were plated in 96-well round-bottom plates at 2,500 cells per well (day zero). At day 1, cells were infected with lentiviral vectors in the presence of 8  μg ml–1 polybrene and 5  μg ml–1 puromycin was added at day 2. Medium was replaced with
exosome-depleted medium at day 4. Supernatants were collected 48  h later
and 5  μg ml–1 puromycin was added at day 2. Medium was replaced with exosome-depleted medium at day 4. Supernatants were collected 48  h later for OVA and exosome quantification, and the amount of live cells in each well was determined using Cell titer blue reagent viability assay (Promega). OVA and exosome secretions per well were normalized to the number of viable cells, and only wells containing at least 75,000 cells were analysed. In each experiment, the basal level of exosome or OVA secretion (control) was calculated as either AU of cells transduced with control scrambled shRNA, or mean of AU of one entire plate. A candidate gene was defined as a hit if two or more shRNAs modified AU of exosome secretion, in duplicate, by more than one standard deviation from the control. Results are presented as percent of AU of control.Quantitative reverse transcription‑PCR (qRT ‑PCR).  RNAs were isolated from
each well at day 5 after lentiviral infection with the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit and 200 ng were reverse transcribed with AMV RT (Finnzymes). cDNA (1/10th) was used for each PCR reaction, performed with SYBRgreen (Thermo Scientific) on ABI PRISM 7900 real-time thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences for each gene were either retrieved from Primer Bank (http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/) or designed using Primer3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi). Cycle thresholds (Ct) were normalized to Ct of GAPDH and fold enrichments were calculated as compared with the values from control shRNA-transduced cells.Exosome purification.  Cells were cultured in ‘exosome-depleted medium’ (com -plete medium depleted of FCS-derived exosomes by overnight centrifugation at 100,000 g) for 48  h and exosomes were purified by filtration on 0.22-μm pore filters, followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g as described previously24. In
each exosome preparation, the concentration of total proteins was quantified by Bradford assay (BioRad).Electron microscopy.  Exosomes fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde were loaded on Formwar/carbon-coated electron microscopy grids. Samples were post-fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde, contrasted and embedded as described previously5. For immunolabelling, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.2  M phosphate buffer at pH  7.4 and processed for ultrathin sectioning and immunolabelling with the indicated antibodies and protein A coupled to 10- or 15-nm gold particles (Cell Microscopy Center) as described previously5. Sections were observed at 80kV with a CM120 Twin Philipps electron microscope (FEI Company) and digital acquisitions were made with a numeric camera (Keen View; Soft Imaging system). Quantification of the surface of MVBs was performed on at least 40 CD63-positive multivesicular compartments present in randomly taken pictures,
analysed using iTelectron microscopy software (Olympus).Immunoblotting.  Cells were lysed in 50  mM Tris at pH  7.5, 0.3  M NaCl, 0.5% Triton X -100 and 0.1% sodium azide, with a cocktail of antiproteases (Roche), and cleared from nuclei by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 5  min. Protein extracts were separated on 4–12% SDS–PAGE, blotted on Immobilon (Millipore), and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were revealed using chemoluminescence substrate (Roche). Images were acquired using Chemidoc XRS (BioRad), intensity of the bands was quantified using QuantityOne software (Biorad) and results were expressed as a ratio to control cells.Flow cytometry.  For surface labelling, cells were stained with antibodies diluted in PBS -0.5% BSA on ice. For intracellular  + surface staining, cells fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde were quenched with PBS -0.1 M glycine, permea -bilized using PermWash reagent (BD), and stained with antibodies diluted in
permeabilization buffer. Cells were acquired on a FACScalibur and analysed using FlowJo software.Immunofluorescence microscopy.  Cells (1  × 105) were seeded on glass cov-
permeabilization buffer. Cells were acquired on a FACScalibur and analysed using FlowJo software.Immunofluorescence microscopy.  Cells (1  × 105) were seeded on glass cov-erslips for 18  h, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, quenched with 0.1  M glycine, permeabilized in PBS -0.2% BSA -0.05% saponin, and incubated with primary and secondary fluorescent antibodies. The coverslips mounted with Fluoromount -G (Southern Biotechnology Associates) were examined under a motorized upright wide-field microscope (Leica DMRA2) equipped for image deconvolution. Acquisition was performed using a ×100 objective (PL APO HCX, 1.4  NA) and a high-sensitive cooled interlined CCD camera (Roper CoolSnap HQ). z-position -ing was accomplished by a piezo-electric motor (LVDT, Physik Instrument) and a z-series of images was taken (an image every 0.2  μm). Images were acquired with Metamorph Software. Vesicle sizes were calculated with the Multidimensional
Image Analysis (MIA) interface based on wavelet decomposition48, running under MetaMorph (Universal Imaging Corporation). Briefly, fluorescent objects corre -sponding to MVEs were detected as fluctuations that were 20-fold larger than the noise. The watershed function was routinely applied to precisely detect individual structures in dense regions. The diameter of each structure was calculated from the sum of pixels assuming a spherical shape. Alternatively, images were acquired with Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM Axivert 720) using 6 3  × 1.4 NA oil immer -sion objective. Image acquisition and analysis were performed in the PICT IbiSA Imaging Facility (Curie Institute).

METHODS DOI: 10.1038/ncb2000in Figs  4b, 5a, 7f and 8a were adjusted for better visualization according to Nature Cell Biology  guidelines for the presentation of digital data.Quantification of asymmetrical distribution of CD63-positive vesicles was performed manually in a double-blind setting. Asymmetry was defined as a concentration of the CD63-staining in one side of the nucleus (covering less than 50% of the nucleus diameter).Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy.  B6H4 cells stably expressing shRNA were transfected with a GFP–CD63-encoding plasmid 36  h before analysis by TIRF microscopy. TIRF imaging was performed on a custom setup as described previously26. The penetration depth (δ)  of the evanescent field used to excite the fluorophore was set to 150  nm. Frames were acquired at 10 Hz in stacks of 450 images with an exposure time of 100  ms. One pixel cor -responds to 107.5  nm. The density of GFP–CD63 structures was evaluated using
MIA software48. The quantification was performed on regions devoid of TGN-like labelling and expressed as the number of observed CD63-positive structures divided by the size of the cell footprint. From stacks of images, two -dimensional (x, y) trajectories were obtained by single particle tracking using MIA software. Mean square displacement (MSD) in the x, y plane was calculated as described previously25,49. The diffusion coefficient Dxy was then calculated as Dxy = s/4, s being the slope of the linear fit of the first 15 points of the MSD curve. To meas -ure Dxy variations along a given trajectory, a rolling analysis window of 2.5  s was used as described previously25. Using this method, a Dxy value was attributed to each point of the trajectory. Immobilization periods correspond to portions of trajectories during which Dxy < 3 × 10–4 μm2 s–1. Survival curves for immobilization times (that is, the number of events per trajectory lasting at least the indicated
immobilization time) were computed for each cell and averaged over the differ -ent cells. The best fit for the curves was obtained with the sum of 2 exponentials, fN(t)  = N1 exp(–t/τ1) + N2 exp(–t/τ2), using SigmaPlot (Systat Software). N1 and N2 represent the abundance of each component and τ1 and τ2, their time constants. Portions of trajectories showing directed motion were detected by inspection of x vs t and y vs t plots and selected using locally written routines (MatLab, The MathWorks). Frame-to-frame rates of movement were calculated and averaged over each period of directed motion.Statistical analyses.  Data were analysed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). Normality of the data was tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Based on the normality test, either one-way ANOV A followed by Tukey’s post test or Kruskal Wallis followed by Dunn’s post test were used for multiple comparison
analyses. Values are given as mean  ± s.d. in all figures except Fig.  6 where values are mean ±  s.e.m.42. Stumptner ‑Cuvelette, P.  et al.

Dendritic cells were differentiated from bone marrow precursors in the presence of GM-CSF. At day 10 after the onset of culture, cells were cultured in exosome-depleted medium for 24h, before collection of supernatant and purification of exosomes by ultracentrifugation. WT and Rab27a/b-KO cells contained more than 75% of BMDCs, and less than 10% of mature BMDCs, as assessed by FACS staining for CD11c, Gr1, MHC Class II. Purified exosomes secreted by equal amounts of control or KO cells were analysed by immunoblotting for presence of CD9, tsg101, MFG-E8, MHC class II, and gp96 proteins.
