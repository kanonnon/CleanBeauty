A substantial quantity of the availableknowledge has only been uncovered in recent years, and we are learning that donor cells release nanovesicles,known as exosomes, which regulate the cellular behavior of recipient cells following uptake. Based on theimpressive capacity of exosomes in delivering their “payload ”,d iﬀerent therapeutic agents, are currently being
tested using this delivery method for more eﬀ ective therapy. This review summarizes the most recent devel-opments in exosome bioactivities and discusses the biochemical nature of exosomes and their biogenesis. It alsosummarizes the use of exosomes as delivery vehicles for drugs and natural compounds to the targeted site.1. IntroductionCells release a range of extracellular vesicles (EVs), either as a re-action to speci ﬁc stimuli, or as part of normal physiological conditions.These are derived from the endosomal pathway or the plasma mem-brane, and can be categorized according to their dimensions and cel-lular origin. Apoptotic bodies are fragments left by dying cells and havea diameter ranging from 1000 to 5000 nm. Microvesicles, also known asectosomes, originate from budding cellular membranes and have a sizeof 200 –1000 nm. Exosomes are the smallest EVs, with a diameter of30–150 nm, and have an endosomal origin ( Marote et al., 2016;
McGough and Vincent, 2016; Whiteside, 2016 ). What's common amongEVs is their role as carriers of molecular information as part of cell-to-cell communication, transferring cargo molecules involved in bothphysiological and pathological processes from parent to recipient cells(Bang and Thum, 2012; Kalluri, 2016; Schorey and Bhatnagar, 2008 ).This intercellular traﬃ cking can be addressed to neighboring cells, as aform of paracrine signaling, and/or to distant cells, acting as a type ofendocrine signaling. This is possible due to the presence of a speci ﬁcmolecule signature on their surfaces which makes them capable oftargeting recipient cells in a very particular way. In addition, the ubi-quitous presence of exosomes in all body ﬂuids reveals their stability inextracellular environments and also explains their potential for endo-crine communication. Clinical interest in these vesicles has recentlyemerged, due to their potential use in diagnostic applications and as

emerged, due to their potential use in diagnostic applications and aspart of new therapeutic strategies. Exosomes represent ideal bio-markers, in fact, aside from their presence in all body ﬂuids, whichmakes their analysis cheap and minimally invasive, they carry in-formation speci ﬁc to their progenitor cells ful ﬁlling the prerequisite ofspeciﬁcity ( Stremersch et al., 2016).Considerable attention has recently been focused on natural com-pounds with health bene ﬁts (Marchese et al., 2016a; Marchese et al.,2016b; Nabavi et al., 2015; Russo et al., 2016 ).

cancer ( Estruch et al., 2013; Orhan et al., 2015; Pazoki-Toroudi et al.,2016; Tangney and Rasmussen, 2013 ). In addition, several epidemio-logical studies have also shown that a high consumption of fruit andvegetables, which contain high concentrations of naturally bioactivecompounds, can prevent a number of non-communicable diseases suchas cancer, Alzheimer's disease, etc. ( Dai et al., 2006; Loef and Walach,2012; Rodriguez-Casado, 2016; Zuniga et al., 2016 ). This phenomenonled to an upsurge in scienti ﬁc studies aimed at ﬁnding novel bioactivenatural compounds with high e ﬃcacy and low side e ﬀects. This reviewaims to summarize the available evidence on the biofunctional roles ofexosomes and their potential use as delivery systems for natural com-pounds.2. Exosome biogenesisExosomes are generated from late endosomes which subsequentlyform multivesicular bodies (MVBs) through a number of di ﬀerentpathways. The most characterized pathway that relies on endosomal-
sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT), which recognizesubiquitylated proteins, while others may involve sphingomyelinases(Trajkovic et al., 2008 ), sphingosine-1-phosphate, and tetraspanin-en-riched domains ( Brinton et al., 2015). There are four ESCRT complexes,numbered from 0 to 3, which are composed of many proteins able torecognize ubiquitinated cargoes. The subunits of the ESCRT-0 complexrecruit proteins for internalization, such as ubiquitinated proteins andclathrin. ESCRT -1 and 2 determine the beginning of the budding pro-cess and promote the enzymatic de-ubiquitination of cargo proteinsbefore the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), which group toform larger membranous vesicles called MVBs in the intracellularcompartment. The ESCRT-3 complex drives the ﬁnal stage of membraneinvagination and separation ( Ha et al., 2016; McGough and Vincent,2016 ). Depletion of ESCRT complexes has been found to cause a
modulation in the formation of MVBs but not their complete absence,suggesting the presence of independent mechanisms. In fact, it has beendemonstrated that both ceramide-rich lipid domains and tetraspaninCD63 on the extracellular side of the membrane, lead to ILV formation(Colombo et al., 2013). MVBs may undergo di ﬀerent processes in thecell, and can merge either with lysosomes, which degrades their con-tents, or with the plasma membrane, which releases exosomes from thecell. This mechanism involves many proteins such as clathrin, coatprotein complex I and II (COPI and II), soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sen-sitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs), and GTPases ( Caiet al., 2007 ). RNA interference-mediated knockdown of RAB27, SLP4and SLAC2B has been shown to negatively in ﬂuence exosome release,showing that these proteins play crucial roles in the secretion of exo-somes ( Ostrowski et al., 2010).3. Exosome composition and transfer
3. Exosome composition and transferThe composition of the exosome bilayer re ﬂects the moleculespresent in the membrane of its parent cells and allows for discrimina-tion between exosomes derived from di ﬀerent cells, whether these arenormal or pathological ( Théry et al., 2009 ). Of the proteins commonlypresent on their surface, the most abundant are adhesion moleculesbelonging to the tetraspanin and integrin families as shown in Fig. 1.The tetraspanin family are membrane-crossing proteins and usuallyassociate with one another to form tetraspanin membrane domain, orwith neighboring proteins like integrins. Speci ﬁc tetraspanins, such asCD9, CD63, CD81 and CD82, regulate the mechanisms of fusion, mi-gration and adhesion to target cells. The expression patterns of thesetetraspanins/integrins regulate a variety of biological functions actingas adhesion molecules, including migration, adhesion and proliferation,
as well as mediating the interaction between exosomes and recipientcells.Moreover, the major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) may
as well as mediating the interaction between exosomes and recipientcells.Moreover, the major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) maybe present, promoting certain T-cell speci ﬁc responses ( Batrakova andKim, 2015 ). Tumor derived exosomes (TDEs) have a di ﬀerentmembrane composition to exosomes derived from normal cells. In fact,prostate cancer cells have been shown to release vesicles characterizedby the presence of αvβ6integrin, which is horizontally transferred totarget cells, promoting cell-migration and metastasis ( Fedele et al.,2015 ). Other integrins have been associated with exosome-mediatedmetastatic processes, such as α6β4andα6β1for lung, and αvβ5for livermetastasis ( Hoshino et al., 2015 ). Other protein molecules have beenfound bound to lipid fractions on exosomes, and are related to transportand fusion functions, such as annexins, ﬂotillin, GTPases, RABs andADP ribosylation factors (ARFs) ( Colombo et al., 2014 ). The lipid
composition of exosomal membranes depends on the parent cell plasmamembrane type, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines,phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylinositols, sphingomyelins, lysobis-phosphatidic acid (bis-monoacylglycerol phosphate), phosphatidicacid, lysophosphatidylcholines, cholesterol, ceramide and phosphogli-cerides have been found in these membranes ( Subra et al., 2007). Theintraluminal composition of the exosomal membrane depends on theparent cells, and on their cytoplasmatic content in particular. Heatshock proteins (i.e. Hsp90 and Hsp70), cytoskeletal proteins (i.e. actin,tubulin, co ﬁlin), lipids and enzymes, along with RNAs, such as miRNAs(microRNAs), mRNAs, and other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have beenfound in the exosomal lumen, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) andsingle strand DNA (ssDNA) have been detected more recently ( Guesciniet al., 2010 ). When exosomes fuse with recipient cells, they release their
content into the cytoplasmatic space, allowing for the horizontaltransfer of their cargo. The uptake of the exosomes by the receptor cellsis a very energy-dependent active process. Basically, it is receptor-mediated endocytosis in which exosomal membrane proteins and lipids,such as tetraspanins and phosphatidylserine, interact with the com-plementary molecules found on the plasma membranes of cells and aresubsequently internalized ( Escrevente et al., 2011; Morelli et al., 2004).The molecular signals carried by exosomes and/or their uptake bytarget cells can be triggered 1) through the direct interaction of a re-ceptor with its ligand, 2) through adhesion molecules (i.e. integrins,ICAMs) which induce fusion and endocytosis, and 3) through thephagocytosis of opsonized exosomes ( Whiteside, 2016 ).4. Puri ﬁcation of exosomesDiﬀerent methods have been developed for extracting exosomesfrom cell culture media or biological ﬂuids. The most common methods
involve subsequent centrifugation steps, ﬁnishing with ultra-centrifugation at 100,000 × g, for a variable period (2 –5 h). The dis-advantages of this strategy are its length and the high viscosity of thestarting samples, which negatively a ﬀect the yield. Another techniqueinvolves sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, which allows theexosomal fraction to be puriﬁ ed further. Precipitation is also used,though this method presents poor speci ﬁcity. Many commercial kitshave been developed to take advantage of this technique. Size exclusionchromatography provides a high yield of isolated exosomes, main-taining their function. A ﬁltration process can also be used to obtainexosomes and is primarily applied as a preparative method before othertechniques. The combination of di ﬀerent approaches is recommendedto increase the advantages and decrease the problems associated withsingle techniques ( Stremersch et al., 2016; Whiteside, 2016 ). The de-
to increase the advantages and decrease the problems associated withsingle techniques ( Stremersch et al., 2016; Whiteside, 2016 ). The de-terministic lateral displacement (DLD) pillar array technique has re-cently been used to separate exosomes, allowing for on-chip sorting inaddition to quanti ﬁcation ( Batrakova and Kim, 2015; Wunsch et al.,2016 ).5. Physiological and pathological functions of exosomesAfter their discovery, exosomes were thought to be vehicles re-sponsible for removing cell debris, such as redundant intracellular or-ganelles. However, after these vesicles were found to stimulate theimmune response, their importance in intracellular communication wasA.A. Farooqi et al. Biotechnology Advances 36 (2018) 328–334329
considered. Upon internalization, the recipient cell responds to thetransferred cargo, modulating its basal functions and gene expression.Exosomes can be found in all bodily ﬂuids, including saliva, breast milk,blood, synovial ﬂuid, amniotic ﬂuid, urine, sperm and follicular ﬂuid.They reach target cells by traveling through these body ﬂuids, ful ﬁllingtheir function as carriers of both physiological and pathological signals.Exosomes have exceptional capacity to interact with recipient cellsthrough adhesion proteins and vector ligands ( Franz et al., 2016; Piehlet al., 2013; Qin and Xu, 2014; Santonocito et al., 2014; Simpson et al.,2008 ). A variety of di ﬀerent types of cell may release exosomes to theextracellular medium under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Thefunctions of these released exosomes vary, and primarily depend on theorigin of the cell/tissue. For example exosomes shed by central nervous
system provide a means of communication between neural cells, as wellas getting rid of waste ( Frühbeis et al., 2013). In addition to mediatingthese vital brain functions, exosomes are involved in the pathogenesisof a range of neuroin ﬂammatory conditions ( Gupta and Pulliam, 2014 ).The role of exosomes as modulators of the immune system has drawngreat interest, and researchers have come up with several interestingﬁndings. Adaptive immunity and suppression of inﬂ ammation can betriggered depending on the status of the immune cells involved ( Théryet al., 2009). Exosomes were found to play an important role in themediation of adaptive and innate immune responses, taking part inantigen presentation, distributing antigens in a coordinated mannerwith MHC-II and MHC-I molecules ( Sun et al., 2013 ). Exosomes canconfer immune suppression through several mechanisms, for exampleenhancing the function of regulatory T cells, inhibiting monocyte dif-
ferentiation into dendritic cells (DCs), and suppressing natural killerand CD8+ activity ( Clayton et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2006 ). Exosomeshave been conversely found to activate the immune system, and thiscan be mediated by activation of NK cells, B cells and by survival ofhematopoietic cells. Exosomes derived from human B cells have beenshown to prompt an antigen-speci ﬁc MHC class II response. MHC class Iresponses and other co-stimulatory molecules have been expressed inDCs derived exosomes ( Ohno et al., 2013). Rejection of establishedtumors was observed by the initiation of the cytotoxic T cell responsewhen tumor antigen was presented by DCs derived exosomes ( Zitvogelet al., 1998). Tumor cells secrete 10 times more vesicles than normalcells, and it is assumed that this is the most e ﬃcient way for tumor andmetastatic information to be transferred to both normal and tumor cells(Shao et al., 2016 ). Zomer et al. ( 2015) demonstrated that the transfer
of tumor derived exosome (TDE) contents to non-malignant cellstriggers the activation of tumor phenotype and metastatic properties. Infact, TDEs play key roles in many tumor-associated events, such asmetastasis, migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, drug resistance andimmune suppression ( Shao et al., 2016 ). These signals can be propa-gated by di ﬀerent cargo molecules, such as miRNAs, transcripts andproteins. Many authors have demonstrated that TDEs contain the sig-natures of speci ﬁc oncogenic or tumor-suppressing miRNAs, with miR-200 and let-7 families as respective examples ( Kobayashi et al., 2014).6. Use of exosomes as new delivery systems6.1.Advantages of exosomes in respect to other nanoscale drug deliverysystemsDuring recent decades, several new nanoscale drug delivery systemshave been studied to increase the e ﬃcacy and circulation time of drugs,their speci ﬁcity to given targets and to reduce toxicity. The most in-
vestigated novel methods are based on natural and synthetic polymersor lipids ( Kotmakçı and Çetinta ş, 2015 ). Doxorubicin has been suc-
vestigated novel methods are based on natural and synthetic polymersor lipids ( Kotmakçı and Çetinta ş, 2015 ). Doxorubicin has been suc-cessfully encapsulated in liposomes (DoxilR), and paclitaxel has beenencapsulated in protein-based nanoparticles (AbraxaneR) ( Liu et al.,2016 ). Even though these liposomes possess good qualities as deliveryvehicles, such as incorporation of both hydrophilic and hydrophobicdrugs, and membrane penetration, they still possess some inherentdisadvantages in the form of lower circulating stability, rapid clearanceby phagocytosis, and increased toxicity ( Ha et al., 2016). PEGylation ofthese particles can increase their circulation time, but the downside isthe decreased biodistribution of drugs in diseased tissues, due to thepossible hindrance of interaction between the system and target cells(Suk et al., 2016). The clearance of these PEGylated liposomes is sig-niﬁcantly increased by an emergent immune response to PEG, with
approximately one quarter of blood donations containing antibodiesagainst PEG from previous exposure ( Armstrong et al., 2007; Batrakovaand Kim, 2015 ). In this respect, exosomes can be ideal nanocarriers fordrugs due to their overall biocompatibility and reduced toxicity. Theadvantages of using them as vehicles include good tolerance due totheir ubiquitous presence and similarity in structure and composition tocell membranes ( Bang and Thum, 2012 ). Exosomes can penetrate deepin tissues and evade the immune system, good characteristics whichallow them to deliver their therapeutic cargo directly to the cellularcompartment. Exosomes from DCs were able to transfer peptide loadedMHC class I & II complexes to modulate cell response. Some exosomesFig. 1. Structural composition of exosomes.A.A. Farooqi et al. Biotechnology Advances 36 (2018) 328–334330
are also capable of evading the immune system due to their size ( Hood,2016 ). Exosomes can seek out target tissues, making them ideal fortargeting speci ﬁc organs and tissues. Hood et al. demonstrated thisintrinsic ability to home in on targets by showing the way in whichmelanoma exosomes target sentinel lymph nodes ( Hood et al., 2011 ).Amenability to membrane modi ﬁcation can be a highly desirableattribute especially when targeting a speci ﬁc cell type. The develop-ment strategy for targeted exosome-based delivery systems is based onthe use of cell strains engineered with special plasmid vectors thatencode fusion proteins. Fusion proteins basically consist of an extra-vesicle transmembrane domain and a targeting domain.6.2. Delivery of drugsTian et al. ( 2014 ) engineered mouse immature dendritic cells usingprotein (Lamp2b) fused to αv integrin-speci ﬁc iRGD peptide. ImmatureDCs (imDCs) were chosen to produce the necessary exosomes to reduce
immunogenicity and toxicity, as these cells are devoid of T-cell acti-vators like MHC I, II and CD 86. The resulting exosomes were loadedwith doxorubicin and were capable of targeting αv integrin expressingcancer cells. The imDCs were engineered to express exosomal mem-brane protein (Lamp2b) fused to αv integrin-speci ﬁc iRGD peptide, thustargeting tumors. The study reported signi ﬁcantly lower cardiotoxicityand higher antitumor activity when compared to the free drug ( Tianet al., 2014).The blood brain barrier (BBB) restricts delivery of therapeuticagents to the brain. It is composed of densely packed endothelial cellsthat provide a physical and biochemical barrier that prevents the entryof toxic compounds into the brain, preserving homeostasis. It also re-stricts the delivery of most drugs. In a recent study, exosomes derivedfrom brain cells that expressed brain speci ﬁc surface proteins, which
allowed them to pass through the BBB and deliver drugs on the otherside, were investigated. Exosomes isolated from brain endothelial cellline bEND.3 were loaded with rhodamine, doxorubicin or paclitaxelthrough mixing and incubation. When these exosomes were adminis-tered to glioblastoma cell, all the three agents were delivered to thecells. However, the exosomes loaded with doxorubicin showed higheractivity than paclitaxel. The study further reports that a signi ﬁcantreduction in tumor size in the brain of zebra ﬁsh was observed, alongwith the inhibition of VEGF for the group that received exosomeformulation, compared to the free drug group ( Yang et al., 2015 ).Exosomes separated from bovine milk were isolated using di ﬀer-ential centrifugation. Then they were loaded with chemopreventiveagent withaferin A and used against breast and lung cancer models.Two formulations were administered intraperitoneally to mice, the ﬁrst
one only containing withaferin and other with exosomal withaferin. Asigniﬁcant higher e ﬃcacy was observed with the drug loaded intoexosomal formulation than with the free drug. The authors also re-ported good tolerance of the milk exosomes, with no adverse in-ﬂammatory or immune events observed ( Munagala et al., 2016 ).6.3. Delivery of protein and small RNAsParkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition, one ofthe quickest growing in developed countries, and often linked to mi-croglia activation brain in ﬂammation, and neurotoxic secretory ac-tivity, including increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidativestress and neudegeneration in PD may be attributed to decreasing cat-alase, redox enzymes and other antioxidants, and hence the delivery ofpotent antioxidant catalase can be instrumental in therapy. Haney et al.foundthat exosomes produced by monocytes and macrophages avoid
entrapment in mononuclear phagocytes and further facilitate the de-livery of incorporated drugs to the targeted cells of the neurovascularunit, ultimately increasing therapeutic e ﬃcacy of the drugs. The au-
unit, ultimately increasing therapeutic e ﬃcacy of the drugs. The au-thors used several methods ex vivo to incorporate catalase (MW 240 K)into exosomes. Following intranasal administration, the study reportedsigniﬁcant amount of catalase in the brain of PD mouse. The ExoCATformulation interacted with target cells, delivering the payload to theneighboring neurons and providing signi ﬁcant levels of neuroprotec-tion in the model used ( Haney et al., 2015).Another study in this direction was conducted by Alvarez-Erviti andcoworkers, in which they genetically engineered DCs obtained frommice by fusing the well-characterized exosomal membrane proteinLamp2b to neurospeci ﬁc peptide RVG, as shown in Fig. 2. Exosomesproduced by these cells expressed RVG peptides on their surface whichprovided active targeting towards neuronal cells in the brain. WhensiRNA against BACE1, which is involved in the formation of plaque in
Alzheimer's disease, was loaded in the exosomes, di ﬀerent parts of thebrain showed speci ﬁc gene silencing activity in the targeted neurons invivo ( Alvarez-Erviti et al., 2011 ).Fig. 2. Design of targeted exosomes. Exosomal surfaceprotein Lamp2b (blue) is fused with RVG (red).

Ohno et al. ( 2013 ) successfully targeted breast cancer cells thatwere overexpressing EGFR by using exosomes loaded with miRNA en-gineered using human embryonic kidney cells, expressing a trans-membrane domain of platelet-derived growth factor receptors, fusedeither to epidermal growth factor receptor-binding peptides (GE11) orepidermal growth factors (EGF) ( Ohno et al., 2013 ).Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a cancer of the central nervoussystem, and is the most widespread and lethal of this kind. It resistsalkylating agents and antineoplastic treatments due to upregulatedadenosine triphosphate –binding cassette drug e ﬄux pumps.Chemoresistance and functional drug e ﬄux can be regulated by the useof microRNAs (miRs). Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells(MSC) were investigated for providing GBM cells with functional anti-miR-9. The authors reported intracellular transfers between MSC andGBM cells. Delivering anti-miR-9 to resistant GBM cells was able to
reverse the expression of the multidrug transporter, sensitizing thesecells to temozolomide (TMZ), as demonstrated by increases in the ac-tivity of caspase and the death of the cells. The authors reported thatinhibition of miR-9 by anti-miR decreases the expression of the drugtransporter gene MDR1, leading to an increased sensitivity of the GBMcells towards TMZ ( Munoz et al., 2013 ).Exosomes can be used for anticancer vaccines to elicit immune re-sponses via MHC class I and II molecules on CD8+ or CD4+ T cells, orthrough Mart1 pathway in patients with high-grade melanoma, or viathe NK cell response ( Inamdar et al., 2017). Several clinical trialsaround the world are in Phase I and II of testing on cancer patients, andthe results look promising ( Vlassov et al., 2012 ).6.4. Delivery of natural compoundsNatural agents, such as dietary polyphenols, are able to modulatethe content and therefore the function of exosomes. In 2007, Zhang
et al. ( 2007 ) studied the e ﬀects of six di ﬀerent polyphenols (i.e. cur-cumin, genistein, quercetin, calycosin, biochanin and baicalein) on therestoration of the cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells, inhibited bymouse mammary tumor exosomes. Turmeric exerts a wide range ofbioactivities such as antioxidant, anti-protozoal, anti-venom activities,anti-microbial, anti-malarial, anti-in ﬂammatory, anti-proliferative,anti-angiogenic, anti-tumor and anti-aging properties ( Amalraj et al.,2017 ). TS/A tumor cells have been treated with genistein, curcumin,and baicalein reverting the suppression of the NK cells' cytotoxicity at adose of 1 μM, and curcumin was found to provide the strongest re-storative e ﬀect on NK cell function. Moreover, a wide range of cur-cumin concentrations yielded a concentration-dependent increase inNK activity, down to concentrations as low as 200 nM. Furthermore,curcumin treatments were found to reduce inhibition of p-Stat5 and
Jak3 in NK cells, as shown in Fig. 3 . This mechanism could be the basisof curcumin's capacity to promote NK cytotoxicity. In 2011, Zhuanget al. ( 2011 ) delivered curcumin-loaded exosomes through a nasalroute, and studied their e ﬀects on in ﬂammatory diseases of the brain.They induced microglia in ﬂammation, treating mice with lipopoly-saccharide (LPS) and then immediately administering curcumin-loadedexosomes. The numbers of in ﬂamed microglial cells were found to bereduced after 2 h, along with an increase in apoptotic events comparedto a control group. They also demonstrated that intranasal adminis-tration of exosomes containing curcumin reduced inﬂ ammation-in-duced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice. Exosomesloaded with curcumin (CUR-EXO) were also active in mitigating brainendothelial cell dysfunction. Kalani et al. ( 2014 )treated mouse brainendothelial cells with 7.5 μmol/L of curcumin, isolating exosomes after
endothelial cell dysfunction. Kalani et al. ( 2014 )treated mouse brainendothelial cells with 7.5 μmol/L of curcumin, isolating exosomes after72 h. Subsequently, endothelial cells were cultured in the presence ofhomocysteine, an agent capable of disrupting the blood brain barrier, orwith both homocysteine and CUR-EXO. The results showed decreasedoxidative stress for the samples co-treated with CUR-EXO. The coupledtreatment was also found to increase claudin-5, occludin, ZO-1 and VE-chaderin levels, which have pivotal roles in the integrity of cerebraltight and adherent junctions. The activation of metalloproteinases(MMPs) is another sign of toxicity induced by homocysteine. It has beendemonstrated that while homocysteine promotes the activity of MMP-9,curcumin primed exosomes normalize its activity. Osterman et al.(2015 ) found that curcumin loaded exosomes from pancreatic cancer
cells induced apoptosis in recipient pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells,while curcumin negative exosomes increased the viability of thesecancer cells.6.5. Exosome cargo modi ﬁed by natural compoundsCafrán-Duque et al. ( 2014) showed that HepG2 and THP-1 cellspreviously treated with U18666A increased their release of both exo-somes and microvesicles when treated with curcumin at a concentra-tion of 30 μM, ameliorating intracellular cholesterol traﬃ c. They alsostudied the e ﬀects of curcumin on intracellular lipid accumulationcaused by ﬁrst and second generation antipsychotics. The resultsshowed that curcumin decreased the content of lipids within the celland that HepG2 cells, previously treated with antipsychotics, increasedtheir secretion of cholesterol rich exosomes. Curcumin could thus beused as an adjuvant therapy to alleviate negative metabolic e ﬀects re-lated to antipsychotic treatments ( Canfrán-Duque et al., 2015). Taverna
et al. ( 2016) suggested that curcumin inhibits the growth of chronicmyelogenous leukemia (CML) cells through exosomal disposal of on-cogenic miR-21. In fact, the intracellular levels of this miRNA decreasedafter 24 h treatment with 20 and 40 μmol/L of curcumin, while theyincreased in exosomes released to the culture medium. The intracellularreduction of miR-21 causes up-regulation of PTEN, a tumor suppressorprotein, which is then able to antagonize the oncogenic pathway PI3K-AKT. In 2016, the same authors showed that the treatment of HUVECcells with curcumin loaded exosomes derived from CML cells atte-nuated the motility and angiogenic properties of the endothelial cells.Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the stabilization of celljunctions and vascular integrity is promoted by a decrease in expressionlevels of MARKS protein, one of the targets of miR-21 ( Taverna et al.,2016 ). Treatment of breast cancer cells with docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA) leads to increased small RNA exosomal content and the secretionof exosomal vesicles. Furthermore, the results showed that the DHAFig. 3. Curcumin mediated increase in the phosphorylated STAT5.A.A. Farooqi et al. Biotechnology Advances 36 (2018) 328–334332
positive exosomes secreted were able to suppress tumor angiogenesisdue to the content of microRNAs directed against pro-angiogeneticmRNAs, such as those coding for plasminogen activators, angiomotinlike-1, neutropilin 1 and v-est avian erythroblastosis virus E26 onco-gene homolog ( Hannafon et al., 2015). Jang et al. ( 2013) found thatexosomes from murine breast cancer cells treated with tea polyphenolepigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) induce a decrease in CSF-1 and CCL2,two growth factors for tumors promoting associated macrophages (M2).In addition, they promote the induction of the tumor inhibiting mac-rophages phenotype (M1). The molecular mechanism underlying thisphenotype change is thought to be the up-regulation of miR-16 inexosomes after EGCG treatment, which in turn results in the negativeregulation of nuclear factor- κB pathway frequently active in many in-ﬂammatory processes and cancers ( Karin, 2009).7. Conclusion
7. ConclusionRecent breakthroughs made in the delivery of payloads by exosomeshave attracted considerable attention of researchers worldwide. Thereis increasing evidence supporting the role of exosomes as a reliabledelivery system. Several proof of concept studies have engineeredexosomes to target speci ﬁc cells and organs, delivering appropriatetherapeutic agents. The great variability of the substances that can beloaded into exosomes and their unique properties, due to their bio-genesis, makes exosomes powerful drug delivery vehicles. Nevertheless,to create a commercial exosomal drug delivery system that is superiorto synthetic carriers, several complexities and obstacles have to beovercome. Some of the issues that needs to be considered for thetherapeutic use of the exosomes include the procedure for their loading,selection of exosomes sources, improvement in puri ﬁcation, use of
targeting peptides, stability of loaded agents and the formulation,pharmacokinetic properties and e ﬀects of modi ﬁcation of the exosomesurface. In particular, the methods to load exosome with the desiredcargo, constitutes a key point for the therapeutic success. There arediﬀerent methods that can be applied and they could vary on the basisof the chemical/physical characteristic of the therapeutic cargo. Amongdiﬀerent methods, there are electroporation, chemical-based transfec-tion, transfection of the cell that will produce exosomes and the simpleincubation of the exosomes with the molecule chose as cargo. As far ascurcumin is concerned, given its lipophilic and low molecular weight, itis suﬃcient to co-incubate exosomes at room temperature to promotethe loading. Nevertheless, speci ﬁc studies focused on the procedure forthe loading into exosomes of other phytochemicals have to be per-formed.In conclusion, considering that phytochemicals have emerged as
eﬀective anticancer agents, and many natural products are currentlybeing evaluated for e ﬃcacy and are in various phases of clinical trials,exosomes could be considered as remarkable delivery vehicles for thesephytochemicals.ReferencesAlvarez-Erviti, L., Seow, Y., Yin, H., Betts, C., Lakhal, S., Wood, M.J., 2011.
