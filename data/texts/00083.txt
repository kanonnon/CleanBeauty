Spallanzani”, Univer sity ofPavia, Pavia, ItalySummary Background Human skin aging is a multifactorial and complex biological process
affecting the different skin constituents. Even if the skin aging mechanism is not yetfully unravelled is evident that epidermis loses the principal molecule responsible forbinding and retaining water molecules, resulting in loss of skin moisture andaccounting for some of the most striking alterations of the aged skin.Objectives This Study investigated the cosmetic ﬁlling efﬁcacy of Fillerina/C226indecreasing the skin aging signs and in improving facial volume deﬁciencies.Methods A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial was carried outon 40 healthy female subjects showing mild to moderate clinical signs of skin aging.The effect of the treatment on skin surface and on face volumes was assessed both inthe short-term (3 h after a single product application) and in the long-term (7, 14,and 30 days after continuative daily use).Results Three hours after a single application and after 7, 14, and 30 days of treatment
the lips volume was increased by 8.5%, 11.3%, 12.8%, and 14.2%. After 7, 14, and30 days: (1) skin sagging of the face contours was decreased by /C00.443 /C60.286,/C01.124 /C60.511, and /C01.326 /C60.649 mm, respectively; (2) skin sagging of thecheekbones contours was decreased by /C00.989 /C60.585, /C02.500 /C60.929, and/C02.517 /C60.927 mm, respectively; (3) cheekbones volume was increased by0.875 /C60.519, 2.186 /C60.781, and 2.275 /C60.725 mm, respectively; (4) wrinklevolume was decreased by /C011.3%, /C018.4%, and /C026.3%, respectively; and (5) wrinkledepth was decreased by /C08.4%,/C014.5%, and /C021.8% respectively.Conclusion This study demonstrated the positive ﬁlling effect of Fillerina/C226indecreasing the clinical signs of skin aging and in improving the face volumes.Keywords : anti-aging, face volumes, hyaluronic acid, skin aging, skin wrinklesIntroductionHuman skin aging is a multifactorial and complex bio-

cess, which affects the skin in the same way as itaffects all others organs. The second is extrinsic aging,which is the result of exposure to environmental fac-tors (i.e. ultraviolet irradiation, pollutants, etc.) and itis commonly referred to as photoaging.1In elderly the skin turgor, resilience, and pliabilityare decreased, presumably due to altered patterns andlevels of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), especially hyal-uronic acid (HA) and dermatan sulfate, which are themost common.2HA is a nonsulfated GAG with anunique capacity to bind and retain water molecules.3Chemically, HA is composed of repeating polymericdisaccharides of D-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl- D-glucosamine linked by a glucuronidic b(1?3)bond.4,5Unlike other GAG, HA is not covalentlylinked to a protein core, but it may form aggregateswith proteoglycans.6HA polymers occur in a largenumber of conﬁgurations and shapes, depending ontheir size, salt concentration, pH, and associatedcations.7
7HA is widely distributed, from prokaryotic8,9toeukaryotic cells.10In humans, HA is most abundantin the skin,11–15accounting for the 50% of the totalbody HA.16HA is produced primarily by mesenchymalcells, even if other cell types are capable to produceHA.17–21The use of biotinylated HA-binding peptiderevealed that not only cells of mesenchymal origin arecapable of synthesizing HA and permitted the histolo-calization of HA in the dermal compartment of skinand the epidermis.22–24This technique enabled thevisualization of HA in the epidermis, mainly in theextracellular matrix molecules (ECM) of the upper spi-nous and granular layers, whereas in the basal layerHA is predominantly intracellular.12HA has a dynamic turnover rate with a half-life lessthan a day in the skin and it is degraded into frag-ments of varying size by hyaluronidases (HYAL) byhydrolyzing the hexosaminidic b(1–4) linkagesbetween N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-glucuronic acidresidues in HA.25
25The most dramatic histochemical change observedin senescent skin is the marked disappearance of epi-dermal HA. With increasing aging, a steady declineof HA occurs in the upper epidermal layer, with con-comitant increases in the basal layer of the epidermisand the upper portions of the papillary dermis, whileat senescence HA is entirely absent in the epidermisand present in the upper dermis.26The reasons forthis change in HA homeostasis with aging isunknown. Progressive reduction of the size of the HApolymers in skin as a result of aging has also beenreported.22In the skin photoaging were also reported an abnor-mal GAG content and distribution and a diminishedHA concentration.27Using photoexposed and photo-protected human skin tissue specimens, obtained fromthe same patient, a signiﬁcant increase in the expres-
sion of HA of lower molecular mass in photoexposedskin, as compared with photoprotected skin wasreported, suggesting that HA homeostasis exhibits adistinct proﬁle in intrinsic skin aging, which is totallydifferent from the characteristic proﬁle in extrinsic skinaging.28Even if the mechanism of skin aging is not yet fullyunravelled is evident that during aging the epidermisloses the principal molecule responsible for binding andretaining water molecules, resulting in loss of skinmoisture and accounting for some of the most strikingalterations of the aged skin, including decreased turgid-ity, less support for microvessels, wrinkling, alteredelasticity and loss of face volumes especially as regardsto the cheekbones and lips.2Currently, HA ﬁllers are an established interventionfor correcting facial volume deﬁciencies.29However,
they are costly, invasive, painful, and may have sideeffects. Thus, a topical, non-invasive, effective cosmetictreatment to replenish the skin with the lost HA couldbe more acceptable. The aim of the present study wasto evaluate the ﬁlling efﬁcacy of a commercially avail-able HA based dermocosmetic treatment (Fillerina/C226)

OutcomesThe primary endpoints with respect to efﬁcacy indecreasing the skin aging signs were the measurementsof skin sagging/loss of volume of face contours, cheek-bones, and lips by means of a morphometric imageanalysis technique (Fig. 2). Wrinkle volume and depthwere measured, in the periocular area (“crow’s feetarea”), as secondary endpoints by means of a 3D micro-topography imaging system. All the measurement werecarried out before study start (basal value) and after 7,14, and 30 days of treatment, except for lips volumeand wrinkles depth/volume, for which and additionalmeasurement time was foreseen 3 h after the ﬁrst prod-uct application at study start. The measurements werecarried out on cleansed skin (except for the lips volumeand the wrinkle depth/volume measurements 3 h afterproduct application) under temperature (22 /C62°C)and relative humidity (50 /C610%) controlled condi-tions. The treatment was stopped 8 –12 h before anyskin assessment were made.

(a) Face contour lifting effect is measured as the distance (red dottedlines) between the upper (forehead) and the lower (mandible) part of the face. The measurement is taken in the following points: (1)external side of the right eye, (2) internal side of the right eye, (3) nose apex, (4) internal side of the left eye, and (5) external side of the
left eye. (b) Cheekbones contour pumpling effect is measured as the distance between the line passing from the nose apex (1) and the cheek-bones contour upper (2) and lower (3) part. The measurement is taken in 5 points (red arrows). Cheekbones contour lifting effect is mea-sured as the distance between the line passing perpendicularly to the eyes (2) and the cheekbones contour. The measurement is takenin 3 points (green arrows).

A slight worseningwas seen in the placebo group by 0.151 /C60.125,0.157 /C60.153, and 0.112 /C60.145 mm at the 7, 14,and 30 days follow up visit, respectively. The decreaseof the upper to lower distance of face contours is indic-ative of a decrease of the skin sagging.The results of the cheekbones volumizing/plumpingeffect evaluation are reported in Table 3 and Figure 6.The baseline (Table 1) mean nose to cheekbones con-tours distance (measured in 5 points, see Fig. 1b) wassimilar between active (5.907 /C60.366 cm) and pla-cebo (6.094 /C60.433 cm) groups and not statisticallysigniﬁcant ( P>0.05). At the 7, 14, and 30 daysfollow up visit this distance is increased in the activegroup by 0.875 /C60.519, 2.186 /C60.781, and2.275 /C60.725 mm, respectively. A slight worseningwas seen in the placebo group by /C00.221 /C60.190,/C00.217 /C60.227, and /C00.230 /C60.268 mm at the 7,
14, and 30 days follow-up visit, respectively. Theincrease of the nose to cheekbones contours distance isindicative of more protruding cheekbones contours andincreased volume.The results of the cheekbones contour lifting evalua-tion are reported in Table 4 and Figure 7. The baselineeye to cheekbones contours distance (measured in 3points, see Fig. 1b) was similar between active(3.361 /C60.325 cm) and placebo (3.108 /C60.226 cm)groups and not statistically signiﬁcant ( P>0.05). Atthe 7, 14, and 30 days follow-up visit this distance isdecreased in the active group by /C00.989 /C60.585,/C02.500 /C60.929, and /C02.517 /C60.927 mm, respec-tively. A slight worsening was seen in the placebogroup by 0.199 /C60.122 0.241 /C60.153, and0.265 /C60.169 mm at the 7, 14, and 30 daysfollow-up visit, respectively. The decrease of the eye tocheekbones contours distance is indicative of adecrease of the skin sagging and an increase of cheek-bones volume.
The results of the treatment effect on lips volume arereported in Table 5 and Figure 8. The baseline meanvalue was similar between active (2.697 /C60.307 cm3) and placebo (2.620 /C60.250 cm3) groupsand not statistically signiﬁcant ( P>0.05).

The efﬁcacyof the product appeared to be greater in diminishingthe cheekbones skin sagging compared to face contourskin sagging. This relative responsiveness on differentsite could be related to the skin sagging severity, andto the extent of the two skin sites.A slight worsening of the skin sagging was seen inthe placebo group. This slight variation could be dueto normal variation of skin sagging.Chronoaged skin contains signiﬁcantly fewer levelsof hyaluronic acid26and hormone replacement treat-ment has demonstrated to increase HA concentra-tion.30The stratum corneum (SC) dryness has beenproposed to play an important role in wrinkle forma-tion.31Fine wrinkle appearance has been linked to thedryness of the SC and increased appearance of ﬁne

high humidity environments.32Moreover, SC waterholding capacity and elasticity decrease during chrono-logical aging.33Simple moisturization by occlusion,due to the higher molecular weight HAs contained inthe treatment used in this study, is likely to dampenthese responses. Occlusion could have also a beneﬁcialeffect in decreasing the proﬁbrotic signaling within thedermis.34Nevertheless, improvements in skin aging biology arealso expected by the low molecular weight HAs con-tained in the treatment used in the study. Topical appli-cation of low molecular weight HA was demonstratedto improve skin moisturization and elasticity associatedwith signiﬁcant reduction of wrinkle depth.35Irrespective of the potential mechanism of action, thisstudy provide the ﬁrst evidence that the use of six typeshyaluronic acid at different molecular weight(Fillerina/C226) is able to provide an improvement in the
