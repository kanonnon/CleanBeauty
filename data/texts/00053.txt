A proprietary herbal extract against hair loss in androgenetic alopecia and telogen effluvium: a placebo-controlled, single-blind, clinical-instrumental studyErkin Pekmezci1 ✉, Cihat Dündar2, Murat Türkoğlu21Department of Dermatology, Gözde Hospital, Malatya, Turkey. 2Biota Laboratories, R&D Center, Sancaktepe, Istanbul, Turkey. ✉ Corresponding author: erkinpekmezci@gmail.com512018;27:51-57 doi: 10.15570/actaapa.2018.13IntroductionAlthough hair loss is not a serious problem for general health, it is a matter of concern because it can lower self-confidence and cre -ate feelings of inferiority. In general, patients with alopecia have a higher incidence of psychiatric disorders such as depression, anx -iety, and social phobia compared to the rest of the population (1).Although androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is more prevalent in men, it is a widespread dermatological problem that also affects women. Up to 30%, 50%, and 80% of the men affected are over
the ages of 30, 50, and 80 respectively. Androgens play an impor -tant role that appears to be independent from genetic predisposi -tion, which is considered the main etiologic factor in AGA (2, 3). Testosterone is converted into its more potent form dihydrotestos -terone (DHT) by the enzyme 5α-reductase (5α-R). The AGA-prone scalp has high levels of DHT and augmented androgen receptor (AR) expression (4). Inflammatory processes are also increasingly being cited as an integral part in the pathogenesis of AGA (4–8). In AGA, scalp biopsies from both men and women revealed follic -ular microinflammation and lymphocytic folliculitis, targeting an immunologically driven trigger (7, 8). One of the factors leading to permanent hair loss in AGA may be this continuous inflammation and remodeling of the connective tissue of follicles (4).Telogen effluvium (TE) is another frequent cause of diffuse hair loss, but the true incidence is not well known because of insuf -
ficient data, especially due to subclinical cases (9). Although TE may be one manifestation of various chronic systemic illnesses, an association between stress and hair loss is well accepted among clinicians (10, 11). The sensitivity of human hair follicles to key skin-stress mediators has been demonstrated: organ-cultured hair follicles responded to substance P with premature catagen development and degranulation of mast cells in the connective tissue sheath of hair follicles, indicating a neurogenic inflamma -tion (12). Acute TE due to oxidative stress induced by ultraviolet radiation has also been identified. Photoactivation of porphyrin compounds produced by bacteria in the pilosebaceous duct led to oxidative tissue injury and follicular microinflammation (13).Currently, although topical minoxidil and oral finasteride are the only medications approved for AGA, cause-oriented treatment is performed for TE. Considering the androgenetic and inflamma -
tory factors in the pathogenesis explained above, we formulated a herbal shampoo and solution containing a mixture of six different herbal extracts (HE) with antiandrogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative features. Our hypothesis was that, if there is a high enough concentration of relevant flavonoids, vitamins, and trace elements at the site of action (i.e., hair follicles), then inflamma -tory and aging processes can be slowed down and reversed to a certain extent. This study was performed to assess the efficacy, safety, and synergy of the new cosmetic herbal shampoo and so -lution for treatment of AGA or TE.MethodsProducts testedHerbal shampoo:  aqua, sodium laureth sulfate, cocamidopropyl betaine, sodium chloride, mixture of herbal extracts ( Urtica urens  leaf extract, Urtica dioica  root extract, Matricaria chamomilla flow -er extract, Achillea millefolium  aerial part extract, Ceratonia sili -

However, certain plants and their standardized extracts may provide some clinical benefits against hair loss. We formulated a herbal shampoo and a solution to evaluate their efficacy, safety, and synergy in hair loss.Methods:  We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, clinical and instrumental study for 6 months on 120 sub -jects with androgenetic alopecia and telogen effluvium, confirmed by pull test and phototricogram. Each subject was examined monthly. At the end of the study, a self-assessment test was carried out.
Results: Herbal formulations were found to be more effective in preventing and reducing hair loss than placebo at every assess -ment point. Anagen/telogen ratios improved significantly in the study group. In addition, concomitant use of the shampoo and solution were found to be more effective than single product use.Conclusion:  We interpret this eutrophic effect for scalp hair as the final outcome of the entire content of our herbal formula, which has antiandrogenic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, angiogenic, and hair-stimulating features. In combination, these features help prevent hair from falling out and reducing hair loss.Keywords:  herbal extract, hair loss, clinical studyActa Dermatovenerologica Alpina, Pannonica et AdriaticaActa Dermatovenerol APAReceived:  11 December 2017 | Returned for modification:  25 January 2018 |  Accepted:  26 February 2018

OES) at Saniter Lab, Istanbul, Turkey.Clinical panel and ethical requirementsThe sample consisted of otherwise healthy Caucasian subjects (60 males and 60 females) 20 to 55 years old, suffering from AGA grades II and III in accordance with the Hamilton–Norwood scale or TE, enrolled in the trial (54 AGA subjects, 66 TE subjects) with written informed consent. The subjects were chosen under the control of a dermatologist on the basis of the inclusion/exclusion criteria: the subjects were not using any topical or systemic medi -cations, they had no scalp or hair disease except the trial indica -tions, they had no hypersensitivity history, and none of them were pregnant or lactating. All of the trial procedures were performed in line with the ethical principles laid down for medical research (Helsinki Declaration of World Medical Association, 1964, and amendments). In the event of any unexpected or adverse reaction, a medical investigator was on standby for intervention.
Group formationThe products’ allocations were randomized in accordance with a randomization list. The randomization list was created using Wei’s urn algorithm, which is designed to generate balanced ran -dom samples throughout the course of an experiment. The follow -ing groups were formed: Group A: 30 subjects that used herbal (active) shampoo, Group B: 30 subjects that used herbal (active) solution, Group C: 30 subjects that used herbal (active) shampoo and herbal (active) solution, and Group D: 30 subjects that used placebo shampoo and placebo solution. In addition to the mean/median ages of the subjects, the gender and clinical distribution in each group are presented in Table 1. There were no differences in the demographic features among the groups.Product useShampoo:  Every other day, three times a week, apply 5 ml on wet hair, wait for 3 to 4 minutes after foaming, and then rinse well.Solution:  Every day in the morning and in the evening, apply
3 ml on dry hair and massage all over the scalp. Let it stand for at least 4 to 6 hours.Study design
Solution:  Every day in the morning and in the evening, apply 3 ml on dry hair and massage all over the scalp. Let it stand for at least 4 to 6 hours.Study designAfter the enrollment and the evaluation of the physiological scalp and hair conditions by the dermatologist (T 0), the subjects were informed about the principles of the study. At the end of each month, the subjects were evaluated based on the criteria present -ed in Table 2.Pull testThe pull test was used to assess diffuse hair loss. Mild traction was performed on a bunch of hair (approximately 60 fibers) and the number of hairs extracted was counted. Operatively, the derma -tologist took a few strands between his thumb and forefinger and pulled them gently. Anagen (growing) hair should remain rooted in place, and telogen (non-growing) hair should come out easily. If the number of lost hairs was greater than six, the pull test was considered positive. Subjects were requested not to wash their
hair in the 24 hours before the pull test.PhototricogramA targeted area of 1.8 cm² was chosen for clipping. This was a zone of transition between normal hair and the balding area in male subjects with AGA, and the middle part of the vertex in TE and fe -male AGA subjects. The shaved hair zone was dyed gray, and pho -tos were taken with a digital close-up camera immediately and 2 days later. By comparing these two consecutive photographs with a software system identifying individual hair fibers, growing (ana -gen phase) or non-growing (telogen phase) fibers were determined.Table 1  | Sex and clinical distributions, means ± standard deviations (SD), and medians of the ages for each group and all subjects.Group Male Female AGA TE Age (mean ± SD) Age (median)A 15 15 14 16 36.6 ± 10.6 37.0B 15 15 13 17 37.3 ± 9.7 37.0C 15 15 13 17 36.6 ± 9.7 34.5D 15 15 14 16 37.0 ± 9.6 36.0Total 60 60 54 66 36.9 ± 9.8 36.5AGA = androgenetic alopecia, TE = telogen effluvium.

The questionnaire is presented in Table 3.Statistical analysesIn intragroup evaluation (time course), the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for non-parametric pull test data and repeated measured analysis of variance followed by Student’s t-test for parametric phototricogram data were used. In intergroup evaluation (ac -tive vs. active vs. placebo), the Wilcoxon Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks for non-parametric pull test and self-assessment data, and multivariate analysis of variance followed
by Student’s t-test for parametric phototricogram data were used.ResultsPhytochemical analyses of HEThe vitamins, flavonoids, and trace elements found in phyto -chemical analyses of HE are presented in Table 4. The quantities of all of them are expressed as mg/100 g dry extract.Pull testThe comparison between Group A / shampoo (active) vs. Group B / solution (active) vs. Group C / shampoo (active) + solution (ac -tive) vs. Group D / shampoo (placebo) + solution (placebo) are presented in Fig. 1, and the graph reports the mean (%) decrease obtained for each product tested. The data are reported as mean (%) variation of hair loss during the pull test for each month (T1–T6) compared to the beginning of the trial (T 0). Although the in -tragroup statistical analyses revealed significant improvement in all groups for all months compared to T 0, the intergroup analyses showed that Group C (active shampoo + solution) had the best
clinical outcomes and Group D (placebo shampoo + solution) had the worst. The p values of the intergroup analyses are presented in Table 5. Fig. 1 also shows that longer usage of products corre -sponds to better clinical outcomes.PhototrichogramWhereas there was no increase in group D (placebo shampoo + solution) during the study, the number of total hairs in groups A (active shampoo), B (active solution), and C (active shampoo + solution) increased significantly in month 4 (T4) and month 6 (T6) compared to the beginning of the trial (T 0, Fig. 2).

The herbal/active shampoo and solution helped ameliorate the baseline conditions of subjects suffering from AGA or TE. In this 6-month study, the regular use of the herbal
shampoo and/or solution decreased hair loss and increased the number of anagen hairs. These effects, clinically or instrumen -tally confirmed, were also perceived by the subjects participating in the study and significantly delineated in the statistical analy -ses of self-assessment results.

55Acta Dermatovenerol APA | 2018;27:51-57 A herbal extract against hair lossnificantly better than those obtained in the groups that used only one active product (shampoo or solution). The concomitant use of herbal shampoo and herbal solution had a synergistic effect in improving the parameters measured.DiscussionThe causes for the clear significant positive results of the products tested should be sought in the interaction between the properties of the plants in our HE and etiopathogenetic factors in the hair loss types included in this study.Among the plants used in the formulation, Urtica dioica  (Ud) is the most widely studied. The use of Ud root extract in sympto -matic benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and lower urinary tract symptoms has been investigated in numerous clinical trials and found effective (14–17). This indication is mainly due to its 5α-R inhibition activity (18, 19). Inhibition of 5α-R hampers the forma -
tion of DHT from testosterone. An excess amount of DHT is related to BPH (17). The same pathogenesis is also true for AGA (4, 5), and this mechanism of action may be the main cause of the success of our formulation in patients with AGA. Although Ud leaves have traditionally been used for hair loss, confirmatory clinical trials are still lacking (17). In a study performed with a combination of herbal extracts including Ud, it was shown that the combination enhanced human dermal papilla cell proliferation at concentra -tions between 1.5% and 4.5% (20).As stated in the introduction to this report, apart from the pathogenesis of AGA related to androgen metabolism, inflamma -tory and oxidative processes are the basic common pathways in the etiopathogenesis of both AGA and TE (4–13). Polysaccharides and caffeic malic acid (CMA) both exist to some extent in every part of Ud. Urtica  polysaccharides and CMA present anti-inflam -
matory activity by inhibiting cyclooxigenase and lipoxygenase (21, 22). β sitosterol, also a component of Ud, stimulates angio -genesis by increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) synthesis and supports new hair growth (23). This molecule also suppresses testosterone synthesis and contributes to decreased DHT levels (24).The proximate analysis results showed that leaf extract of Urtica urens  (Uu) contains a high amount of total phenolics, fla -vonoids, tannins, ortho-diphenols, and flavonols (25, 26). It has been shown to decrease paw edema after carrageenin administra -tion in rats and to improve the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and malondialdehyde, exhib -iting powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity (26).In a study performed with Equisetum arvense  (Ea) alone and with a combination of some other plants, Ea suppressed super -oxide anion levels in the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system and
eliminated the hydroxyl radical. Ea also reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neutrophils that were stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate. In the same study, although carrageenin-in -duced paw swelling in rats was significantly inhibited by the plant mixture, this inhibition could not be achieved by the components on an individual basis (27). This phenomenon could explain why our plant mixture also had a synergistic effect in obtaining the good outcomes in the study. In addition to various studies depict -ing its antioxidative features (28–30), Ea exhibited significant diabetic wound healing by showing higher epidermal and dermal regeneration, angiogenesis, and granulation tissue thickness in diabetic rats (31). Ea is one of the highest silicon accumulators among plant species. Silicon penetrates the hair follicles, enters in the hair matrix, and makes the hair fibers thicker. Therefore, the higher the silicon quantity in the hair, the lower the extent of
hair loss (32, 33).Leaves and flowers of Achillea millefolium  (Am) have been used
the higher the silicon quantity in the hair, the lower the extent of hair loss (32, 33).Leaves and flowers of Achillea millefolium  (Am) have been used for centuries for their anti-inflammatory effect in conditions such as rheumatism, wound healing, and skin inflammation (34). In an in vivo study performed with Am oil extract on artificially irritated skin, the parameters tested (i.e., pH, capacitance, and erythema index) were restored to basal values after 3 to 7 days of treatment (35). Am extract showed an augmentation in cytokeratin-10, transglutaminase-1, and filaggrin expressions, together with an increase in the thickness of epidermis in cultured skin biopsies. In addition, a 2-month topical application of 2% Am extract signif -icantly improved the outlook of wrinkles and pores in vivo  when compared with placebo (36).Historically, oil of Matricaria chamomilla  (Mc, German chamo -mile) has been used in the treatment of some inflammatory der -
matoses. It contains three major sesquiterpene compounds (i.e., azulene, bisabolol, and farnesene) with anti-inflammatory or antihistamine effects. Among them, α-bisabolol has the strongest anti-inflammatory effect (37, 38). In a study performed with 3% Mc oil topically on the skin of mice showing its immunoregula -tory potential, it alleviated atopic dermatitis through influencing helper T cell 2 (Th2) activation (39). Mc extract applied topically also showed wound healing potential in a linear incisional model in rats (40). A pharmacologically active flavonoid apigenin that is contained by both Mc and Am supports hair growth by suppress -ing transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), which stimulates the catagen phase in the hair growth cycle (41, 42).Ceratonia siliqua  (Cs) pod extract presents antioxidant features due to its catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epigallocate -chin gallate, and epicatechin gallate contents, along with simpler
phenolics, such as phloroglucinol, pyrogallol, catechol, and gal -lic acid (43–45). In addition, Cs fibers exhibit higher antioxidant capacity than many edible products rich in polyphenols, such as blueberries, grapes, or red wine (46, 47).On the other hand, the flavonoids, vitamins, and trace ele -ments we found in the phytochemical analyses of our formulation may offer more specific support for the wellbeing of hair physi -ology. Myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and copper keep the hair follicle in the anagen phase longer by inhibiting 5α-R type 2 and preventing DHT formation (48, 49). Vitamin B complex and vitamin C (ascorbic acid) enhance blood vessel formation and increase blood flow in the scalp by stimulating the synthesis of VEGF (50). It was reported that mice that were exposed to high amounts of environmental cigarette smoke developed alopecia, and this was precluded by administration of l-cystine and vitamin
B6 (pyridoxine) combination (51). B-group vitamins and l-cystine mixtures are also customarily used in OTC products for hair loss (52). Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is known to enhance the metabolism of vitamin B6 (53, 54). Vitamin C might improve the efficacy of therapeutic angiogenesis by cell transplantation (55). Some deriv -atives of vitamin C were also found to be promising in treating and preventing DHT-induced balding (56). Iron is a crucial cofactor for the enzymes implicated in energy metabolism and DNA synthesis. It is a fundamental element for healthy skin, mucous membranes, hair, and nails. In the case of scalp hair, iron deficiency leads to dryness and fragility (57). Zinc is found in the enzyme systems af -fecting hair formation, and local zinc ions stimulate scalp cellular formation (50). Zinc metabolism disturbances play a key role in hair loss, especially in AGA and TE (58).
