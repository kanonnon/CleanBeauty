Introduction to skin agingDesmond J. Tobin *Centre for Skin Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Bradford, Bradford,West Yorkshire BD7 1DP, UKKEYWORDSSkin;Aging;Epidermis;Dermis;PhotoagingAbstract Cutaneous science has seen considerable development in the last 25years, in part due to the Omics revolution, and the appreciation that this organis hardwired into the body’s key neuro-immuno-endocrine axes. Moreover, thereis greater appreciation of how stratiﬁcation of skin disorders will permit more tar-geted and more effective treatments. Against this has been how the remarkableextension in the average human life-span, though in the West at least, this parallelsworrying increases in lifestyle-associated conditions like diabetes, skin cancer etc.These demographic trends bring greater ur gency to ﬁnding clinical solutions fornumerous age-related deﬁcits in skin function caused by extrinsic and intrinsic fac-
tors. Mechanisms for aging skin include the actions of reactive oxygen species(ROS), mtDNA mutations, and telomere shortening, as well as hormonal changes.We have also signiﬁcantly improved our understanding of how to harness theskin’s considerable regenerative capaci ty e.g., via its remarkable investment ofstem cell subpopulations. In this way we hope to develop new strategies to selec-tively target the skin’s capacity to undergo optimal wound repair and regeneration.Here, the unsung hero of the skin regenerative power may be the humble hair fol-licle, replete with its compliment of epithelial, mesenchymal, neural and otherstem cells. This review introduces the topic of human skin aging, with a focus onhow maintenance of function in this complex multi-cell type organ is key for retain-ing quality of life into old age.ª2016 Tissue Viability Society.

Skin, our largest organ by weight and extent, canbe viewed as a sensor of the body’s periphery, averitable ‘brain on the outside’ [1]. While thequestion of ‘what is the function of skin’ is adaunting one, the best single discussion on thefunction of skin can, in my view, be found in themulti-author discussion review ‘What is the ‘true’function of skin?’ [2]. The skin organ is truly abiologic universe, as it incorporates all the body’smajor support systems; of blood, innervation,muscle, as well as its immuno-competence,* Tel.: þ44 1274 233585.E-mail address: d.tobin@bradford.ac.uk .http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtv.2016.03.0020965-206X/ ª2016 Tissue Viability Society.

psycho-emotion reactivity, ultraviolet radiationsensing, endocrine functions etc. Together, theseparticipate in the homeostasis of skin and its ap-pendages, and in this way are important for thehomeostasis of the entire mammalian body. Whilenot always the case, this view now appears self-evident, given that the skin occupies such a stra-tegic location between the noxious external andbiochemically-active internal environments. Forall its perfection, in terms of evolutionary adap-tation to life on an ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-drenched terrestrial planet, skin conditions stillrank 4th in the leading causes of nonfatal diseaseburden [3]. This burden is likely to rise further aswe age [4]given our lifestyle choices of inactivity,sugar, tobacco, alcohol etc.Recent insights into the skin’s remarkable
Recent insights into the skin’s remarkablestress-sensing capacity, much of which is commu-nicated via the skin’s equivalent of thehypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (and thyroid) axis,allow us to assess how age may affect these keyaxes. Perhaps counterintuitive, it is important tonote upfront that well-nourished and UVR-protected skin exhibits truly remarkable resil-ience to chronological (or intrinsic) aging, andmuch if not most of what we refer to skin aging isdue to the structural changes to the skin that are aconsequence of so-called extrinsic aging (e.g.,UVR, trauma, chemicals etc.).The harbingers of our lost youth can be mostreadily seen in our skin as we age; including skin
wrinkling (rides), hair graying (canities) and formost men and some women the tendency for scalphair thinning/baldness. These changes may conferonly small losses in function, but as our expecta-tions for the extension of optimal functioningcontinue to grow well into our 70s, 80s andbeyond, these changes are unwelcome. This isperhaps reasonable, as life expectancy in westerncountries is expected to be 100 years in the nextdecade [5]. The implications of this unprece-dented change for human history will be greatestfor women, as they will soon spend as much as 50%of their lives post-menopause, where low estrogenlevels will adversely affect skin function. Themarket is responding by developing sophisticatedcosmetic/cosmeceuticals, pharmaceuticals andsurgeries to provide options to assuage not only ourvanity but also to aid our increasingly dry/itchy[6], infection-prone [7], vascular, immune-unsta-ble[8]skin.Given its strategic location at the body’s
Given its strategic location at the body’sinterface, the skin is subjected to intrinsic(chronologic) aging that are generally under ge-netic and hormonal inﬂuence and extrinsic agingcaused by environmental factors, principally UVradiation (UVR), smoking, diet, chemicals, traumaetc. UVR effects on skin are so powerful thatthese are designated separately as photo-aging .Both types of aging have their distinct and over-lapping features [9]. Importantly, skin aging traits(e.g., perceived age, pigmented age spots, skinwrinkles and sun-damage) appear to be equallyinﬂuenced by genetic and environmental factors[10,11] .2. Intrinsic agingIntrinsic aging of skin is imperceptibly slow mov-ing, and shows signiﬁcant variation between pop-ulations, individuals of the same ethnicity, anddifferent sites on the same person. Essentially
different sites on the same person. Essentiallyintrinsic skin aging can only be seen in quite oldage and is characterized by unblemished, smooth,pale(r), drier, less elastic skin with ﬁne wrinkles[12,13] . Additional subcutaneous changes in theface also lead to somewhat exaggerated expres-sion lines. Intrinsic aging occurs within the tissueitself, via reductions in dermal mast cells, ﬁbro-blasts, collagen production, ﬂattening of dermal-epidermal junction/loss of rete ridges, as well asbeing caused by how aging in other organs affectthe skin. From a form-function perspective, theﬂattening of the previously undulating epidermis isa most striking change caused by a loss of the reteridges and their reciprocal inter-digitation withcapillary-rich dermal papillae. A likely conse-
quence of this is reduced nutrient support to theavascular epidermis by the vascularized dermis.From a mechanistic point of view, intrinsically-aged epidermis is also controlled by progressivetelomere shortening, exacerbated by low-gradeoxidative damage to telomeres and other cellularconstituents [14,15] .3. Extrinsic agingWhile interventions for intrinsic aging are difﬁcult,except perhaps via hormone supplementationetc., the prevention and treatment of extrinsicaging-associated changes to skin structure andappearance is the subject of much attention.However, the impact of extrinsic-aging driverscannot be completely separated from how skinresponds to chronologic aging. Exogenous factorswill impact skin physiology permanently (e.g., pro-oxidant and antioxidant inﬂuences on cell turnovervia neuro-endocrine-immune biological responsemodiﬁers). By far the greatest source of extrinsic38 D.J. Tobin
aging is accumulated and unprotected sun expo-sure (i.e., photo-aging). This is largely conﬁned tothe face, neck, hands, and less so lower arms andlegs. Over 80% of facial skin aging is due to low-grade chronic UVR exposure, although exposurecan also cause sunburn, tanning, inﬂammation,immunosuppression, and damage to dermal con-nective tissue [16,17] . The characteristics ofextrinsically-aged skin (mostly UVR-induced)include coarse wrinkling, rough texture, sallowcomplexion with mottled pigmentation, and loss ofskin elasticity.Photo-aging is caused by sunlight, which at theearth’s surface consists mostly of infrared(52e55%), visible (44%) and 3% UV light. The vastmajority of the sun’s UVR (400 e10 nm) is blockedby the earth’s atmosphere such that UVR reachingour planet’s surface consists of >95% UVA(400e315 nm) and w5% UVB (315 e280 nm). UVC(280e100 nm), which is extremely hazardous to
(280e100 nm), which is extremely hazardous toskin, is completely absorbed by the ozone layerand atmosphere. The ratio of UVA to UVB reachingour skin depends on latitude, season and time andin the real-world is 25. Alas, most studies haveused solar-simulated radiation with a UVA:UVBratio of <18 as a proxy for noon summer sun on aclear day [18].Deeply-penetrating UVA damages connectivetissue in the dermis and also increases risk for skincancer, while UVB penetrates only as far as theepidermis where it can cause sunburn, tanning,and photocarcinogenesis [19]. UVB is the majorcause for direct DNA damage and induces inﬂam-mation and immunosuppression [20], while UVAmay have a greater role in skin photo-aging, givenits greater amount in sunlight and the fact thatboth dermis and epidermis are irradiated [20].First signs of extrinsic aging (on exposed sites) canbe seen as early as 15 years of age in pale-skinnedCaucasians [21], whereas changes to non-exposed
Caucasians [21], whereas changes to non-exposedsites are not apparent until age 30 years [22].The high priority in Western culture of a golden tan[23] is associated alas, with ever-rising rates ofskin cancer and prematurely-aged skin. Photo-aged skin is characterized by deep wrinkles,laxity, roughness, a sallow or yellow color,increased fragility, purpura formation, mottledpigmentary changes, telangiectasia, impairedwound healing, and benign and malignant growths.The degree of accumulated sun exposure de-termines the magnitude of these changes. Mech-anisms of UVR-induced and accelerated aging arediscussed later in this review. The second mostimportant driver of extrinsic aging is cigarettesmoking [24e28].3.1. Skin typeThe level of eumelanin in skin helps protect
The level of eumelanin in skin helps protectagainst the cumulative effects of photo-aging.Typically, skin phototype is described using theFitzpatrick classiﬁcation I-VI (ranging from ‘alwaysburn never tan’ to ‘always tan and never burns’).When phototypes were compared it was found thatskin of type VI individuals (i.e., black) shows littledifference between exposed and unexposed sites[29]. Moreover, the much higher rates of skincancer among Caucasians compared with blackAfrican eAmericans reﬂects the signiﬁcant protec-tion from UVR damage that eumelanin provides (upto 500-fold level) [30]. Furthermore, the appear-ance of photo-damaged skin differs for those withskin types I and II (red hair/freckles/burns easily)
and those with skin types III and IV (darker skin,tans easily), whereby the former tend to showatrophic skin changes, but with fewer wrinkles,and focal depigmentation (guttate hypomelanosis)and dysplastic changes, such as actinic keratosesand epidermal malignancies. In contrast, thosewith III/IV skin develop hypertrophic responses,such as deep wrinkling, coarseness, a leather-likeappearance, and lentigines [20]. Basal cell andsquamous cell carcinomas occur almost exclusivelyon sun-exposed skin of light-skinned people.Skin has been report to increase in thickness inchronologic and photo-aging. However, while bothincreases and decreases in skin thickness can beseen in different body sites, there was no general
Skin has been report to increase in thickness inchronologic and photo-aging. However, while bothincreases and decreases in skin thickness can beseen in different body sites, there was no generalrelationship between skin thickness and with age[30,31] . Thus, it appears that the epidermis thinswith age at some body sites, such as the upperinner arm [32,33] and back of the upper arm [34],but remains constant at others, such as thebuttock, dorsal forearm, and shoulder [35]eavariation not explained by sun or environmentalexposure alone [30]. Although epidermal thicknessappears to remain largely constant with advancingage, there is some variability in keratinocyte shapeand size with age, speciﬁcally that these cellsbecome shorter and ﬂatter in contrasts to an in-crease in corneocyte size potentially as a resultdecreased epidermal cell turnover with age [13].Wrinkling in Asian skin has been documented tooccur later and with less severity than in whiteCaucasians [22].4. Epidermis
Caucasians [22].4. EpidermisThe epidermis is composed of an outer nonviablelayer called the stratum corneum, with moreSkin aging 39
proximal layers making up the viable epidermisconsists primarily of keratinocytes (90 e95% ofcells). Smaller populations of Langerhans cells(2%), melanocytes (3%) and Merkel cells (0.5%) canalso be found in the epidermis [1].The stratum corneum provides the body’s mainbarrier to the environment, and is key to main-taining optimal cutaneous hydration [36]. Simplis-tically, its structure has been described by a“bricks and mortar” model with protein-rich cor-neocytes (bricks) embedded in a matrix (mortar) ofceramides, cholesterol, and fatty acids [30].I ti sgenerally agreed that the thickness of the stratumcorneum does not change signiﬁcantly with age[37]. However, certain features of aging skin doindicate an abnormal skin barrier, namely theextreme skin dryness (xerosis) and increased sus-ceptibility to irritant dermatitis. There is also ev-idence of altered permeability to chemicalsubstances [38] and reduced trans-epidermalwater ﬂux in aged skin [30]. Despite these, the
water ﬂux in aged skin [30]. Despite these, thebaseline skin barrier function is relatively unaf-fected by age [37], and substances recoverablefrom the skin surface (sebum, sweat, componentsof natural moisturizing factor, and corneocytedebris) were neither affected by age nor byethnicity and gender [39].The barrier function in aged skin ( >80 years) ismore readily disrupted by sequential tape strip-ping than is young skin (20 e30 years), as wasbarrier recovery [37]. It appears that there is aglobal reduction in stratum corneum lipids, whichmay affect the “mortar” that binds the corneo-cytes together. In moderately aged (50 e80 years)individuals, abnormal stratum corneum acidiﬁca-tion results in delayed lipid processing, delayedpermeability barrier recovery, and abnormal stra-tum corneum integrity, ion transport and turnover[40e43].Flattening of the dermo-epidermal junction atsites that were highly corrugated in youth is themost consistent change found in aged skin [44] and
is due primarily to a retraction of the rete ridges[30]. This reduced interdigitation betweenepidermis and dermis results is less resistance toshearing forces [13,22] as well as a reduced supplyof nutrients and oxygen [8]. This effect is likely tobe inﬂuenced by solar elastosis changes in thepapillary dermis (see below) [45]. Even with min-imal photo-aging one can appreciate loss ofﬁbrillin-rich microﬁbrils in the dermal-epidermaljunction ean early marker of photoaging[46e48]. There is general agreement thatepidermal cell turnover halves between the thirdand seventh decades of life [49,50] , and thisconcurs with the observed deterioration in woundhealing capacity in old age [51].4.1. KeratinocytesKeratinocytes in the basal layer of the epidermisexhibit increasing atypia with age [33]. In addition,basal keratinocytes downregulate expression ofsome b1-integrins [52], suggesting that prolifera-tion and adhesion of keratinocytes in photo-damaged aged skin are abnormal.
4.2. MelanocytesThe number of functional (i.e. tyrosinase-positive/active) melanocytes decline by up to 20% perdecade in the basal layer of the human epidermis[53], although paradoxically there is often an in-crease in melanocyte number in photo-damagedskin [54]. This is further reﬂected by a reductionin melanocytic nevi in old age [55]. Less melano-cytes is associated with melanin production, whichmeans less protection against the harmful effectsof UVR [56].There are also changes to melanocyte functionin the aging/graying hair follicle (see below) [57].Aged skin of most ethnicities show an increase insolar lentigo lesions (age spots), and thesecontribute more to perceived age than wrinkling
contribute more to perceived age than wrinklingfor those of mongoloid Asian ethnicity. Age spotsexhibit major histological changes to the basallayer of the epidermis, especially the elongation ofepidermal rete ridges (note epidermal ﬂatteningseen in general skin aging). The number oftyrosinase-positive melanocytes per length ofdermal/epidermal interface may increase in the
spot versus the unaffected skin [58]. Though otherstudies only report increased melanocyte size,dendrite elongation and alterations in melano-somes and their organization. Endothelin-1 andstem cell factor may be key regulators of hyper-pigmentation in solar lentigo [59].5. DermisThe dermis consists predominantly of connectivetissue (e.g., collagen and elastin), but also con-tains appendages including sweat glands and pilo-sebaceous units as well as blood vessels, andnerves. Its main role is to provide a tough andﬂexible layer that supports the epidermis andbinds to the subcutis, the fatty layer deep to thedermis. Collagen ﬁbers give the skin its tensilestrength, whereas elastin ﬁbers contribute to40 D.J. Tobin
elasticity and resilience [60]. Although agingchanges in elderly dermis with severe damage mayexhibit thinning [61], it remains difﬁcult to deﬁnethe effects of aging on skin thickness due toconsiderable inter-individual and inter-body sitevariations and because of differences in method-ology between different studies [30]. While themechanism of wrinkle formation is not entirelyunderstood [44], there is general atrophy of theextracellular matrix, accompanied by fewer ﬁ-broblasts, and with reduced synthetic ability[62,63] . Photo-aged skin exhibit histological fea-tures of chronic inﬂammation without signiﬁcantevidence of clinical or molecular abnormalities[64e66].Collagen is the body’s most abundant protein.As the principle structural component of thedermis it confers strength and support to humanskin. Alterations in collagen play an integral role inthe skin aging process [56]. Dermal collagen bun-
dles are well-organized in young adults, wherethey are arranged to facilitate an extension thatreturns to resting state via interwoven elastic ﬁ-bers [44]. In aging skin however, there is an in-crease in density of collagen bundles [67] but theylose their extensible conﬁguration, insteadbecoming fragmented, disorganized, and less sol-uble [65,68] . Collagen-degrading enzymes (e.g.,matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)) are upregu-lated during both photoaging and intrinsic aging,mainly via the production of reactive oxygen spe-cies (ROS) [69]. Collagen synthesis decreases [70]resulting in a shift in the balance between syn-thesis and degradation [8,13] . Speciﬁcally, inyoung skin collagen I comprises 80% of dermalcollagen and type III makes up 15%.However, withage there is a decrease in collagen I with a resul-tant increase in the ratio of type III to type Icollagen [68,71] . There are also changes to levels
of collagen IV and VII. Importantly, collagen IV,which is an integral part of the dermo-epidermaljunction, provides a structural framework forother molecules and plays a key role in maintainingmechanical stability [59]. Lower levels of collagenIV and collagen VII exist at the base of wrinkles,suggesting these collagens contribute to wrinkleformation [72].Human skin is uniquely rich in elastic ﬁbers withregional variation in their density. Elastin exhibitsnumerous age-related changes, and UVR triggersremodeling/degradation of elastic ﬁbers mostlyregulated by MMPs [45,73,74] and abnormal local-ization of elastin in the upper dermis of photo-damaged skin [30]. Solar elastosis is, histological-ly, a most striking features of photo-damaged skinand represents a tangled mass of degraded elasticﬁbers, disorganized tropoelastin and ﬁbrillinlocated in the upper dermis including adjacent tothe dermis-epidermis junction [20]. Most elastin
ﬁbers appear abnormal over 70 years of age,including in sun-protected sites [66,75] . Thisabnormal elastotic material confers no elasticitynor resilience to skin. While recovery from me-chanical depression takes only minutes in youngskin, this can extend to >24 h in the elderly.Counterintuitively, the level of glycosaminogly-cans (GAGs) increases in photo-aged skin [76,77]but while young skin is well-hydrated (as most ofthe water is bound to proteins [78,79] there is ashift toward ‘tetrahedron water’ in aged skin. Thishas poor hydration and turgor capacity and con-tributes to the dry (xerotic) appearance of photo-aged skin [30]. There is an overall reduction insubcutaneous fat volume in aged skin, despite thefact that total body fat (e.g., thighs, waist,abdomen) can continue to increase until around 70years of age. Greatest fat loss is seen in the face,feet and hands [55,79] .5.1. Nerves and sensationSkin enervation is little affected by aging, though
some studies report a decrease in sensoryperception and an increase in pain threshold withage[80,81] . There is some loss of nerve support inbald scalp, but this is likely driven by hair follicle
some studies report a decrease in sensoryperception and an increase in pain threshold withage[80,81] . There is some loss of nerve support inbald scalp, but this is likely driven by hair follicleminiaturization than by skin aging per se [81].5.2. Dermal vasculatureSkin aging may be associated with decreasedcutaneous perfusion, especially in photo-exposedareas [30,82] . This reduction in vascularity isespecially detectable in superﬁcial papillarydermis, where there is loss of the vertical capillaryloops previously associated with the now absentrete ridges. Reduced vascularity results in skinpallor, depleted nutrient exchange, and disturbedthermoregulation [30,56] . Dermal vessels inseverely photo-damaged skin show thin anddilated walls, presenting as telangiectasia [20].6. Skin appendages6.1. Eccrine and apocrine sweat glandsThe reduction in eccrine sweat glands [83] andtheir output [84] in skin with increasing age im-
their output [84] in skin with increasing age im-pacts whole body thermoregulation. While theresponse to epinephrine is reduced in men andSkin aging 41
women in old age, there is a greater decrease inresponse to acetylcholine in men than in women[84,85] . Apocrine gland activity is also diminishedwith age, probably as a consequence of decliningtestosterone levels with consequent reduction inbody odor [86].6.2. NailsNail growth increases until about the age of 25years, thereafter it starts to decrease [44]. Untilthe age of 70, nail growth is greater in men thanwomen, after which the situation appears to bereversed [87]. Nails become more brittle in theelderly and develop beaded ridging due to areduction in lipophilic sterols and free fatty acids[88].6.3. Pilo-sebaceous unitThe pilo-sebaceous unit, including both the hairfollicle as its associated sebaceous glands, exhibitsperhaps the most profound age-associatedchanges. During puberty there is a striking trans-formation of low sebum-secreting, ﬁne and near-invisible vellus ﬁbers to high sebum-secreting pig-
mented, coarse terminal hairs. Paradoxically,there may be a miniaturization of hair folliclesduring age-related male pattern alopecia. Theseanatomic changes in the hair follicle (enlargementand miniaturization) results in a signiﬁcantremodeling of the dermis in the adjacent inter-follicular skin, as highlighted by the signiﬁcantreduction in subcutaneous fat layer of bald scalpincreased the likelihood of cuts and bruising in thisarea [89]. While age does not signiﬁcantly alter theabsolute number of pilo-sebaceous units per unitarea on the scalp, their sebaceous glands maybecome hyperplastic and larger [90]. Despite thisincrease in size, there is a 50% reduction in sebumproduction [91], suggesting reduction in holocrinesebocyte turnover, which contributes to xerosis ofaged skin. This may be due to decreased levels oftestosterone [92]. Sebum secretion and type is alsosigniﬁcantly reduced in post-menopausal women,suggesting these glands are also estrogen sensitive[93].6.4. Hair
6.4. HairPowerful evolutionary selection ensures that thehair follicle is, in the main, hardwired againstsigniﬁcant aging-related loss of function, evenafter 12 or more decades of life [89]. Processesunderlying aging in general, e.g., oxidativedamage, telomere shortening, age-relating de-ﬁciencies related to nuclear/mitochondrial DNAdamage and repair as well as age-related re-ductions in the cells’ energy supply, will all impacton whether some follicular cell subpopulations willenter cellular senescence. Chest, axillary, andpubic hair all decrease in density with age; how-ever, in men there is often increased hair growthvigor in other body site like the eyebrows, aroundthe external auditory meati, and in nostrils, andthis may reﬂect the maintenance of high testos-terone levels in males into the 70s [44]. In elderlywomen there is a similar conversion of vellus tocoarse terminal hairs on the chin and moustache,which is thought to reﬂect an unmasking of tes-
which is thought to reﬂect an unmasking of tes-tosterone’s inﬂuence in the context of nowdiminished estrogen balance.Aside from intrinsic aging, a principal inﬂuenceon hair with age is androgenetic alopecia. This is adistinct entity from the more aging-related hairthinning recently described as ‘senescent’ alope-cia[94] as androgenetic alopecia (or common malepattern baldness) can manifest very early on, evenin the late teenage years. Microarray analysis hasnow shown that androgenetic and senescent alo-pecia differ signiﬁcantly in gene expression, suchthat these two types of age-related alopecia showtwo distinct proﬁles. While the former is the resultof dihydro-testosterone action on so-calledandrogen-sensitive hair follicles [95], senescentalopecia may not accurately represent true aging
alopecia may not accurately represent true agingeffects on the hair follicle. By contrast, so-calledfemale patterned alopecia may be truly ‘andro-genetic’ for only a small number of women withthinning hair, and so other age-associated alope-cias in women are likely to have other causes [96].
Regardless of cause, age-related alopecia affectsat least 50% of men by the age of 50 years and 50%of women by the age of 60 years [97].White hair was thicker on average, showed moremedulla [98,99] and grew faster than pigmentedhair. Interestingly, these researchers have alsodescribed an age-related reduction in hair growthrate, but that this was broadly limited to pig-mented hairs. Thus, the implication is that,counter-intuitively, the apparently more ‘aged’white hairs may be partially spared these agingchanges. The tensile strength of hair also de-creases with age, having increased from birth tothe second decade. Changes in hair color anddensity are very visible indicators of age and arethe target of endless manipulation to maintain ayouthful appearance. Hair graying appears to be aconsequence of an overall and speciﬁc depletionof hair bulb melanocytes, and less so in the outerroot sheath and sebaceous gland basal layer42 D.J. Tobin
[100e102]. The mechanism for this steady deple-tion remains uncertain, but appears to involve thestability and survival of melanocyte stem cells andbulbar melanocytes, especially in the context oftheir relative sensitivity to an increasingly friableoxidant/anti-oxidant protection status [103,104] .6.5. Immune functionThe skin (excluding an immune-privileged transientportion of anagen hair follicles) is a potent immune-competent tissue. The density of antigen-presenting Langerhans cells in the skin decreasesgreatly in the elderly even in sun-protected sites[105,106] . These cells also have reduced ability tomigrate from the epidermis in response to cytokineslike tumor necrosis factor- a[107] . Similarly, T lym-phocytes are reduced in number and become lessresponsive to speciﬁc antigens [42,108] . Aging skinalso appears to have a reduced ability to producecertain cytokines (e.g., interleukin-2, [109] ), whilethe production of others (e.g., interleukin-4) is
the production of others (e.g., interleukin-4) isincreased [109] . The consequence of these changesis a reduced intensity to delayed hypersensitivityreactions [8]and increased susceptibility to photo-carcinogenesis and chronic skin infections [49].6.6. WomenReduced estrogen levels in post-menopausalwomen contributes to wrinkling, dryness, atro-phy, laxity, poor wound healing, and vulvar atro-phy[110] , and loss of collagen appears to be moreclosely related to post-menopausal age thanchronologic age [111,112] . Estrogen therapy (HRT)may prevent collagen loss and can stimulate syn-thesis of collagen in those that have lower initialcollagen levels [113,114] . There is also a rela-tionship between estrogen deprivation anddegenerative changes of dermal elastic tissue[115,116] . There is some evidence that HRT im-proves skin dryness [117] and wound healing [118] ,and increases skin surface lipids [119e121].6.7. MechanismThere are several proposed modes of aging in
There are several proposed modes of aging interms of their cellular and molecular biologicmechanism(s), although it is not at all clearwhether they adequately address the primarycause(s) of aging. The production of reactive oxy-gen species (ROS) or free radicals, through UVR,smoking, pollution, and normal endogenousmetabolic processes, is thought to contribute tothe process of aging in the skin. ROS induces geneexpression pathways result in increased degrada-tion of collagen and accumulation of elastin [122] .ROS not only directly destroys interstitial collagen,but also inactivates tissue inhibitors of matrix-metalloproteases and induces the synthesis andactivation of matrix degrading metalloproteases[122] . Hormones have also been shown to play arole as post-menopausal hormone changes areresponsible for a rapid worsening of skin structureand functions, and these can be at least partiallyrepaired by HRT or local estrogen treatment[112,123] .
Mitochondrial DNA incurs regular DNA damagedue to repeated constitutional oxidative stress,and in particular deletion of a speciﬁc length ofDNA called common deletion that is 10 times morecommon in photo-damaged than in sun-protectedskin. The deletion results in further accumulationof ROS, with additional damage to the cell’s abilityto generate energy. The extent of mtDNA damagein photo-damaged skin does not correlate with thechronologic age however, but rather with photo-damage severity [20]. UVR can also acceleratetelomere shortening, and results in the activationof DNA damage response proteins such as p53, atumor suppressor protein. The latter can inducingproliferative senescence or apoptosis, dependingon the cell type [14,124] .7. ConclusionSkin is subject to a complex blend of intrinsic and
extrinsic aging processes and given its strategiclocation as an interface organ is particularlyvulnerable to environmental insults (e.g., UVR).Although there are numerous defense mechanismsto protect the skin from damage, the efﬁcacy of
to protect the skin from damage, the efﬁcacy ofthese diminishes over time, resulting in the clinicalfeatures associated with aging and the develop-ment of skin cancers.Conﬂict of interestNone declared.References[1]Tobin DJ.
