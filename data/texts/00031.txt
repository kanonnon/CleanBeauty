For this, iden-tiﬁcation of the relevant molecular controls of humanhair follicle cycling is an essential prerequisite.Section Editor:Mike P.

In
consequence,fewotherlifesciencesareassportasmanypatents– often with sweeping claims – as the ever-expanding circus ofcertiﬁed, potential or dubious ‘anti-hair loss’ agents. And yet,pharmaceutical hair loss management still occurs within aclinical theatre of Dickensian proportions: ‘great expectations’– contrasted by plenty of disappointed hopes [ 1]. Much of thatdisappointment appears to result from unrealistic expecta-tions, ill-targeted (and therefore inefﬁcient) drug therapyand insufﬁcient industrial interest in dissecting the basicmechanisms by which hair loss occurs and by which (long-recognized!) human hair growth-promoters exert their effects.Despite the plethora of patented and advertised ‘anti-hairloss’ agents, convincing evidence-based medicine still is theexception rather than the rule in this ﬁeld, and just two FDA-
approved ‘hair loss drugs’ (the dihydrotestosteron-suppres-sing 5 a-reductase inhibitor, ﬁnasteride and the antihyperten-sive potassium channel opener, minoxidil [ 2]) supremely rulein current clinical practice. Tellingly, both are children ofserendipity, not of rational hair drug design. Given the widelyunderestimated psychological burden that hair loss inﬂictsupon affected patients [ 3,4], and the limited, transient andsomewhat unpredictable efﬁcacy of ﬁnasteride and minoxidilin hair loss management [ 2,5], more and better pharmaco-logical treatment options are urgently needed. To avoidmisunderstandings, minoxidil and ﬁnasteride have beenlandmark drugs in the hair loss arena, but we cannot becontent with what we currently have.It is on this sobering background that we explore preciselytargeted strategies for rational hair loss management, criti-cally review recent developments in this arena and deﬁnespeciﬁc, as yet under-investigated research avenues that pro-
mise to be productive. Owing to their overarching clinicalimportance, we focus on androgenetic alopecia, alopeciaareata and chemotherapy-induced alopecia. Summarizingthe pathogenic principles that underlie hair loss, we alsohighlight selected lead substances whose hair growth effectsneed to be dissected much more incisively to identify noveltargets for optimized hair loss management.As hair loss mainly results from abnormalities in hairfollicle cycling, potent hair cycle-modulators areneededWhen confronted with a hair loss patient, one is well-advisedto follow established, authoritative guidelines for consideringDrug Discovery Today: Therapeutic StrategiesVol. 3, No. 1 2006Editors-in-ChiefRaymond Baker – formerly University of Southampton, UK and Merck Sharp & Dohme, UKEliot Ohlstein – GlaxoSmithKline, USASkin diseasesE-mail address: R.

and excluding the chief causes of efﬂuvium (=the dynamicprocess of excessively shedding hair shafts, usually on thescalp) and/or alopecia (=the consequence of having lost hairshafts in a deﬁned skin region) [ 5–8]. When it comes to hairloss therapy, however, the single most important challenge toclearly deﬁne the hair loss seen in a given patient results fromone or several of ﬁve basic causes ( Table 1 ).To understand this list, it sufﬁces to recollect that hairfollicles represent unique ﬁber-producing biofactories, whichconstantly undergo dramatic remodeling events, the so-called hair cycle [ 9–11 ]. During its cycle, the hair follicleswitches between phases of growth and regression. Duringthe growth phase (=anagen), which normally lasts 1–6 yearson the human scalp, pigmented keratin ﬁbers of very hightensile strength (=hair shafts) are generated in the so-calledanagen hair bulb. This contains one of the most rapidly
proliferating epithelial cell populations in the mammalianorganism (not surprisingly, these are exquisitely drug-,growth factor- and hormone-sensitive). These keratinocytessubsequently undergo terminal differentiation to becometrichocytes of the hair shaft and get injected with melaningranules produced by special melanocytes of the hair folliclepigmentary unit [ 9–12 ].Following the dictates of an as yet unknown autonomousoscillator system (‘hair cycle clock’), this ﬁber factory sud-denly involutes by massive induction of apoptosis in most ofits epithelial and melanocytic cell populations, whereas thehair shaft is transformed into a more loosely anchored clubhair and moves upwards to get eventually shed (probably inan actively controlled process: exogen). The rapidly evolvingregression phase of the hair cycle (=catagen) is then followedby a period of relative quiescence (=telogen), before a new,ﬁber-producing anagen hair follicle is reconstructed from
epithelial hair follicle stem cells located in the bulge regionof the outer root sheath of the follicle (i.e. at the level of theinsertion of the arrector pili muscle) [ 9–12 ].Hair cycle disturbances have dramatic effects on visiblehair growth. If anagen gets prematurely terminated andcatagen occurs too early, this must result in efﬂuvium andalopecia; the affected skin region will subsequently sportlargely catagen and/or telogen follicles, whose looselyanchored club hairs are eventually shed [i.e. the normalanagen/telogen rate on the scalp (roughly 4:1) changes infavor of telogen]. This is exactly what happens, for example,as a consequence of drug-induced damage to the proliferatingcells of the anagen hair bulb, for example, in drug-inducedtelogen efﬂuvium or when inﬂammatory cells attack theanagen hair bulb in alopecia areata [ 9,12].Alopecia areata perfectly illustrates how crucial hair cycledisturbances are for hair loss. This autoimmune disease prob-
ably develops in immunogenetically predisposed individualswhen the normal immune privilege of the anagen hair bulbcollapses [ 13,14 ]. Because almost exclusively anagen hairbulbs are attacked in alopecia areata lesions by an inﬂamma-tory cell inﬁltrate, disease susceptibility is tightly coupled to adeﬁned hair cycle segment (probably because the – as yetunknown – autoantigen(s) are expressed only during ana-gen). This immune attack then causes a dramatic hair cycleabnormality by abruptly catapulting anagen follicles into adystrophic catagen, and the insufﬁciently anchored, impro-perly formed hair shafts are quickly shed [ 6].As a consequence, the most effective therapeutic strategiesfor hair loss therapy in most patients with hair loss are, indeclining order of importance ( Fig. 1 ):/C15to inhibit catagen development so as to prolong anagen;/C15to induce anagen in telogen follicles;/C15to inhibit exogen.Potent catagen and exogen inhibitors as well as

inducing drug (e.g. beta-blockers, synthetic retinoids, antic-oagulants, antithyroid drugs), by treating a catagen-inducingendocrine disorder (e.g. thyroid dysfunction, hyperandro-genism, hyperprolactinemia) or by substituting a catagen-promoting deﬁciency (e.g. in serum iron, ferritin, zinc orestradiol) [ 5,6,8 ]. Where this does not apply, the pharmaceu-tical challenge is to develop potent, yet safe catagen inhibi-tors, anagen inducers and exogen blockers (additionalstrategies and considerations apply to alopecia areata, che-motherapy-induced alopecia and scarring alopecia, seebelow). Unfortunately, industry has not even fully appre-ciated the signiﬁcance of developing exogen blockers (cf.[10]) so that little is to be expected on this frontier in theimmediate future.Although both ﬁnasteride and minoxidil might indeedexert anagen-inducing and catagen-inhibitory effects inresponsive patients [ 2,17,18 ], and are reasonably safe drugs,
they are undoubtedly not very potent in this respect. Also,they exert these properties rather unpredictably, and are notprobable to affect exogen (although this remains to be prop-erly studied). In fact, in terms of their anagen-inducing andcatagen-inhibitory power, ﬁnasteride and minoxidil aredwarfed by the potent immunosuppressant, cyclosporin A(see [ 19]) (it remains one of the great mysteries of the hairVol. 3, No. 1 2006 Drug Discovery Today: Therapeutic Strategies | Skin diseasesFigure 1.

trade, why industry has not dissected much more rigorouslythe molecular mechanisms that underlie the unusuallypotent anagen-inducing, catagen-inhibitory and other hairgrowth-promoting effects of this immunophilin ligand[19,20 ] so as to target them directly with drugs that are muchless toxic than cyclosporin A!). Even 17-ß-estradiol – a verypotent hair growth-modulatory hormone that still awaitscomprehensive analysis as a key element of human hairgrowth control [ 21] – might be a more effective catageninhibitor for human scalp hair follicles [ 22,23 ] than ﬁnaster-ide and minoxidil.In short, from a strategic point of view, the two currentlyavailable FDA-approved standard hair drugs disappoint inthat they do not effectively and predictably enough targetthe three hair cycle-related key points for therapeutic inter-vention in hair loss management deﬁned above.Hair follicle miniaturization is another strategic targetfor anti-hair loss drugs
for anti-hair loss drugsAs indicated in Table 1 , besides premature anagen termina-tion, the second major pathogenic principle by which andro-gens (i.e. dihydrotestosterone) cause alopecia is that theyinduce a striking process of organ transformation: the min-iaturization of very large, well-pigmented terminal hair fol-licles in androgen-sensitive scalp regions (i.e. vertex,temporofrontal skin) into minute, unpigmented, ﬂuffy vellushair follicles [ 6].The bulk of published studies as well as daily clinicalexperience suggest that, in androgenetic alopecia in malepatients, systemic ﬁnasteride (1 mg daily per os) is mosteffective for both preventing further hair follicle miniatur-ization and reversing this unwanted transformation, slightlytrailed in efﬁciency by topical minoxidil (2% or 5%, once ortwice daily). Minoxidil is the only topically active anti-hairloss drug that is widely acknowledged to be, in principle,
capable of promoting a vellus-to-terminal hair reconversion,even in female androgenetic alopecia – albeit in a disappoint-ingly low percentage of minoxidil users (for literature review,see [2,24]). Recent studies, in essence, support this picture(e.g. [ 25–29 ]). Despite an earlier report that supports thecontrary, ﬁrst, very preliminary indications now suggest thatﬁnasteride might also be of beneﬁt in normoandrogenicpostmenopausal women with androgenetic alopecia [ 30,31 ].However, many practitioners of the trade see less satisfac-tory clinical results than the published studies lead one toexpect (e.g. [ 32]). Together with the usually very long timeperiod needed before the desired cosmetic results becomevisible to the naked eye, the large percentage of patients thatfails to show satisfactory vellus-to-terminal transformation inthe cosmetically most crucial scalp skin areas, and the need to
continue medication indeﬁnitely, this calls for the develop-ment of more effective, longer-lasting vellus-to-terminal hairtransformers than minoxidil and ﬁnasteride.It is widely hoped (but far from proven) that newer-gen-eration potassium channel openers [ 33] and 5- a-reductaseinhibitors [ 34–36 ] with higher potency will ﬁt this ticket. Ifso, it will be crucial to rigorously exclude that any increasedhair regrowth-promoting effect comes along with unaccep-tably lower drug safety. Other recent developments thatlogically follow-up the therapeutic leads provided decadesago by the androgen receptor antagonist, cyproteronacetateand other ‘ancient’ antiandrogens (with their documentedefﬁcacy in female pattern hair loss, cf. [ 37,38 ]) are the avail-ability of (a) new steroidal antiandrogens (e.g. [ 35]) and (b)new, topically applicable antiandrogen prodrugs (such as RU58841-myristate) [ 39].It is a pity, although, that neither industry nor most hair

researchers have given much attention to the mechanismsthat underlie the (supposedly androgen-driven) hair follicleminiaturization as such. Morphometric evidence suggeststhat it can occur within the course of a single human haircycle, possibly owing to a loss of inductive dermal papillaﬁbroblasts [ 40]. Indeed, in mice, very substantial trafﬁckingoccurs between these special morphogenic ﬁbroblasts (whosenumber and secretory power dictate hair bulb volume andthereby hair shaft diameter, and which might operate as the‘chief management’ of hair follicle [ 12]) and the intimatelyconnected dermal sheath ﬁbroblasts of the hair follicle: inearly anagen, dermal sheath ﬁbroblasts immigrate into thedermal papilla, whereas dermal papilla ﬁbroblasts emigrateinto the dermal sheath in catagen [ 41].Even hair follicle transformation, then, is a hair cycle-dependent phenomenon because it probably results from
the hair cycle-coupled trafﬁcking of inductive ﬁbroblasts.Androgens might tip the balance in favor of excessive ﬁbro-bast emigration from the dermal papilla during the anagen–catagen switch of the hair cycle, whereas hypertrichosis-inducing drugs like minoxidil, diazoxide, cyclosporin Aand perhaps ﬁnasteride (?) might favor the reverse processduring the telogen–anagen switch, thus increasing thevolume and morphogenic power of the dermal papilla inthe new anagen hair bulb [ 12,41 ]. None of this has beensystematically explored, although it represents one of mostpromising research avenues towards more effective hair lossmanagement! We need drugs that selectively stimulate ﬁbro-blast immigration from the connective tissue sheath into thehair follicle dermal papilla, thereby promoting vellus-to-terminal transformation of miniaturized hair follicles (andthis, ideally, as fast as cyclosporin A manages to do so).Hair follicle stem cells and hair shaft structural genes
are irrelevant targets for most hair loss patientsTable 1 indicates that other important causes for hair lossarise from irreversible damage to the epithelial hair folliclestem cells, from which the follicle regenerates duringeach new cycle, leading to permanent alopecia.

inherited or acquired defects in hair shaft structure have to beconsidered and excluded [ 2,5,9 ]. Although there have beenfew areas in skin biology that have seen such impressiveadvances throughout the past decade as the ﬁelds of hairfollicle stem cell biology [ 42–45 ] and the unraveling of mole-cular basis of structural hair defects in mice and human (e.g.[46–49 ]), this has remained practically without impact on theclinical management of the vast majority of hair loss patients.This comes as a surprise only to those who uncriticallyaccept ‘stem cells’ or ‘gene therapy’ as the ultimate cure foressentially every disorder that has proven recalcitrant totherapy. However, our patients with androgenetic alopecia,telogen efﬂuvium or alopecia areata (i.e. well over 95% of hairloss patients) – as far as we know to-date – have perfectlyhealthy hair follicle stem cells, and display no signiﬁcantstructural gene defects. Instead, their basic problems are
abnormalities in hair follicle cycling and hair follicle trans-formation. Thus, targeting structural gene defects in thefollicle is a wonderful test arena for gene therapy strategiesin general [ 50], but probably will achieve close to nothing interms of treating any of the most common hair growthdisorders of human.Likewise, targeting hair follicle stem cells is extremelypromising for regenerative medicine, and one day mighteven allow us to induce the neogenesis of human hair folliclesfrom autologous adult cells in vitro [51,52 ], but offers little (ifany) practical help for hair loss management in the routinecase. Even the completely bald scalp still sports tens ofthousands of rather healthy (although cosmetically unsatis-factory) vellus follicles [ 6,9], which are just waiting to beretransformed into terminal hair-producing ﬁber factories. Asconvincingly demonstrated by the astounding efﬁcacy ofhypertrichosis-inducing drugs (e.g. cyclosporine A), this
can be easily achieved without any stem cell or gene therapy.We just lack the pharmacological means to do so where wewant, when we desired and without using toxic agents ...!Finally, although we are delighted to learn that we aregetting ever-closer to achieving human hair follicle neogen-esis from adult hair follicle-associated cell populations[52,53 ], its advocates tend to play-down the staggering chal-lenge of having to arrange such hair follicles generated denovo in perfect geometry and alignment in order for them tobe of any cosmetic use (not to mention that few patients willbe exactly happy to watch their – very expensively acquired –new hair follicles generating hair shafts that resemble thepubic hair variant, rather than the curls of their youth ...).In any case, all this does not help to manage the mostcommon causes of alopecia and efﬂuvium. The same goes forgene therapy strategies, which do indeed offer the hope of
correcting – very rare – human genodermatoses that display ahairloss phenotype. Although these are beyond the scope ofthis review, it is interesting to note that epithelial hair folliclestem cells hold particular promise for gene transfer andreconstitution strategies [ 45,50,54 ]. As far as stem cell-tar-geted therapeutic strategies are concerned, sufﬁce it to statehere that stem cell-protective drugs are indeed badly neededin the small minority of hair loss patients where stem celldeletion is the chief pathogenic problem ( Table 1 ), that is, inscarring alopecia (e.g. as a consequence of lichen planopilaris,CDLE or SLE, scleroderma, folliculitis decalvans and radia-tion-induced alopecia) [ 9].However, very little attention has as yet been paid to howautoaggressive, inﬂammatory attacks on hair follicle stemcells might best be prevented or how the capacity of thesestem cells to recover from immunologically or radiation-
induced damage might be effectively enhanced. Interestingleads in this respect, which remain to be picked-up and
induced damage might be effectively enhanced. Interestingleads in this respect, which remain to be picked-up andsystematically developed, have arisen, for example, fromradiotherapy-induced alopecia, where prostaglandins andnitroxins might inhibit the hair loss based on stem celldestruction [55–57 ]. In addition, this very small minorityof hair loss patients would indeed proﬁt from cell-basedregenerative medicine leading to hair follicle neogenesis[52](Table 3 ) – provided that the primary pathogenic insultthat has caused hair follicle stem cell deletion in the ﬁrst placehas been eliminated or suppressed successfully beforehand(which, currently, if often not possible ...!).‘Telogen arrest’ drugs and restorers of hair follicleimmune privilege are needed in alopecia areataIt is almost exclusively anagen hair follicles that are attackedin alopecia areata (probably because the relevant autoanti-gens are expressed only in anagen and because only the
anagen hair bulb is immunologically privileged [ 14,58 ]).Vol. 3, No. 1 2006 Drug Discovery Today: Therapeutic Strategies | Skin diseasesTable 3.

Therefore, besides counter-acting inﬂammation-inducedcatagen, a complementary therapeutic strategy is to arresthair follicles in telogen. Although this would have to bebought with telogen efﬂuvium occurring some months alongthe line, this would be very effective for stopping the – oftendramatic! – disease progression. Regrettably, none of thecurrent treatment regimens for alopecia areata (e.g. gluco-corticoids, contact eczema, minoxidil) even so much as con-siders this sensible management strategy, and this author isnot aware of any systematic drug development strategygeared at identifying ‘telogen arrest’ drugs for human skin(even though these would also be immensely useful fortreating hirsutism; cf. [ 12]). In mice, potent glucocorticoster-iods [ 59] and 17-ß-estradiol [ 60,61 ] are very effective ‘telogenarrest drugs’. However, it remains to be clariﬁed whether theyhave the same effects in human scalp (this might not be thecase).
case).Although the pathogenesis of alopecia areata remainsunclear, mounting evidence suggests that this is an organ-speciﬁc, T cell-dependent autoimmune disease, in whichcollapse of the relative immune privilege of the anagen hairbulb, with the corresponding incapacity to sequestrate ana-gen-associated follicle autoantigens from immune recogni-tion, play a key role [ 14,58 ]. Current standard therapyconsists of immunosuppression by topical and/or systemicglucocorticosteroids or immune deviation therapy by indu-cing an irritant or allergic contact dermatitis [ 62] – withgenerally unpredictable and often unsatisfactory results.The underlying therapeutic strategies target primarily theinﬂammatory cell inﬁltrate, rather than hair follicle cyclingas such, and do not even attempt to re-establish tolerance tothe elusive autoantigen(s) in alopecia areata. As long as thiscardinal challenge of alopecia areata therapy cannot be met,
it would already constitute a major therapeutic advance, if wecould at least re-establish the hair follicle immune privilege inaffected patients; this would probably halt disease progres-sion and would allow the hair follicle to quickly recover frominﬂammation-induced premature catagen development[13,14 ].Very promising lead substances that might serve as guar-dians and restorers of human hair follicle immune privilegehave recently been identiﬁed in human hair follicle organculture experiments [ 13]: the growth factor IGF-1 (whichdoubles as a potent anagen promoter and catagen-suppressorfor human scalp hair follicles [ 63,64 ]), tacrolimus (the mostpowerful immunophilin ligand used in daily clinical practicefor suppressing T cell-dependent immune responses, whichalso induces anagen and suppresses catagen in mice [ 19,20 ])and the neurohormone a-MSH (a pigmentation-stimulatorymelanocortin which is even produced locally in normal
human anagen hair bulbs [ 65] and has surfaced as apotent but very well-tolerated general immunosuppressant[66–68 ]).Using state-of-the-art hair follicle-targeting vehicles [ 69],local combination therapy with these three agents or appro-priate synthetic agonists, therefore, promises a new level ofmore effective, pathomechanism-oriented alopecia areatatherapy – the novel combination of T cell-focused immuno-suppression with hair follicle immune privilege restorationand catagen suppression [ 13,14 ]. Alas, owing to lack ofindustrial interest in systematically following-up these intri-guing leads, alopecia areata patients remain stuck with thedeeply unsatisfactory treatment options available today.Chemotherapy-induced alopecia presents atherapeutic conundrumJust like in alopecia areata, catagen inhibition and telogenarrest are sensible therapeutic strategies in chemotherapy-induced alopecia for maintaining hair follicles in the least
chemotherapy-sensitive stage of the hair cycle (i.e. telogen) atthe time of chemotherapy. These strategies, however, also
induced alopecia for maintaining hair follicles in the leastchemotherapy-sensitive stage of the hair cycle (i.e. telogen) atthe time of chemotherapy. These strategies, however, alsohave serious drawbacks. A closer look at them nicely illus-trates why successful management of chemotherapy-inducedalopecia, one of the key unsolved problems in clinical oncol-ogy [ 70], has remained a genuine conundrum.Catagen inhibition would best be achieved by topicallyadministering potent inhibitors of hair follicle keratinocyteapoptosis [ 20,16,71–73 ], using, for example, new liposomalpreparations that target the hair follicle [ 69]. Lamentably,neither properly formulated apoptosis-blocking agentsnor reliable ‘telogen arrest’ drugs have as yet been developedfor topical use on human scalp – largely owing to the failureof the industry to recognize the crucial importance of doing
so if we really wish to substantially enrich our pharmacolo-gical armamentorium for treating human hair growth dis-orders.Yet, even if such agents were available, they would have tobe applied with greatest caution: one would not want toenhance tumor cell survival by administering apoptosisinhibitors or antiproliferative agents that risk to render cellcycle-dependent cytostatic agents ineffective. A similar argu-ment can be invoked against the use of cooling caps forchemotherapy-induced alopecia [ 74]( a p a r tf r o mc o o l i n gcaps often being relatively ine ffective and poorly tolerated):they reduce scalp perfusion [and thereby drug-access to scalp(micro-)metastases!] and possibly inhibit not only hairmatrix but perhaps also tumor cell proliferation, thus ren-dering the latter unresponsive or less sensitive to chemother-apy. In mice, systemic or topically applied immunophilinligands are effective suppre ssors of cyclophosphamide-
induced hair matrix keratinocyte apoptosis and subsequentalopecia [ 20,71 ]. But is it justiﬁed to risk the suppression oftumor immunosurveillance by administering such potentimmunosuppressants? In short, what might protect the hairfollicle might also aid tumor survival and growth underchemotherapy.Drug Discovery Today: Therapeutic Strategies | Skin diseases Vol. 3, No. 1 2006106 www.drugdiscoverytoday.com
Unfortunately, this is not t he only conundrum. Anotherone arises from the fact that the fastest and most efﬁcientstrategy of the hair follicle to repair chemotherapy-induceddamage is to immediately shut-off anagen by catageninduction (‘dystrophic catag en pathway’) and by runningthrough a much-abbreviated telogen phase, to reconstruct anew hair shaft factory (=anagen hair bulb) with maximalspeed, as the fastest way to promoting the regrowth ofnormally pigmented hair shaft s. Therefore, an tiapoptoticregimens, which favor the ‘dystrophic anagen pathway’might reduce the level or retard the onset of alopecia butactually protract the regrowt h of normally pigmented hair[71,75 ].This strategic dilemma can best be studied in mice. Here,the ‘dystrophic catagen pathway’ towards the most rapid hairfollicle recovery from chemotherapy-induced damage is veryeffectively promoted, for example, by topical glucocorticoids,calcitriols and 17-ß-estradiol; however, these agents also tend
aggravate the initial alopecia [ 71,75–77 ]. Although this pro-mises to accelerate normal hair growth, owing to the initial,massive promotion of catagen, this therapeutic strategy(which remains to be tested on the human scalp) probablywill greatly enhance the degree of chemotherapy-inducedalopecia, for starters. It does not take prophetic vision topredict that the number of chemotherapy patients willing toaccept a greater cosmetic evil in the beginning, for the sake ofeventual cosmetic rewards many weeks or even months later,will be small ....To identify the therapeutic strategy, and the drugs, whichmaster these formidable challenges in the pharmacologicalmanagement of chemotherapy-induced alopecia should behigh on the priority list of all serious combatant in the waragainst hair loss.Conclusions and perspectivesDespite the disappointing practical advances in pharmaco-logical hair loss management during the past decade, there ishope!
hope!Besides the standard arguments customarily invoked forthis purpose [advances in the human genome project andunraveling of ever more genetic defects of rare inherited hairloss disorders which provide novel molecular clues to well-focused drug and gene therapy, dramatic progress in hairfollicle stem cell research and in the de novo generation ofhuman hair follicles from adult cell populations (see above)]such optimism largely rests upon four pillars:1. Contrary to generations of physicians before us, the doctorconfronted with a hair loss patient, nowadays, can proﬁtfrom clear-cut, evidence-based guidelines for patient man-agement (e.g. [ 5,7,8,62 ]). If applied systematically andwith circumspection (without adhering to them slavishly),these are priceless assets.2. Today, our – once rather vague – concepts of hair losspathogenesis can be distilled into a few basic processes(Table 1 ), whose cellular and molecular basis becomes
increasingly understood and, therefore, more amenableto selective pharmacological targeting.3. Related to this, the basic strategies one can employ totackle the most common causes of hair loss have becomemore sharply deﬁned than ever before, and novel strate-gies ( Table 2 ) have been developed.4. The string of compounds claimed to hold potential as hairgrowth-promoting agents has been growing so steadilyover the past few decades that it is hard to believe that allof them will fail. Although their number is far too large todo this list of candidate hair growth modulators justiceand to discuss each individual compound crucially here,Table 3 points the interested reader to a small selection of‘hopeful new kids on the block’ and ‘old wine in newbottles’, which supplements the agents already discussedabove.The candidate ‘hair loss drugs’ listed above and in Table 3

(as well as chemically or functionally related compounds)now must be subjected to rigorous testing with respect totheir efﬁcacy as protagonists for any one of the therapeuticstrategies deﬁned in Table 2 . Ideally, this is done in humanhair follicle organ culture [ 78–82 ], so as to probe the effects ofthe test agent on human scalp hair follicle growth andregression in vitro , and by utilizing the best-established mousemodel for hair research (C57BL/6J [ 19,83 ]), so as to testprimarily the hair cycle-modulatory effects in vivo , and beforetesting the candidate agent clinically.Perhaps, this brief exploration of therapeutic strategies forhair loss is concluded most ﬁttingly with an unashamedlyeclectic outlook on three frontiers in the war against hair lossnot yet mentioned above that this author currently feels to beparticularly exciting.One of the most intriguing developments in human hairbiology is that human scalp hair follicles (especially their
epithelium) have turned out to be not only a target, but also asource for ever-more (neuro-) hormones, including CRH,ACTH, a-MSH, cortisol [ 65,84 ], melatonin [ 85] and, mostrecently, neurotrophins [ 79], prolactin [ 81], TRH and TSH[86] and even erythropoietin [ 87]. Although the full range offunctions of all these locally generated hormones for hairbiology is still unclear, many of these endogenous bioregu-lators have turned out to operate as powerful inhibitors ofhuman hair growth-regulators, at least in vitro [65,79,80 ].Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that future hair lossmanagement might proﬁt from exploiting the astoundingendo-, para- and autocrine powers of human hair follicleepithelium by selectively modulating the synthesis of locallygenerated endogenous growth modulators, for example, bydownregulating the follicular production of TGFß, p75NTRVol. 3, No. 1 2006 Drug Discovery Today: Therapeutic Strategies | Skin diseaseswww.drugdiscoverytoday.com 107
ligands, cortisol and prolactin, whereas upregulating that ofIGF-1 [ 64,65,78,79,80,81 ].Another important development is the growing body ofevidence that psychoemotional stress, at least in mice, exertsprofound hair growth-inhibitory effects [ 88–90 ] – thus vin-dicating those of our (often ridiculed) predecessors who feltthat stress can cause hair loss. Because NGF, substance P andits receptor (NK1) as well as mast cells have now been identi-ﬁed as key mediators for stress-induced inﬂammatory eventsleading to hair growth inhibition and premature catageninduction in mice [ 88–90 ], deﬁned signaling pathways andcells can be targeted pharmacologically to counteract thenegative effects of stress. Moreover, quite unexpectedly,the prototypic topical hair drug, minoxidil, is an effective‘antistress agent’ with respect to hair growth – at least if youare a mouse [ 91].Finally, because obtaining pharmacological control over
the unruly hair cycle is clinically so all-important in hair lossmanagement ( Fig. 1 ), the ancient hunt for the ‘hair cycleclock’ [ 12] is heating up with microarray-based characteriza-tion of the molecular signature of individual hair cycleswitches in mice (e.g. [ 92,93 ]) and the advent of mutant micewith primary abnormalities in hair follicle cycling, such asMsx knockout mice [ 94] or mice with a defect in the fuzzygene locus [ 95]. These recent developments hold out the hopethat, at long last, we are getting closer to striking pharma-cologically at the heart of hair loss: the elusive molecularoscillator system that drives hair follicle cycling [ 12].‘Great expectations’ might not be totally misguided, afterall ...!AcknowledgementWriting of this review was made possible by grants to R.P.from DFG and BMBF.References1 Bandaranayake, I. and Mirmirani, P.
