AbstractBackground:  Hair loss in both men and women can be a psychologically stressful condition. Dietary insufficiencyof essential micronutrients has been associated with hair health and hair loss.Objective:  The aim of this clinical trial was to investigate the safety of use and the efficacy of a food supplementcontaining L-cystine, Serenoa repens , Equisetum  extract, zinc, and vitamins (Lambdapil ® Anti Hair Loss capsules,ISDIN, Provençals, Barcelona, Spain) in improving hair loss in both women and men.Patients/Methods:  Men with androgenic alopecia and women with acute telogen effluvium were randomized toreceive two capsules per day of the test product or the placebo product during a 6 months treatment period. Hairresistance to pulling and count were measured in women and men, respectively, by pull testing andphototrichogram. The overall hair volume and overall hair appearance were assessed before and after the treatment
as were subject’s self-assessment via a standardized questionnaire.Results:  In women, the number of hairs removed in the pull test decreased earlier for test product treated groupover the 6-month period with a significantly greater decrease (p<0.05) for the treated group (12.9 at baseline vs. 6.5hairs at 6 M) compared to the placebo group (12.8 at baseline vs. 8.8 hairs at 6 M). For men, the anagen/telogenratio increased in the Lambdapil ® treated group by 22.3% over baseline (1.93 vs. 2.36 at baseline and 6 M,respectively) indicating that there were more hair in the growing phase vs. placebo treated group (1.81 vs 1.75 atbaseline and 6 M, respectively; p<0.05). The hair volume and aspect in Lambdapil ® treated group improved at 1, 3and 6 months significantly more than placebo group (p<0.05). The treatment was well tolerated.Conclusion:  Dietary supplementation with Lambdapil ® Anti Hair Loss capsules for 6-months was safe and
effective in both women and men suffering from hair loss.Keywords: Hair loss; Androgenic alopecia; Acute telogen effluvium;L-cystine; Serenoa repens ; BiotinIntroductionHair loss, represented by acute Telogen Effluvium  (aTE) in womenand androgenetic Alopecia (AGA) in men, is a frequent reason fordermatology consultation. Despite their being benign and mildconditions, the associated psycho-emotional stress may impact thesubjects quality of life, and may sometimes lead to secondarymorbidity [1-3]. The main factors contributing to psycho-emotionalstress are inability to style hair, dissatisfaction with appearance,concern about the continuing hair loss and concern about othersnoticing hair loss [4].Telogen Effluvium  (TE) is an increased loss of normal club hairsthat occurs by a perturbation of the hair cycle [5]. Whatever the causeof hair loss, it results in increased disruption of hair cycle leading tosynchronized telogen shedding. It can occur in both genders, but is
overrepresented in women [6]. aTE was first described as an acute
synchronized telogen shedding. It can occur in both genders, but isoverrepresented in women [6]. aTE was first described as an acuteonset scalp hair loss occurring 2-3 months after  a triggering event,which is unidentifiable  in up to 33% cases [6]. A number of factorshave been implicated in the causation of TE, including high fever,surgery, hospitalization, hemorrhage, changes in medication,postpartum emotional stress, seasonal variation (July to October),changes in medication and heavy metals. However, clear evidence intheir support is lacking [6].Androgenic alopecia (AGA) is the most common hair loss disorder[6]. It is characterized by the miniaturization of the large, thickpigmented terminal hair with a diameter of >0.03 mm to small, fine,non-pigmented vellus hair with a diameter of ≤ 0.03 mm [7]. In mostmen, AGA develops with a distinctive "patterned" hair-line recession[8-10]. It affects  50% of male by the age of 50 years and up to 70% of all
males in the later life [10]. It is caused by the overproduction of 5a-dihydrotestosterone (5a-DHT), a potent androgen, within the hairfollicle, specifically  the dermal papilla cells that are the main regulatorsof hair growth and are the site of 5a-DHT action [10]. It occurs afterpuberty in men with an inherent sensitivity to the effects  of androgenson androgenetic sensitive scalp hair follicles. It does not develop inmen without testosterone or in men with a genetic deficiency  of theJournal of Cosmetology & TrichologyISSN: 2471-9323Journal of Cosmetology & TrichologyNarda et al., J Cosmo Trichol 2017, 3:3DOI: 10.4172/2471-9323.1000127Research Article Open AccessJ Cosmo Trichol, an open access journalISSN:2471-9323Volume 3 • Issue 3 • 127
enzyme 5-alpha-reductase type II which converts testosterone to DHT[6].Currently two active pharmacological ingredients are approved bythe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment ofAGA, finasteride  and minoxidil. Finasteride acts by inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase and minoxidil, a potassium channel opener, hypothetically,acts by widening blood vessels and opening potassium channels, thusallowing more oxygen, blood, and nutrients to the follicles. Althoughboth have demonstrated efficacy  for the treatment of androgenicalopecia in men [6], both drugs have side effects  and are effective  inless than 50% of the patients. Moreover, some people are intimidatedby the pharmacological approach to treat a non-life-threateningdisease such as alopecia. Food supplements are a non-pharmacologicalapproach that is easy to fit into everyday routine without significantside effects  to treating this sometimes emotionally taxing condition.
In the present study we tested the efficacy  of dietary supplements incapsule form (Lambdapil ® Anti Hair Loss capsules, henceforthLambdapil® ; currently marketed by Isdin, Spain) containing a uniquecombination of plant extracts: Serenoa repens  extract, Equisetumarvense  extract, essential minerals: zinc, vitamins: B3, B5, B6, D-biotinand amino acids: L-cystine and taurine in improving the signs ofalopecia in both men and women. Serenoa repens  extract has beenreported to inhibit 5-alpha reductase activity, an enzyme involved inthe hair loss in alopecia [8]. Equisetum arvense  is a plant rich in highlybioavailable silicon which is purported to aid in improving theresilience of hair and nails [9]. Other components of the capsules suchas biotin, zinc, amino acids and vitamins are thought to contribute tothe maintenance of normal hair by normalizing protein synthesisincluding keratin and collagen synthesis which is essential for hair
growth [11]. V itamin B6 has been described to contribute to theregulation of hormonal activity [12]. This  combination of plantextracts, vitamins, trace minerals and amino acids has been designedto replenish these where a possible deficiency  might have led to a hairloss and regulating the hormonal balance to favor hair growth.The primary objective of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to assess the efficacy  of Lambdapil ® capsules indecreasing the clinical signs of hair loss in female and male subjects.Materials and MethodsStudy designThis  monocentric, prospective, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo controlled study was carried out in accordance with theDeclaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines E6(R1). The study protocol and the informed consent form wereapproved by the “Independent Ethical Committee for Non-Pharmacological Clinical trials” during its meeting on February 06 th,
2014. This  study was not registered as the tested product was a foodsupplement. All subjects provided written informed consent and aconsent release for photo publication before initiation of any study-related procedures. The study took place at Farcoderm s.r.l.dermatological facilities in San Martino Siccomario (PV), Italy.Farcoderm s.r.l. is an independent testing laboratory for in vitro  and invivo safety and efficacy  assessment of cosmetics, food supplements andmedical devices.SubjectsEligible subjects were enrolled and screened in the study under thesupervision of a board certified  dermatologist. All subjects were adultCaucasian male and females subjects aged between 18 and 65 years oldshowing the clinical signs of AGA grade II to III vertex according toHamilton Norwood scale [13] or aTE, respectively.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: i) adequate restperiod between two similar study (at least 6 months from the laststudy), ii) willingness to not use products for hair care (both topic andsystemic) likely to interfere with the product to be tested, iii)willingness to not use, during all the study period, products for haircare other than the products supplied, iv) willingness to not vary thenormal daily routine (i.e. lifestyle, physical activity, including haircut,etc.), v) subject under effective  contraception (oral/not oral); notexpected to be changed during the trial. Exclusion criteria includedpregnancy or intention to become pregnant, lactation, foodintolerances/allergy, and participation in another similar study within6 months prior to enrolling in the study, subjects unwilling or unableto comply with the requirements of the study protocol. The study
further excluded subjects using topical products or food supplementscontaining actives that could have an influence  on hair physiology.Changes in hairstyle or dyeing of the hair were not allowed during thetrial.InterventionsThe tested product was a commercially available food supplementnamed Lambdapil ® capsules (ISDIN, Provençals, Barcelona, Spain).The product composition is presented in Table 1. The placebo productwas a 100% maltodextrin capsule. Active and placebo products wereidentical in appearance without any visible difference.  Subjects wereinstructed to take both the active and the placebo products as follows:2 capsules a day in the morning at breakfast, to be swallowed as awhole with plenty of water. For the duration of the study period,subjects washed their hair using a neutral shampoo.Components Per 2 capsules %NRV* (2capsules)L-Cystine 1000 mg -Serenoa repens 100 mg -Equisetum arvense L. 7.14 mg -Silicon 0.50 mg -Zinc (zinc sulphate) 10 mg 100%

EndpointsThe primary outcome measured was the hair loss after  pull testingfor female subjects with aTE and the anagen/telogen hair ratio for malesubjects with AGA. All measurements were carried out on cleansedhair (1 day before the visit) under temperature (22 ± 2°C) andhumidity (50 ± 10%) controlled conditions. Pull test (in femalesubjects) consisted in a gentle traction exerted on a cluster of hair(approximately 60 hairs) on three different  areas of the scalp (frontal,temporal, and occipital), and the number of hairs was counted.Normally, less than three telogen-phase hairs should come out witheach pull. If at least three hairs were obtained with each pull or if morethan ten hairs total were obtained, the pull test was considered positiveand suggestive of telogen effluvium.For phototrichogram procedure (in male subjects), a transitionalarea (1.8 cm²) of hair loss between normal hair and the balding area
was defined  using a stencil template and chosen for clipping. Theclipped hairs within the target area were dyed for gray or fair hairs witha commercially available solution (RefectoCil ®, GW Cosmetics GmbH,Leopoldsdorf, Germany) in order to enhance their contrast. Thereafter,the dyed hairs were cleansed using an alcoholic solution. Digitalmacrophotographs were taken using a Nikon D300 reflex  cameradigital camera (Nikon Corporation Tokyo, Japan) equipped with amacro objective (AF-S Micro NIKKOR 60 mm f/2.8G ED, NikonCorporation Tokyo, Japan), an independent flash  system (Kit R1C1,Nikon Corporation Tokyo, Japan) and cross-and parallel-polarizedfilters.  Digital macrophotographs were taken at the time of clipping (0h) and 48 afterwards  (48 h). The resulting images were analyzed byusing NIH software.  After  identifying the same hairs in the imagestaken at 0 h and 48 h following the clipping for all the experimental
monitored times, the length of each hair was measured and thenumber of hair in the clipped area were counted. This  allowed for thecalculation of the anagen (growing)/telogen (not growing) hair ratio.The overall hair volume and overall hair appearance were assessedby the dermatologist using a 7-point clinical score scale ranging from-3 (greatly decreased or worsened) to 3 (greatly increased orimproved). The overall hair volume changes during the clinical trialwere assessed by the dermatologist on digital images.Subjects also answered a 10 question questionnaire on effect  oftreatment on aspects related to Quality of life (QoL) regarding hair loss[14]. The responses were scored according to a 7 point scale rangingfrom 1 (not affected  at all) to 7 (extremely affected).  A highernumerical score indicated a greater concern and a lower numericalscore indicated a lesser concern for the items of the QoL questionnaire.
In addition, subjects were also asked to score product efficacyaccording to a 10 points scale ranging from 1 (very poor) to 10 (verygood).Sample sizeSample size was calculated with a two-sided 5% significance  leveland a power of 80% taking into account a 20% variation of the primaryendpoints due to both inter-individual human variability and error inthe measurement techniques. A sample size of 20 subjects per groupwas necessary given an anticipated dropout rate of 20%.RandomizationA restricted randomization list was generated using PASS 11(version 11.0.8 for W indows; PASS, LLC. Kaysville, UT, USA) statisticalsoftware  running on W indows Server 2008 R2 Standard SP1 64 bitEdition (Microsoft,  USA) by a biostatistician and stored in a safe place.Randomization sequence was stratified  using the biased coins Efron’salgorithm with a 2:1 allocation ratio. The allocation sequence wasconcealed from the in site study director in sequentially numbered,
opaque, and sealed envelopes, reporting the unblinded treatmentallocation (based on subject entry number in the study). The A4 sheetreporting the unblinded treatment was folded to render the envelope

After  acceptance of the subject in thestudy the appropriate numbered envelope was opened. Anindependent technician dispensed either active or placebo productsaccording to the card inside the envelope. The study adhered toestablished procedures to maintain separation between the investigatorand its collaborators and the staff that delivered the intervention.Investigator and its collaborators who obtained outcomemeasurements were not informed on the product group assignment.Staff  who delivered the intervention did not take outcomemeasurements. Subjects, investigator and collaborators were keptmasked to products assignment.Statistical MethodsStatistical analysis was performed using NCSS 8 (version 8.0.4 forW indows; NCCS, LLC) running on W indows Server 2008 R2 64
Edition. Data normality was checked using Shapiro-W ilk W normalitytest and data shape. A p value <0.05 was considered statisticallysignificant.  Intragroup comparisons for normally distributed data(phototrichogram and pull test) were analyzed by two-way paired ttest. Intergroup comparisons for normally distributed data(phototrichogram) were analyzed by two-way unpaired t test, while fornot normally distributed data a Mann-Whitney U test was performed.Efficacy  analyses were performed on the Per Protocol (PP) population,i.e., on all subjects who completed the study without any majorprotocol violations. Intergroup statistical analysis was performed onbaseline parameters. There  were no statistically significant  differenceswere between groups. Safety analyses were performed on the Safetypopulation, i.e. on all subjects who were assigned a subject number andwho received at least one dose of study treatment. For
phototrichogram results the percent variation was calculated as themean of each single variation for each treatment group.ResultsThe study was conducted between March and September 2014. Atotal of 70 subjects, 35 men and 35 women, were randomized in thestudy, and 23 men and 23 women received the active treatment while12 men and 12 women received the placebo (Figure 1). No majordeviation was observed in the treatment regimen. All subjects wereincluded in the safety analysis data set. In general, the treatment waswell tolerated. There  was only one premature study termination in 1woman who received the active treatment, due to bloating symptoms.Demographic and baseline characteristics (Table 2) were similar acrosstreatment arms, indicating an unbiased randomization and theabsence of covariates. No significant  differences  were observedbetween the two groups (active and placebo) regarding age, scalpconditions, hair length, and hair loss related parameters. Due to early
study termination, one female subject receiving the active treatmentwas not included in the efficacy  population. Therefore  this populationcomprised 22 subjects in the active group and 12 in the placebo group.All randomized male subjects were included in the efficacy  population.Citation: Narda M, Aladren S, Cestone E, Nobile V (2017) Efficacy and Safety of a Food Supplement Containing L-cystine, Serenoa repensExtract and Biotin for Hair Loss in Healthy Males and Females.

T0-baseline, T3-3 months, T6-6months (a-b).DiscussionThere  is little doubt that nutrition influences  hair loss pathologies[15,16] and that food supplements work on several factors of thiscomplex etiology can help in the management of hair loss [17,18]. Thisrandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studied the efficacyof Lambdapil ®, a food supplement containing Serenoa Repens  andEquisetum arvense  extract (rich in silicon), vitamins (B3, B5, B6, D-Biotin), amino acids (L-cystine, taurine ), and zinc, in women with aTEand in men with AGA. aTE involves intense hair loss that usually lastsa few months but is reversible. Women seem to be more prone to thiskind of hair loss that usually happens 2-5 months after  a trigger event.Women suffering  from aTE find the condition stressful as they notice a
large number of hair being lost daily. Although aTE eventually reversesnaturally, in the present study Lambdapil ® supplementation helped thereversal of this condition in a shorter time span compared to placebocontrols as evidenced by the results from the pull test.In men with AGA, an increase of 23.4% in the anagen /telogen ratiofrom baseline to the end of the 6-month treatment period wasobserved in patients taking Lambdapil ® whereas no such increase wasobserved in the placebo group. The anagen  hair count increase after  a6-month period treatment corresponding to 6.7 new hairs in the areaof phototrichogram  which when roughly extrapolated to whole scalparea translates to 2,159 new hairs after  6 month supplementation (scalparea 580 cm2; RIVM data). In contrast, there was no increase in haircount in placebo-treated subjects, even if a negative variation (notstatistically significant)  of anagen hair count was recorded.

group are considered very relevant as are the improved score for thesubject’s self-perception of improvement in hair quality and strengthfrom the results of the survey that the subjects responded to.Although many of the components of the food supplement used inthis study are supported by scientific  literature for their use inalleviating signs of alopecia, in our knowledge this is the first report ofa controlled, randomized clinical study that reports benefits  for womenwith aTE and men with AGA with supplementation with a productthat contains these ingredients. In Morgantil  et al. a combination ofSerenoa repens  extract and gelatin-cystine via oral route, increasesignificantly  (around 25%) hair number/cm² and total hair mass/cm²vs. placebo at 30 weeks in patients with androgenic alopecia [19].Lambdapil®  oral supplements had a good safety profile  with only 1adverse event reported. Although the drug treatments for alopecia
available today are efficacious  against both male and female alopecia,they are associated with sexual and non-sexual side effects  reported inyounger men with finasteride  [20]. Oral supplements such asLambdapil®  are a practical option for persons wanting to addressalopecia but without the side effects  associated with drugs.The strength of this study was the high-level methodologyemployed: placebo-controlled, double-blind, 6-month duration study;use of digital photographs for assessments of changes in AGA.Although the research has reached its aim, there were someunavoidable limitations. Firstly, the use of the pull test to assess thechanges for aTE may be considered as a limitation, as it was describedto be a test difficult  to standardize due to the intrinsic variability of thetechnique [6]. We justify its use as the only parameter available toassess aTE in a clinical setting. Secondly, the small sample size may be
considered a limitation. Even if a priori sample size was calculated, togeneralize the results for larger groups, the study should have involvedmore participants in order to take into account possible faults of thestratified  random sampling design and the power of statistical tests.Finally, the self-assessment questionnaire is subjective. However even ifthe output of a self-assessment questionnaire is not robust itself, whenassociated to clinical/instrumental measurements it is useful tounderstand if products effects  are perceived by the subjectsparticipating in the study.In conclusion, the oral supplementation with Lambdapil ® capsules,for 6 months, was efficacious  in improving the signs and symptomsrelated to aTE in women and AGA in men, and was suitably welltolerated with negligible adverse events. It appears to be a safe andefficacious  way to address hair loss that fits in comfortably with thedaily routines of persons suffering  from this condition.Contributors
