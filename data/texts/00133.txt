The primary source of carotenoids in the human skin is diet, mainlyfruits, vegetables, and marine product, but they may originate from supplementation and topical
application, too. In the skin, they accumulate mostly in the epidermis and act as a protective barrierto various environmental inﬂuences. Namely, the skin is exposed to numerous environmental factors,including ultraviolet radiation (UVR), air pollution, and smoking, that cause oxidative stress withinthe skin with consequent premature (extrinsic) aging. UVR, as the most prominent environmentalfactor, may cause additional detrimental skin e ﬀects, such as sunburn, DNA damage, and skincancer. Therefore, photoprotection is the ﬁrst line intervention in the prevention of premature agingand skin cancer. Numerous studies have demonstrated that carotenoids, particularly β-carotene,lycopene, lutein, and astaxanthin, have photoprotective e ﬀects, not only through direct light-absorbingproperties, but also through their antioxidant e ﬀects (scavenging reactive oxygen species), as well asby regulation of UV light-induced gene expression, modulation of stress-dependent signaling, and /or
suppression of cellular and tissue responses like inﬂammation. Interventional studies in humanswith carotenoid-rich diet have shown its photoprotective e ﬀects on the skin (mostly by decreasing thesensitivity to UVR-induced erythema) and its beneﬁcial e ﬀects in prevention and improvement of skinaging (improved skin elasticity and hydration, skin texture, wrinkles, and age spots). Furthermore,carotenoids may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of some photodermatoses, includingerythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) and polymorphous light eruption(PMLE). Although UVR is recognized as the main etiopathogenetic factor in the development ofnon-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and melanoma, and the photoprotective e ﬀects of carotenoidsare certain, available studies still could not undoubtedly conﬁrm the protective role of carotenoids inskin photocarcinogenesis.Keywords: antioxidant; skin health; skin aging; skin cancer; photocarcinogenesis; oral

IntroductionSkin acts as a protective barrier against various environmental inﬂuences such as mechanicaldamage, noxious substances, microorganisms, free radicals, and ultraviolet radiation (UVR). In additionto endogenous factors, external stressors, primarily UVR, result in the alterations of the skin such asinﬂammation, impaired immune function and epidermal barrier homeostasis, photoaging, and mostimportantly the formation of various skin diseases and malignancies [ 1,2]. Due to the diverse provenhealth-promoting e ﬀects, carotenoids are along with some other nutraceuticals widely investigatedand put in the focus of interest of many scientiﬁc and health-promoting groups [ 3–7].

Antioxidants 2019 ,8, 259 2 of 19noticed a daily increase in the number of analytical techniques for carotenoids determination [ 8,9]. Dueto their vast abundance, especially in plant-derived food, they are an integral part of the human diet.Although carotenoids have never been identiﬁed as being essential for humans as long as preformedvitamin A is available through the diet [ 10,11], the increasing evidence of their important role in thebiology and human health continues to stimulate broad interest in the carotenoid ﬁeld. Consumptionof food products and supplements containing carotenoids has increased tremendously due to theirhealth- and skin-favorable or disease-preventive e ﬀects, especially in UVR protection and consequentlyin the prevention of photo-induced dermatoses and skin aging (Figure 1).Figure 1.

CarotenoidsCarotenoids are known as fat-soluble plant pigments widely distributed in nature that providediverse colors such as yellow, red, and orange to fruits and vegetables [ 12]. While they are biosynthesizedprimarily by plants and algae, as well as by fungi and bacteria, we can ﬁnd carotenoids throughoutthe animal kingdom and humans due to selective absorption along the food chain [ 13]. Theselipophilic molecules are based on the chemical structure classiﬁed as carotenes and xanthophylls [ 14].Both classes have a common C40 polyisoprenoid structure containing a series of centrally located,conjugated double bonds which act as a light-absorbing chromophore. Carotenoids that exist as pure
non-polar hydrocarbons are referred to as carotenes ( α-carotene, β-carotene, and lycopene); on thecontrary, xanthophylls ( β-cryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, astaxanthin) are more polar carotenoidsthat contain oxygen as a functional group in its structure either as a hydroxyl or keto group as the endgroup [ 15]. The presence of a polar group in the structure a ﬀects the polarity and biological functionof the compounds [ 16]. The main sources of around 50 carotenoids in the human diet are fruits andvegetables, followed by green leaves and, to a minor extent, some marine products [ 14,16–18]. Thetransport of carotenoids from the gut occurs on the uptake with chylomicrons into the lymph, followedby the circulation of lipoprotein particles in the blood, and then transportation to various target tissueswith large interorgan di ﬀerences [ 19,20]. Absorption of carotenoids in the gut is shown to be mediated
by both simple di ﬀusion, which is dependent on the concentration gradient, and facilitated di ﬀusionthrough cholesterol membrane transporters such as scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SR-B1)and a cluster of di ﬀerentiation 36 (CD 36) [ 21,22]. Till now, more than 800 carotenoids have beenidentiﬁed, but only several are found in the human organism, including α-carotene, β-carotene, lutein,and lycopene, as well as the zeaxanthin, and α- and β-cryptoxanthin [ 23–26]. Among 800 knowncarotenoids only 20 of them are studied in su ﬃcient depth; thus, it is an area with huge amount of
Antioxidants 2019 ,8, 259 3 of 19space in front of scientists. Both α- and β-carotenes, and β-cryptoxanthin are provitamin A carotenoidswith di ﬀerent percentage of provitamin A activity [ 27]. Among provitamins, β-carotene is the mostcommon carotenoid in the diet of mammals and has the highest conversion e ﬃciency to vitamin Awith no di ﬀerence between naturally occurring and chemically synthesized β-carotene. Some of theabsorbed β-carotene is cleaved by the enzyme β,β–carotene-15,15′-monooxygenase 1 (BCMO1) intotwo molecules of all- trans -retinal which can be either further reduced reversibly or oxidized. Variousfruits and vegetables are rich in carotenoids [ 28–34], especially lycopene, such as tomatoes, asparagus,pink grapefruit, guava, and watermelon. Pumpkin, carrots, sweet potatoes, mangos, and papaya aresome examples of β-carotene containing food. Oranges, tangerines, nectarines, mango, and papaya
are rich in cryptoxanthin. We can ﬁnd lutein and zeaxanthin in leafy green vegetables, pumpkins, andred peppers. Marine food like microalgae, yeast, salmon, trout, krill, shrimp, crayﬁsh, and crustaceaare known as sources of astaxanthin, a strong photoprotectant which has been attributed an enormouspotential for protecting the organism against a wide range of diseases due to its strong antioxidant andanti-inﬂammatory e ﬀects [ 35–40]. We also need to mention fucoxanthin, another marine carotenoidwith remarkable biological properties that is found in the marine macroalgae—brown seaweeds, andthe microalgae—diatoms [41].The way of food processing a ﬀects available carotenoid contents [ 42,43]. Their bioavailabilityvaries from ~10% in raw materials up to about 50% in commercial and oil-based products [ 16]. Forexample, the content of available lycopene is higher in cooked tomatoes and is also increased by
the addition of oil, such as olive oil [ 12,44]. The biological properties of carotenoids are manifold.Besides their natural role as pigments, provitamins, and photosynthetic organisms, they have beendemonstrated to possess numerous health-promoting e ﬀects as being e ﬃcient antioxidants (AOs) –by decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 3,6,45]. However, some carotenoids, especially highlyconcentrated carotenes, showed pronounced pro-oxidative e ﬀects [ 17,46,47]. It is known that singletoxygen quenching ability of various carotenoids in organic solvents increases with an increasingnumber of conjugated double bonds [ 48]. The biologically important shorter chain C40 carotenoidshave quenching rate constants half those of longer chain carotenoids such as β-carotene; e.g., in thecase of lutein with ten double bonds the quenching rate is lower than in those with 11 double bondssuch as β-carotene or zeaxanthin [49].3. Carotenoids and the Skin
3. Carotenoids and the SkinThe amount of carotenoids in the skin depends on dietary intake or supplementation, and theirbioavailability from various food [ 50]. After absorption in the gut and transportation into the skin,carotenoids accumulate mainly into the epidermis. It is thought that they are transported into theepidermis by the same prior mentioned cholesterol transporters—SR-B1 found in the basal layersbecause the epidermis is an active site of cholesterol accumulation crucial for the epidermal barrierfunction [ 51]. Due to the accumulation of carotenoids in the epidermis, in the cases of excessivecarotenoid intake, mostly β-carotene, carotenoderma occurs as yellowish discoloration of the skinbeing most obvious on the palms and soles [ 52,53]. Besides the oral route of carotenoid administration,topical application is just as important, being especially of great interest for cosmetic companies [ 54–58].
Topical application of antioxidant (AO) substances such as carotenoids is closely related to skinprotection from environmental factors and anti-aging [ 59,60]. To determine the total dermal carotenoid
protection from environmental factors and anti-aging [ 59,60]. To determine the total dermal carotenoidlevel in comparison with their respective plasma levels, Scarmo et al. [ 61] performed skin biopsies ofhealthy individuals and collected their blood samples for correlation of individual and total carotenoidcontent using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Later on, this group of authors intheir studies used less invasive methods such as a resonance Raman spectroscopy (RRS) to assesscarotenoid status in human tissues [ 62]. Based on their ﬁndings, it is suggested that β-carotene andlycopene are present in greater abundance in human skin, in comparison to zeaxanthin and lutein,possibly indicating a speciﬁc role of carotenes in human skin photoprotection. Interestingly, levelsof carotenoids in skin di ﬀer within the skin layers and the body locations with the highest levels in
Antioxidants 2019 ,8, 259 4 of 19the skin of palms, forehead, and dorsal skin [ 63]. The lifestyles of individuals also reﬂect carotenoidlevels in the skin; precisely, stressors like UVR, illness, smoking, and alcohol consumption lower theirconcentrations [ 64]. As more and more topical products and oral supplements with antioxidativeeﬀects are occurring on the market, Darvin et al. wanted to examine in vivo whether the topical,systemic or combined application of AOs /carotenoids is e ﬀective in increasing their concentrationin the skin by using non-invasive RRS [ 65]. In this study, carotenoids were applied systemically(carotenoid tablets) at physiological concentrations like those contained in a healthy diet, and topically(cream) in the concentrations corresponding to those physiologically present in healthy skin. Resultsof this study showed a statistically signiﬁcant increase of AOs levels in human skin with all forms of
treatments—topical, systemic, and combined. A combination of topical and systemic AOs inducedthe highest accumulation in the skin, which suggested that combined treatment might be an optimalform of protection of the human skin. Carotenoid levels after the end of treatment were preserved forabout two weeks following the topical application, and up to ﬁve weeks after systemic administration.These results are explained by the fact that topically applied AOs are stored in stratum corneum fora short time only due to their rapid depletion by skin desquamation, textile contact, washing, andenvironmental stress. On the other hand, the systemically applied carotenoids are stored in body fattissue and slowly release onto the skin surface with sweat and sebum. Based on these ﬁndings, it couldbe concluded that the combined topical and systemic application of carotenoids /AOs represents anoptimal form of skin protection, but we need to be aware of the importance of choosing appropriate
non-lipid formulation of topical product which does not saturate reservoir of stratum corneum , thusallowing the systemically applied carotenoids to penetrate back into the skin.4. Carotenoids in Skin PhotoprotectionPeople are constantly exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light, some less, some more, depending on theplace of living, activities, what they do for a living, hobbies, culture, but also their knowledge of theimportance of sun protection and its implementation. It has been estimated that the exposure to solarUV light is ~10% of the total available annual UVR for outdoor workers and ~3% for indoor-workingadults [ 66]. Besides its few beneﬁcial health e ﬀects, including vitamin D3 synthesis, improvement ofmood through production of endorphins, e ﬃcacy in the treatment of various skin diseases, such aspsoriasis, vitiligo, and atopic dermatitis; UVR causes many detrimental skin e ﬀects—sunburn, ocular
damage, photoaging, immune suppression, DNA damage and skin cancer [ 66–70]. Sun exposureresults in photoaging—solar elastosis, skin roughness, furrows, and wrinkles by the mechanisms ofmitochondrial deletion and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) mediated through matrixmetalloproteinases (MMP) which cause the damage of collagen and elastin ﬁbers [ 71]. Most importantly,UVR plays the main role in photo-induced carcinogenesis, melanoma, and non-melanoma skin canceroccurrence [ 69]. Most of the harmful e ﬀects of UVR are mainly mediated by oxidative stress which alterssignal transduction pathways such as the nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF- κB)/p65mitogen-activatedprotein kinase (MAPK), the janus kinase (JAK), signal transduction and activation of transcription(STAT), and the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), causing the damage to biomoleculesand a ﬀecting the integrity of skin cells leading to skin damage [ 71]. UVR also induces pro-inﬂammatory
genes and causes immunosuppression by reducing the number and activity of the epidermal Langerhanscells [72].
genes and causes immunosuppression by reducing the number and activity of the epidermal Langerhanscells [72].Many skin diseases form as a result of pathological processes induced by photo-oxidative damage.UVA radiation, which contributes to up to 95% of total UV radiation, does not interact with DNA;however, it is considered the most important source of oxidative stress in human skin. As UVAradiation penetrates the deeper dermis, it plays a signiﬁcant role in photoaging [ 73]. On the otherhand, UVB radiation is mainly absorbed by keratinocytes in the epidermis and interacts directly withDNA, causing mutations and skin cancer [ 69,71]. UVB is the leading cause of sunburn, erythemaresulting from an inﬂammatory response to the photodamage of the skin [ 74]. In the last decade it hasbeen discovered that visible light (400–700 nm) causes solar erythema, thermal damage, induces the
Antioxidants 2019 ,8, 259 5 of 19melanogenesis in human skin [ 75] but also contributes to signs of premature photoaging by inducingproduction of ROS, proinﬂammatory cytokines, and MMP-1 expression [ 76]. Additionally, visible lightexposure is related to the pathogenesis of some photodermatoses [77].Photoprotection, either mechanical or pharmacological, is the ﬁrst line in the prevention ofphotoaging and skin cancer. Pharmacological photoprotection can be topical or systemic. The mainprinciple of photoprotection is the direct absorption of UV light using suitable compounds. There is anincreasing interest in the area of skin protection from UV and visible light by additional endogenousprotection by dietary micronutrients with AO properties such as carotenoids, vitamin C and E, andpolyphenols [ 78–81]. Skin photoprotection by nutritional means [ 54,63,82–85] or topically-appliedphytochemicals has been examined by various authors [ 86,87]. Human interventional studies have
documented photoprotective e ﬀects of many carotenoids, particularly β-carotene, but also lycopene,lutein, and astaxanthin, provided through topical application, or orally, either by a carotenoid-richdiet or by supplementation, but rather long treatment periods with a minimum of 10 weeks wererequired [ 37,47,59,79,88,89]. Most of the carotenoids exhibit absorbance maximum at wavelengthsin the range of visible light. However, noncolored carotenoids phytoene and phytoﬂuene have highUV absorption maxima that cover both UVB and UVA range. Lutein and zeaxanthin may protectthe skin from blue light, which makes them useful in the prevention or treatment of melasma andin ocular protection. [ 90–93]. Besides direct light-absorbing properties, carotenoids and some othermicronutrients provide endogenous photoprotection and contribute to the prevention of UV damagein humans mostly by their well-known AO e ﬀects—scavenging ROS, including excited singlet oxygen
and triplet state molecules which would lead to photoinactivation of AO enzymes, lipid peroxidation,and DNA damage induction [ 63,71,78,94]. Additionally, they interfere with UV light-induced geneexpression by multiple pathways, modulate stress-dependent signaling, and /or suppress cellular andtissue responses like inﬂammation [ 63,95–97]. The idea of endogenous photoprotection implies that theactive compound is available in su ﬃcient amounts at the target site [ 63]. That is why structural featuresof carotenoids are important because they inﬂuence pharmacokinetic parameters like absorption,distribution, and metabolism and a ﬀect the level of the active compound in the skin [11,98,99].Interventional studies in humans with carotenoid-rich diet have shown its photoprotective e ﬀectson the skin, mostly by decreasing the sensitivity to UV radiation-induced erythema. See Table 1.

Antioxidants 2019 ,8, 259 7 of 194.1. LycopeneLycopene is considered the most e ﬃcient dietary carotenoid when it comes to quenching singletoxygen in organic solvents [ 145]. Its quenching e ﬃcacy is, in this case, greater than all C40 carotenoidsand twice greater than the one of β-carotene. On the contrary, others state that lycopene is onlyslightly more e ﬃcient than β-carotene and that in more biomimetic environments, such as micellesand liposomes, lycopene, and β-carotene have rather similar quenching abilities [ 49]. There are alsohuman cell protection studies of lycopene on oxidant-induced damage, demonstrating its beneﬁcialAO e ﬀects and strong protection role in comparison with other carotenoids [146–148].Stahl et al. [ 149] conducted an interventional study to investigate whether intervention with anatural dietary source rich in lycopene protects against UV-induced erythema in humans. They found
that ingestion of tomato paste (40 g per day, equivalent to 16 mg lycopene per day) with 10 g of olive oilover ten weeks led to 40% reduction of skin erythema induced by exposure to solar-simulating UVR. Nosigniﬁcant protection was found after four weeks of dietary intervention, but after ten weeks, erythemawas signiﬁcantly lower than in the control group receiving olive oil only. Rizwan et al. [ 87] previouslyconducted a similar study where they also examined whether ingestion of 55 mg tomato paste in oliveoil daily over 12 weeks can protect human skin against UVR-induced e ﬀects—erythema, changes inECM, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. UVR-induced erythema was assessed visually as theminimal erythemal dose (MED) but also quantitatively with an instrument pre-and-post nutrition richin lycopene. To demonstrate UVR-induced ECM changes, and mtDNA damage, partially mediatedby oxidative stress, they performed skin biopsies from unexposed and UVR-exposed skin before and
after the nutritional intervention. Skin samples were further analyzed immunohistochemically forMMP-1, ﬁbrillin-1, and procollagen I, and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for mtDNAbp deletion. Based on these and previously-mentioned study results, it is reasonable to conclude thatthe consumption of food rich in lycopene protects against acute and potentially longer-term aspectsof photodamage.4.2. LuteinLutein is also an e ﬃcient singlet oxygen quencher, though it is less e ﬃcient thanlycopene and β-carotene [ 145,150]. Besides the well-examined photoprotective role of lycopene,Grether-Beck et al. [ 79] wanted to investigate the skin protective e ﬀects of lutein against UVR ona molecular basis. Their double-blind, randomized, controlled study added a fact that besideslycopene-rich tomato nutrient complex (TNC), lutein protects from UVA /B- and UVA1-induced geneexpression in human skin. Assuming the role of heme-oxygenase 1, intercellular adhesion molecule
1 (ICAM-1) and MMP-1 mRNA as indicators of oxidative stress, photodermatoses, and photoaging,these study results indicate that TNC and lutein could protect against UVR-induced skin damage.4.3.β-CaroteneMost studies that describe the role of carotenoids in photoprotection investigated thephotoprotective role of β-carotene and its e ﬀectiveness in the prevention of UV-induced erythemaformation, being especially useful in the treatment and prevention of some photodermatoses, namelyEPP and PMLE [ 83,88,89,100,113,114,151,152]. Systemic photoprotective e ﬀects of this provitamindepend both on the dose and the duration of treatment. In most of the interventional studies withcarotenoids, photoprotection was observed only after a minimum of 10 weeks of dietary intake orsupplementation, with doses >12 mg /day [ 89,101,153]. A su ﬃciently long period of treatment is neededto provide optimal photoprotection of the skin. The photoprotective role of β-carotene is fortiﬁed also
to provide optimal photoprotection of the skin. The photoprotective role of β-carotene is fortiﬁed alsoin vitro by the ﬁndings that its supplementation signiﬁcantly reduces the rate of mtDNA mutation inhuman dermal ﬁbroblasts after UVR [ 117]. However, the need for caution with isolated β-carotenesupplementation was pointed up after human interventional trials that had demonstrated potentiallyharmful e ﬀects of high dosages of this carotenoid and raised a discussion on suitable dose amounts
Antioxidants 2019 ,8, 259 8 of 19for photoprotection. In two long-term interventional trials in individuals at high risk for cancer(cigarette smokers and asbestos workers) who received β-carotene for several years at doses of 20 and30 mg /day, there was an ~20% increase in the incidence of lung cancer [ 6,154]. The authors concludedthat the e ﬀects of higher doses of β-carotene in cancer pathogenesis could partly be explained bythe formation of eccentric cleavage products of β-carotene, which can interfere with the retinoic acidreceptor-mediated signaling pathway [ 27]. Despite these interventional trials results, dermatologistsare still encouraged to recommend β-carotene supplements for photoprotection, especially in patientswith EPP , photosensitive diseases, and to reduce the phototoxic damage caused by some drugs [155].4.4. AstaxanthinIn recent years, much attention has been put on the health and skin beneﬁts of astaxanthin [ 35].
Astaxanthin, a marine pigment, is mostly produced by the microalga Haematococcus pluvialis to protectits cells from sun radiation, UV-light, and oxidation [ 156]. Camera et al. [ 37] conducted a studyin which they examined the modulation of UVA-related injury by astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, andβ-carotene for systemic photoprotection in human dermal ﬁbroblast. In this study, astaxanthin showedsigniﬁcant photoprotective e ﬀect and counteracted UVA-induced alterations to a greater extent. Theuptake of astaxanthin by dermal ﬁbroblasts was higher than that of other two carotenoids, which ledto the assumption that the antioxidative photoprotective e ﬀect of astaxanthin was stronger than of theother substances. Other in vitro studies fortiﬁed the photoprotective role of astaxanthin by showingthat it could interfere with UVA-induced MMP-1 and skin ﬁbroblast elastase /neutral endopeptidaseexpression [135,157].4.5. Fucoxanthin
expression [135,157].4.5. FucoxanthinSimilar to astaxanthin, orange-colored pigment accumulated by marine plants, which has AOand provitamin A e ﬀects, fucoxanthin, shows a protective e ﬀect against UVB-induced skin damageby decreasing intracellular ROS [ 40,158]. Matsui et al. suggest that this skin sun-protective e ﬀectmay be due to the restoration of ﬁlaggrin and promotion of skin barrier formation, unrelated to AOaction [ 159]. As inherited or acquired ﬁlaggrin deﬁciency substantially contributes to the pathogenesisof atopic dermatitis, fucoxanthin might be useful in its and similar conditions treatment. Besides thesun-protective e ﬀect, fucoxanthin exhibits anti-pigmentary activity in UVB-induced melanogenesiseither by oral or topical route of application presumably by the suppression of melanogenic stimulantreceptors and prostaglandin E2 synthesis [160].5. Carotenoids and Photocarcinogenesis
5. Carotenoids and PhotocarcinogenesisBased on the above statements of the skin photoprotective role of carotenoids, a question abouttheir relationship with skin cancer incidence pops up. Regardless of their proved role as agents thatprevent skin cancer in vitro and in animal studies; human interventional or epidemiological studiesregarding the e ﬀect of carotenoids on the incidence of UV-induced skin cancer are lacking (see Table 1).However, the study conducted by Heinen et al. [ 142] among Australian population showed that highdietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin was related with a decreased incidence of SCC in persons whohad a history of skin cancer.6. Carotenoids and Skin AgingA healthy diet based on large amounts of fruits and vegetables is known to be beneﬁcial in theprevention of skin aging, especially photoaging, as it increases the concentration of AOs in the bloodand the skin substantially [65,161–164].
Antioxidants 2019 ,8, 259 9 of 196.1. LycopeneMeinke et al. [ 164] measured the blood and skin levels of the carotenoids in individuals afteroral administration of natural kale extract, or placebo oil, for four weeks. Carotenoid bioaccessibilitywas evaluated using RRS on the forehead skin and the palm. For the analysis of the blood serum,the standard HPLC method was employed. In this study, carotenoids’ bioaccessibility increasedsigniﬁcantly in both skin and serum, but increases in the skin were delayed when compared with serumlevels and depended on the dermal area as well as on the type of carotenoid. Lycopene bioaccessibilityincreased more in the skin compared to the blood, which indicates that the natural kale extract stabilizesthe AO network in the skin. Carotenoids’ levels decreased signiﬁcantly faster in the blood than in theskin after the end of supplementation, which may indicate a peripheral bu ﬀer function of the skin for
carotenoids. It is shown that individuals with a higher concentration of lycopene in the skin have asigniﬁcantly smaller amount of wrinkles and furrows than individuals with lower concentrations whichfortiﬁes the protective role of lycopene when it comes to pro-oxidative damage [ 101,123]. It has alsobeen demonstrated that the skin roughness is reduced after systemic application of carotenoids [ 44,165].6.2. Lutein and ZeaxanthinSome studies have examined the e ﬃcacy of lutein and zeaxanthin, found naturally in the skin,upon several skin physiology parameters. A group of Italian authors [ 54] designed randomized,double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week clinical multicenter study to evaluate the e ﬀect of luteinand zeaxanthin administered both orally and topically upon human skin of forty healthy middle-agedwomen that exhibited signs of premature skin aging. The study results showed that the provision
of the previous two carotenoids ensures multiple beneﬁts to the skin. Besides the prevention ofUVR-inducible damage, these xanthophylls also improved skin features—skin hydration, elasticity,and increased skin surface lipids. These beneﬁcial skin e ﬀects were achieved regardless of whetherboth xanthophylls were administered topically or orally, which demonstrates that the simultaneousadministration of these carotenoids by both routes could result in greater skin health. Similar ﬁndingswere observed in a study observing the skin e ﬀects of only zeaxanthin both topically and /or orally [ 144].Meinke et al. recently fortiﬁed their prior ﬁnding of the beneﬁcial role of carotenoids in the preventionof skin aging by showing that a natural carotenoid-rich extract could prevent the aging-related collagenI degradation in the dermis and improve the ECM [ 166]. In their study, 29 healthy middle-aged female
volunteers received a supplement in the form of a carotenoid-rich natural curly kale extract containing1650 µg of carotenoids in total (three capsules of 550 µg), once a day for up to 10 months. Their skin wasexamined in vivo using noninvasive RS-based scanners and two-photon tomography for determinationof skin carotenoids before, after ﬁve months, and after ten months of daily supplementation. Theresults showed a signiﬁcant increase in skin carotenoids and the collagen I /elastin aging index of thedermis proportional to the duration of carotenoid supplementation.6.3.β-CaroteneCompared to a vast number of experimental studies investigating the e ﬀectiveness of β-carotenein the prevention of UV-induced erythema and skin photodamage, there are only a few clinical studiesinvestigating its role in photoaging. One of them is a Korean study in which was conducted with theaim to determine the e ﬀects of 90 days supplementation with two di ﬀerent doses of dietary β-carotene
(30 and 90 mg /day) on UV-induced DNA damage in human skin in vivo , procollagen type I, MMP-1,and ﬁbrillin-1 gene expression, and skin elasticity and wrinkle formation [ 167]. Their ﬁndings led
(30 and 90 mg /day) on UV-induced DNA damage in human skin in vivo , procollagen type I, MMP-1,and ﬁbrillin-1 gene expression, and skin elasticity and wrinkle formation [ 167]. Their ﬁndings ledto a conclusion that low-dose β-carotene supplementation prevents and repairs photoaging, whichreﬂects as improvement in facial wrinkles and elasticity. However, other clinical studies have failed toconvincingly demonstrate its beneﬁcial e ﬀects [168].
Antioxidants 2019 ,8, 259 10 of 196.4. FucoxanthinFucoxanthin may be an active ingredient of cosmeceuticals and nutraceuticals used in theprotection of the skin from photoaging [ 169]. Its beneﬁcial role in skin aging protection is basedon the ﬁndings of Urikura et al. [ 170] which demonstrate that fucoxanthin signiﬁcantly suppressedUVB-induced wrinkle formation, epidermal hypertrophy, MMP-13, vascular endothelial growthfactor (VEGF) and the increase of other reactive substances in the UVB-irradiated animal model ofhairless mice.6.5. AstaxanthinAs we mentioned in the previous section, astaxanthin is among the carotenoids considered tobe a potent skin protective nutrient due to its natural capacity to protect cells from irradiation andoxidation, proven to prevent or minimize the signs of UVB-induced skin damage but also UVA-inducedphotoaging such as skin wrinkling or sagging by topical or oral administration routes [ 35,37,133,157].
Several human studies, which were later conﬁrmed in animal studies [ 135,171], demonstrated thatastaxanthin, in addition to improvement of the appearance of wrinkles, also improved skin elasticity,moisture, age spots, and skin texture [ 172,173].In vitro studies have demonstrated that astaxanthinimproves the function of mitochondria and has protective e ﬀects on human skin ﬁbroblasts by exhibitingother biological functions rather than AO, including e ﬀects on gap junctional communication importantfor homeostasis, growth control, and development of cells [ 174]. In that way, it can protect skin cellsfrom ROS and preserve the collagen, which results in the smooth and youthful appearance of the skin.Based on the results of numerous studies, it is reasonable to conclude that astaxanthin supplementationhas promising functional improvements to the skin and that it can help reduce the skin aging process(see Table 1).7. Future Perspectives
(see Table 1).7. Future PerspectivesAvailable data on the protective e ﬀects of carotenoids on human skin may encourage theirimplementation in the ﬁeld of dermatology as nutraceuticals, cosmeceuticals, and photoprotectants.Due to their antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory, and immunomodulatory e ﬀects, the optimal supplyof these micronutrients increases dermal defense against UVR, maintains longer-term protection,alleviates certain photodermatoses, and contributes to better skin health and appearance. Hopefully,besides their beneﬁcial role in reducing late e ﬀects of UVR such as photoaging, carotenoids may behelpful in the treatment of inﬂammatory skin diseases like atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. If so, theiruse could be beneﬁcial at a population level or at least in those perceived to be at high risks, such asoutdoor workers, immunosuppressed patients, patients with various photodermatoses other than
PMLE, EPP , and porphyria cutanea tarda, but also ones requiring repeated courses of phototherapy. Inpractice, advice on achieving a proper intake of protective carotenoids should probably emphasizenatural food sources rather than supplements. As the diet rich in fruits and vegetables is already beingencouraged in many countries due to its various protective health e ﬀect, it should be a public healthmessage in each state. As nanotechnology is a promising ﬁeld of research for the development ofnutrient delivery systems, future interventions in the area of carotenoid micronutrition and cosmeticswould be of beneﬁt for dermatology patients. E ﬀorts are also needed to enhance the knowledge ofalready known and still undiscovered health-promoting e ﬀects of various carotenoids along with otherantioxidants, but also in the development of new topical and systemic photoprotective drugs. Wehope that the application and advancements in nutritional and topical skin protection, and in new
technologies will enable us to utilize more knowledge of the skin protective e ﬀects of carotenoids whenapproaching our patients.
