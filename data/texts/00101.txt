National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USAXeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an autosomal reces-sive photosensitive disorder with an extremely high in-cidence of UV -related skin cancers associated withimpaired ability to repair UV -induced DNA damage.There are seven nucleotide excision repair (NER)complementation groups (A through G) and an NERproﬁcient form (XP variant). XPA, B, D and G pa-tients may also develop XP neurological disease. Thelaboratory diagnosis of XP can be performed by auto-radiography. Recently, the isolation and characteriza-tion of the genes responsible for XP have made itpossible to use molecular biological techniques to di-agnose XP patients, for carrier detection and for pre-natal diagnosis, especially in Japanese XPA patients.These techniques include polymerase chain reaction(PCR) and plasmid host cell reactivation assays withcloned XP genes. DNA damage is not repaired by theNER system equally throughout the genome. There
Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an autosomal reces-sive disease characterized by severe photosensitivity,abnormal pigmentation and a more than 1000-fold in-crease in the frequency of all types of major skin cancers(basal cell cancers, squamous cell cancers, malignantmelanoma) in areas exposed to sunlight compared to nor-mal population (1). The age of onset of the ﬁrst skin can-cers is 50 years younger than in the general population(2). The estimated frequency of the disorder is 1 per mil-lion and 1 per 40 000 ¶100 000 newborns in W estern
countries and Japan, respectively. As patients with XP arevery sensitive to ultraviolet (UV), not visible light, the an-terior portion of the eye, lips and the tip of the tongue arealso affected in some cases. (The posterior portion of theeye receives only visible light since UV is blocked by thecornea and lens.) About 20–30% of patients with XP haveXP neurological disease such as mental retardation, sen-sorineural deafness, abnormal motor function (spasticity)and a-(-hypo-) reﬂexia, in association with a primary pro-gressive neuronal degeneration (3).47are two DNA repair pathways: 1) transcription-
47are two DNA repair pathways: 1) transcription-coupled repair, and 2) global genome repair. Manyfactors involved in these pathways are related to thepathogenesis of XP and a related photosensitive dis-ease, Cockayne syndrome. Clinical management con-sists of early diagnosis followed by a rigorous programof sun protection including avoidance of unnecessaryUV exposure, wearing UV blocking clothing, and useof sunblocks on the skin. Although there is no curefor XP , the efﬁcacy of oral retinoids for the preventionof new skin cancers, local injection of interferon, andthe external use of a prokaryotic DNA repair enzymehave been reported.Key words: CAT assay; DNA damage; DNA repair;host cell reactivation; skin cancer; ultraviolet radi-ation.Cultured cells derived from XP patients have shown hy-persensitivity to killing by UV irradiation, reduced DNArepair capacity and high frequency of UV -induced muta-tions. Cell fusion technique has revealed seven comple-
mentation groups, A through G, of impaired excision re-pair type and one excision repair proﬁcient form (XP vari-ant) with deﬁcient post-replicational repair (4). Amongthese groups, the clinical ﬁndings such as the frequencyof skin cancer and the severity of the neurological abnor-malities differ (4).Table 1 shows the characteristics of each comple-
Table 1 shows the characteristics of each comple-mentation group of XP . The total number of patients withXP in Japan is very high compared to non-Japanese coun-tries. In comparison with non-Japanese patients (4), theXP group A is especially predominant, representing theseverest form of XP in Japan. The XP group F and XPvariants are also more common in Japan than other coun-tries. Complementation groups assignments were deter-mined for 291 Japanese XP patients by the genetic com-plementation test or molecular biological methods.

(1). Numbers inparentheses are the registered cases with XP in Japan.Among them, 161 cases (55%) belong to XP group A and
about 25% are XP variants. The early diagnosis of XPgroup A is very important in dermatology and pediatricsfor the care of progressive cutaneous and neurologicalsymptoms in XP patients. Among the eight types of XP ,patients with groups A, B, D and G of XP may have pro-gressive neurodegenerative symptoms (Fig. 1). The patho-genesis of the neurological abnormalities in XP awaitsclariﬁcation because of the difﬁculty of culturing nervecells from XP patients and because no abnormalities ofcentral and peripheral nervous systems have been foundin XP mice (5). There is evidence that some XP patientshave an impaired ability of base excision repair (BER),which is essential for the repair of non-bulky DNA dam-age induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (e.g. thy-mine glycols, 8-oxoguanine) (6, 7). Various kinds of ROSare generated through the metabolic and respiratory path-way. The decreased BER ability might explain some of theneurological symptoms in XP .
In W estern countries most of the XP patients belong toXPC. This group often has severe cutaneous lesions, with-out any neurological ﬁndings, if they do not protect theirskin from the sun (Fig. 1). The distribution of XP geno-types differs greatly between Asians and Caucasians.Mechanism of repair of UV -induced DNAdamageUV irradiation causes two major photoproducts in DNA;cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and (6–4) pyrim-idine-pyrimidone photoproducts (6–4PP). These DNAlesions inﬂuence cellular death, aging, mutagenesis andcarcinogenesis when they are not fully corrected by theDNA repair machinery of the cells.The nucleotide excision repair (NER) system is mainlyresponsible for correcting UV -induced damage in DNA.Many factors are involved in this system, several of whichare also related to the transcription of mRNA (8).The photoproducts are not randomly repaired by NER
48throughout the genome. Lesions in the regions in DNAthat are actively transcribed by RNA polymerase II arerepaired more rapidly and more completely than those inthe global genome or in the non-transcribed strand of ac-tive genes. The former is called transcription-coupled re-pair (or TCR) and the latter, global genome repair (orGGR) (8). At the initial recognition of DNA damage,CSA and CSB protein are important in TCR and XPC-hHR23B is a speciﬁc factor in GGR. XPA, TFIIH, repli-cation protein A (RPA) and damaged DNA binding pro-tein (DDB) are related both in TCR and GGR. DDB isa heteroduplex protein and one part of it (DDB2, p48) isdefective in some XPE patients (9).Once the photoproducts appear in DNA, the GGR-
Once the photoproducts appear in DNA, the GGR-NER pathway begins with the initial recognition of DNAdamage by XPC-hHR23 complex, followed by the com-plete recognition by the XPA–RPA complex. This com-plex can combine with TFIIH, a transcription factor con-taining two kinds of DNA helicase activity: XPB andXPD with opposite direction (3 ¿È5¿,5¿È3¿, respectively).These play a role in the unwinding of double strand DNA.Fig. 1. Clinical disorders and molecular defects in DNArepair.

Xeroderma pigmentosumAfter the recognition of the DNA damage, two endo-nucleases – XPF-ERCC1 and XPG – make incisions 5 ¿-and 3 ¿to the lesion, releasing a 25 ¶27 nucleotide DNAfragment containing the photoproduct. The resulting gapcan be ﬁlled in a process involving DNA polymerases, e/d,proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and replicationfactor C (RFC), followed by sealing with DNA ligase I.This NER pathway removes the damaged DNA and re-stores the normal DNA sequence (10).Classical diagnosis of XP by DNA repair testsThere is marked clinical heterogeneity among XP groups(Fig. 1). A precise diagnosis in cases of possible XP shouldbe made as early as possible for the quality of life of pa-tients. Extensive protection from sunlight and intensivecare by specialists in various ﬁelds (dermatology, pedi-atrics, ophthalmology, orthopedics, dentistry, as well asschool teachers) are often necessary.The diagnosis of XP has been made by DNA repair
tests such as the measurement of post-UV unscheduledDNA synthesis (UDS), UV survival by colony formationand the analysis of the recovery of post-UV DNA/RNAsynthesis, based on the ﬁrst discovery by Cleaver in 1968(11). Complementation groups have been assigned by so-matic cell fusion using polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Fig.2). Cells in different complementation groups correct thereduced post-UV UDS in heterokaryons formed by fusingskin ﬁbroblasts from two different patients. Cells from pa-tients with the same defect (same complementation group)do not show this correction. Although this assay is re-liable, it usually takes several months to determine thecomplementation group of XP . Further, this assay re-quires complicated techniques and the availability of rarestrains of each XP complementation group. The comple-mentation groups of dozens of XP patients have been as-signed by this method, but it is not easy to handle manysamples in the laboratory at once.
Fig. 2. Schematic diagram of genetic complementationtest as a classical method for the diagnosis of XP by cellfusion technique with polyethylene glycol (PEG).49Molecular diagnosis of XPDiagnosis of XPA by PCRA human gene responsible for XP group A was isolatedin Japan (12, 13). The XPAC gene is 25 kb long and con-tains 6 exons. The protein has zinc ﬁnger domains, whichserve to bind DNA. T wenty-one Japanese XPA cell lineswere analyzed but only three sites of mutations in XPACgene were recognized (14–16). At present, there are at leastnine types of XPA genotypes in Japan. However, the typesof mutation in XPAC gene are varied and the sites ofmutation are more randomly distributed in non-Japanesepatients (16, 17).Surprisingly, more than 90% of the Japanese XPA pa-tients are homozygous or heterozygous for a G ÈC trans-version at the 3 ¿splice acceptor site in intron 3, which
causes abnormal splicing. Conveniently, this mutationcreates a new cleavage site for a restriction enzyme,AlwNI. This mutation can be easily and rapidly detectedby restriction fragment length polymorphism (or RFLP)of the PCR ampliﬁed DNA fragment of the XPAC geneafter being digested by AlwNI using patients’ blood cellsor skin specimens. W e can thus conﬁrm the diagnosis ofXP group A without the complementation test (18, 19).Of 99 Japanese XPA cases that we could examine in theliterature or in our laboratory, 72 (78%) patients werehomozygous and 12 (8%) heterozygous for this mutation.The second most common mutation found in Japanese
The second most common mutation found in JapaneseXPA cases is a nonsense mutation of exon 6, which altersthe 228th Arg codon to a stop codon. This mutation alsocreates a new restriction site for HphI and can be detectedby PCR-RFLP . W e have found two homozygotes and nineheterozygotes for the mutation of HphI site in exon 6.Japanese patients with this mutation have less severe clin-ical disease than patients with the more common XPAmutation of the AlwNI site.The third mutation is a nonsense mutation of exon 3,
The third mutation is a nonsense mutation of exon 3,which alters the 116th T yr codon to a stop codon. Thismutation causes a new MseI site and can be examinedeasily by the same way. W e have one homozygote andthree heterozygotes for this mutation.The fourth mutation was found in a Japanese XPAcase, XP2NI (20), which creates a new MaeII site in exon5. This patient is compound heterozygote who also hasthe more common AlwNI site mutation in intron 3. Thismutation causes abnormal splicing and there are three ab-errant mRNAs, all of which are unstable. Recently, an-other new mutation was found in a Japanese XPA patient(XP27OS) with chromosomal translocation in exon 5,which is not recognized by any restriction enzyme. Thispatient is heterozygous for this mutation and the AlwNIsite mutation in intron 3 (21).In Japan we can diagnose most Japanese XPA patientseasily, rapidly and precisely by PCR-RFLP using several

Moriwaki & Kraemerrestriction enzymes. PCR-RFLP is very useful not onlyfor the diagnosis of patients but also for genetic counsel-ing. Early prenatal diagnosis can be performed with fetalamniotic ﬂuid chorionic villi as a source. The PCR-RFLPmethod using these restriction enzymes is also useful forthe prenatal diagnosis and the detection of XPA carriersand might be useful to assess the skin cancer risk in theJapanese general population.The PCR-SSCP (single-strand conformation poly-morphism) method, established in 1989 (22), may be use-ful to ﬁnd a new mutation in XP patients (20). It, too,is rapid, easy and reliable, though it requires the use ofradioactive material. The single strand conformation andresulting mobility in the SSCP gel is reﬂected by the DNAsequence; therefore a mutation of a single base changemay be seen as mobility shifts in the gel during electro-phoresis.In American and European cases, mutations are de-
In American and European cases, mutations are de-tected at different sites in the XPAC gene than in Japanesecases. Some of these have a deletion in XPAC gene andsome have a point mutation but no convenient restrictionsite and there is no mutational hot spot (16, 17). Interest-ingly, there is the high p revalence of the mutation in exon6 of XPAC gene in T unisian patients with XPA (23).Table 2 is a summary of the types of mutations in theXPAC gene in Japanese XPA patients. There are at leastnine patterns of mutation in the XPAC gene in JapaneseXPA patients: 78% have a homozygous mutation at theAlwNI site and 16% have a heterozygous mutation at theAlwNI site. Thus AlwNI RFLP can be used for detectionof about 95% of Japanese XPA cases.Diagnosis of XP by plasmid host cell reactivation (HCR)PCR-RFLP in DNA from XP patients is useful for mostJapanese XPA patients. However, other sensitive andrapid methods are often necessary to diagnose XPB–XPGpatients and non-Japanese XPA cases.

HCR utilizes an ultraviolet(UV)-treated plasmid containing the sequence of a re-porter gene such as chloramphenicol acetyltransferase(CAT) and has been used in several laboratories (24, 25).The plasmid, pRSVcat, is treated with UV and transfectedinto XP cell lines from patients with cloned XP genes(XPA–XPG, control plasmid). After repair and expressionof pRSVcat for 2 days, CAT activity is measured andDNA repair capacity (DRC) calculated as the percentageof the residual CAT gene expression after repair of dam-aged DNA compared to undamaged DNA, which is con-sidered as 100% (Fig. 3). The recovery of CAT activitydecreased with increased UV doses in all of the cell lines.

Xeroderma pigmentosumThis assay reﬂects the ability of the cells to repair thedamaged plasmid DNA by assessing the recovery of tran-scriptional activity of the plasmid. Carreau et al. (24) re-ported the usefulness of the HCR assay by use of clonedXP or Cockayne syndrome (CS) genes put into patients’cells using the calcium phosphate procedure for the diag-nosis of XP and CS. Kahn et al. (25) transfected thecloned XPC gene into the cells of a possible XPC patientto make a deﬁnite diagnosis of XPC using lipofectamine.This procedure increased the sensitivity of the assay withless DNA than the method by Carreau et al. (24). Fig.4 demonstrates the successful diagnosis by this assay inJapanese patients with XP (XP5HM, XP15HM). Only theXPA or XPF gene is capable of increasing DRC inXP5HM or XP15HM cells, respectively. A controlplasmid without any XP gene into any XP cell lines doesnot alter the post-UV DRC. Other reporter genes, e.g.expressing luciferase or b-galactosidase, are also utilized
as a non-RI tool for HCR. Complementation is assignedby determining which XP vector resulted in an extremelyenhanced post-UV CAT expression completely or par-tially to the levels of normal cells. Thus the measurementof post-UV HCR in patients’ cells using cloned XP genespermits the deﬁnite diagnosis of XP rapidly and easilywithout performing a somatic cell fusion study. This sensi-tive assay is easy and reproducible without using XP cellsof each group.T o date, genes responsible for XP A through G and XPvariant have been isolated and expression vectors contain-ing most of these genes are available for this assay.

Japanese XP patients, we began to use a host-cell reacti-vation (HCR) of a UV -treated plasmid with cloned XPgenes. The plasmid HCR assay presented here is usefulfor assessing the DRC of the cells and for the rapid andeasy diagnosis of XP . In our previous study, there was anapproximately 10% decline in the post-UV DRC afterpassage number 13 with in vitro aging (26). For the diag-nosis of XP using this system, the post-UV DRC wasmeasured only with fresh primary ﬁbroblasts (passagenumber less than 13). Alternatively, fresh T lymphocytescan be used immediately after being drawn from patientswith possible XP .CS, TTD, XP/CS complex and UV sensitivesyndromeCS is an autosomal recessive rare disease with features of
sun sensitivity, short stature, retinal pigmentary degenera-tion, calciﬁcation of the brain stem and progressive neuro-logical degeneration. Unlike XP , CS is not associated withskin cancer. Cells from CS patients are hypersensitive tokilling by UV , have decreased post-UV RNA synthesisand normal level of post-UV UDS (4).

Moriwaki & Kraemergroups (Fig. 1). Cells from TTD patients without sun sen-sitivity have normal UV survival and normal UDS.XP/CS complex is a clinical combination of two raregenetic disorders in one individual proposed by Jay Rob-bins (27). Patients show neurological abnormalities of CS,including short stature, mental retardation, deafness andretinal degeneration, and the skin abnormalities of XP ,including multiple freckles and skin cancer. Patients withthe XP/CS complex are found in three different XP com-plementation groups (XPB, XPD or XPG) (Fig. 1) (28).The cells from this complex have a low UV survival anda low level of DRC measured by UDS, plasmid HCR andshuttle vector plasmids. The XP/CS cells are phenotypic-ally more like XP cells than CS cells, though clinically theCS phenotype is more prominent than XP (Table 3) (28).UV -sensitive syndrome (UVS) has recently been de-
scribed as a new entity of genetic human disease affectingthe DNA repair of UV -induced DNA damages. The clin-ical manifestations resemble those of mild XP , while cellu-lar responses of UVS cells are indistinguishable fromthose of CS (29, 30). Cells from UVS patients show aslightly reduced UV survival, normal UDS and delayedrecovery of post-UV RNA synthesis. So far, a humangene responsible for UVS has not yet been identiﬁed. UVScells are defective in preferential repair of CPD in the tran-scribed strand of expressing genes like CSB cells.Carriers of XPHeterozygotes of rare autosomal recessive diseases arecommon and in XP the frequency of carriers has beenestimated by Swift et al. (31) to be °1 in 300. Accordingto the Dahlberg equation, the frequency of the XP genein Japan is approximately 1/300–400, estimating the fre-quency of ﬁrst cousin marriages in the general populationto be an average of 2% (32).Clinically, the parents of XP patients (the obligate het-
erozygotes) do not have any cutaneous or neurologicalsymptoms or acute sun sensitivity. Cells from these XPAcarriers have no DNA repair abnormality after UV ir-radiation, measured by colony formation or UDS (33).There are several observations of an increased frequencyof chromosomal abnormalities after UV irradiation andhigh frequency of spontaneous chromosome aberrationsin XP carriers (34, 35). Most clinical and laboratory in-vestigations based on their DNA repair abnormality havefailed to show clinical and biological differences betweenXP carriers and normal subjects. In transgenic mice, het-erozygous for XPA and heterozygous for XPC, a higherfrequency of tumors of the skin and internal organs, re-spectively, has been reported (36, 37). However, there isno direct evidence that human carriers of XP genes havea higher risk of skin cancer than normal subjects.52Care and treatment of XP
52Care and treatment of XPAs there is no cure for the genetic disorder XP , the maingoal of treatment involves the prompt and complete re-moval of skin cancers by skin surgeons. In addition to thesurgical resection of skin tumors, local injection of skinneoplasms with interferon amay be useful for melanomain situ (38). Another option to be tried is the use of iso-tretinoin, a vitamin A derivative, which has been shownto prevent the appearance of new skin neoplasms in XPpatients during oral medication of the drug (39).The topical use of T4 endonuclese V , a prokaryoticDNA repair enzyme which initiates repair of UV -inducedCPD in DNA, may be a useful tool to p revent the newappearance of actinic keratosis or other skin tumors inXP patients (40, 41).XP patients often have problems with their eyes such as
conjunctivitis, corneal clouding and neoplasms at a muchyounger age than in the general population. T o avoid theseocular symptoms, patients should use sunglasses thatblock UV light.In patients with XPA, B, D or G, progressive neurologi-
In patients with XPA, B, D or G, progressive neurologi-cal symptoms may be difﬁcult to manage. Hearing aidscan be helpful. Cases with XP neurodegenerative disordermay have problems with their teeth such as dental cariesand muscle atrophy, resulting in talipes equinus. Patientsshould be evaluated periodically for the rehabilitation ofmuscles of the whole body and by ophthalmologists,orthopedics and dentists as well as dermatologists.Recently, an experimental gene therapy for XP cells orXP mice has been investigated (42). When liposomalDNA containing an XPA complementing gene is appliedto XPA mice skin, the level of UDS after UV exposure isrestored and the DNA damage is repaired to almost nor-mal measured by monoclonal antibodies to TT dimmersand 6–4 photoproducts (personal communication). Thismethod, currently at research level, offers hope for thefuture.References1. Kraemer KH, Lee MM, Scotto J. Xeroderma pigmentosum. Cu-
