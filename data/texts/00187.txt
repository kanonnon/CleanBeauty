T elomere length, stem cells and agingMaria A BlascoTelomere shortening occurs concomitant with organismal aging, and it is accelerated in the context of human diseases associated with mutations in telomerase, such as some cases of dyskeratosis congenita, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and aplastic anemia. People with these diseases, as well as Terc-deficient mice, show decreased lifespan coincidental with a premature loss of tissue renewal, which suggests that telomerase is rate-limiting for tissue homeostasis and organismal survival. These findings have gained special relevance as they suggest that telomerase activity and telomere length can directly affect the ability of stem cells to regenerate tissues. If this is true, stem cell dysfunction provoked by telomere shortening may be one of the mechanisms responsible for organismal aging in both humans and mice. Here, we will review the current evidence linking telomere shortening to aging and stem cell dysfunction.
stem cell dysfunction.T elomeres are specialized chromatin structures at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that prevent the chromosome ends from being recognized as a DNA break1. In vertebrates, telomeres are composed of TTAGGG repeats bound by a protein complex called shelterin (also known as the telosome)2,3. Shelterin components have roles in chromosome protection and in the regulation of telomere length2,3.T elomere repeats are generated by a cellular reverse transcriptase known as telomerase (telomerase reverse transcriptase, or T ert)1. T elomerase rec -ognizes the 3 ′-OH at the ends of chromosomes and adds telomere repeats de novo  by using an associated RNA molecule as a template (telomerase RNA component, or T erc)1. Whereas unicellular eukaryotes have unlim -ited amounts of telomerase and maintain telomeres at a constant length, most multicellular eukaryotes have limited amounts of telomerase, and
telomere shortening occurs coupled to cell division owing to the incapac -ity of normal DNA polymerases to copy the very ends of chromosomes4. T elomere shortening can be further accelerated by the action of nucle -ases or certain DNA damaging agents. Interestingly, telomere attrition is observed with increasing age in all human tissues in which it has been tested5; this reflects the accumulated cell divisions associated with tis -sue renewal. Indeed, telomere shortening is one of the best-understood mechanisms known to impose a limit on the growth of normal cells in culture, a phenomenon also known as “replicative senescence”6.A number of age-related pathologies and premature aging syndromes are characterized by a faster-than-normal rate of telomere shortening, which suggests that telomere shortening may be a cause of organismal aging. A demonstration for this came from the study of the Terc-deficient mouse model. Terc-deficient mice show accelerated telomere shortening
and a shorter lifespan, which are further aggravated with increasing mouse generations until no more generations can be derived owing to male and female infertility7–9. However, the pathways by which short telomeres pro -voke aging are still far from being understood. On one hand, telomere shortening may promote aging by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in vivo , thus leading to cell loss and tissue dysfunction. On the other hand, telomere shortening may also impair the ability of stem cells to regenerate tissues, thus leading to tissue failure10. Here, we will review recent data suggesting the importance of telomere length in cancer and aging.The telomere structureVertebrate telomeres end in a 3 ′ overhang of the G-rich strand (G-strand overhang)11, which is generated by the postreplicative processing of the C-rich strand12, and that is the substrate for telomerase-mediated telomere elongation1 (Fig. 1a ). The G-strand overhang can fold back
and invade the double-stranded region of the telomere, thereby gener -
telomere elongation1 (Fig. 1a ). The G-strand overhang can fold back and invade the double-stranded region of the telomere, thereby gener -ating a looped structure known as the telomere loop or T-loop13, which hides the 3 ′ end from telomerase and from DNA repair and degrada -tion activities ( Fig. 1a ). T-loops may represent a primitive mechanism for telomere protection14. Furthermore, the fact that they resemble intermediates of homologous recombination suggests that they may be regulated by activities involved in this DNA repair pathway15.T elomere repeats are bound by the so-called shelterin multiprotein complex2 (Fig. 1a ). Shelterin contains factors that bind directly to the G-strand overhang, such as the protection of telomeres 1 (Pot1)-TTP1 heterodimer16,17, and to the double-stranded telomeric region, such as the telomere repeat binding factors TRF1 and TRF2 and their interacting proteins Rap1 (repressor activator protein 1) and Tin2
(TRF1-interacting nuclear protein 2)( Fig. 1a )2,3. TRF1 also recruits to telomeres the TANK1 and TANK2 poly(ADP)-ribosylases (also known as tankyrases)18. TRF1 and the TRF1-interacting proteins have been proposed to regulate telomere length by controlling the access of telom -erase to the telomere19. TRF2 and Pot1 are also important for telomere length regulation and have additional roles in telomere protection by preventing end-to-end chromosome fusions19–22. The role of TRF2 in telomere protection may be related to their interaction with DNA-damage signaling and repair factors23. In particular, TRF2 can interact with components of the Mre11 complex24, which is central to both nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination. More recently, TRF2 has been shown to interact with the nucleotide excision repair XPF-ERCC1 nuclease25, the Apollo nuclease26,27, and the DNA signaling factor MDC1 (ref. 28). Furthermore, TRF2 has been
proposed to bind to ATM and to cancel the ATM-triggered damage Telomeres and Telomerase Group, Molecular Oncology Program, Spanish National Cancer Centre, 3 Melchor Fernandez Almagro, 28019 Madrid, Spain.

response, which suggests that TRF2 has a role in preventing a DNA damage response at telomeres29,30. A similar role has been proposed for Pot1 based on the fact that Pot1-deficient mice show increased DNA damage signaling at telomeres22. Components of the NHEJ (Ku and DNA-PKcs) and homologous recombination (Rad51D, Rad54, XRCC3) pathways have also been shown to have roles in telomere length regula -tion and telomere capping12,15,31–33.In addition to the shelterin complex, both telomeres and subtelo -meres are bound by nucleosomes34,35 that are enriched in histone mod -ifications characteristic of constitutive heterochromatin domains36–38  (Fig. 1b ). These histone marks include trimethylation of H3K9 and H4K20 by the histone methyltransferases suppressor of variegation 3-9 homologs (Suv39h1 and h2) and suppressor of variegation 4-20 homologs (Suv4-20h1 and h2), respectively36–41. Furthermore, the heterochromatin proteins HP1 β, HP1 γ and HP1 α are also recruited
to telomeric and subtelomeric domains through their affinity for tri -methylated H3K9 residues36–38,42,43 (Fig. 1b ). These epigenetic marks are characteristic of compacted and transcriptionally silenced hetero -chromatin domains, such as those found at pericentric heterochro -matin39–41,43. In addition, telomeric and subtelomeric regions show low abundance of acetylated H3 (AcH3) and H4 (AcH4)42 and hyper -methylation of subtelomeric DNA37,44, which further supports that telomeres are silenced chromatin domains. The formation and main -tenance of these silenced heterochromatin domains at telomeres has been proposed to act as a negative regulator of telomere elongation ( Fig. 1b). In particular, disruption of either histone trimethylation36,38 or DNA methylation37 results in abnormally elongated telomeres as well as increased recombination between telomeric sequences ( Fig. 1b ).3´G-strand overhangTelomeresSubtelomeresTRF1TRF2Pot1TPP1Rap1TertTercDkc1TTAGGG TTAGGG

Telomere elongation mechanismsThe main mechanism for telomere elongation in mammals is the enzyme telomerase1 (Fig. 2a ). A recent study with highly purified telomerase extracts has demonstrated that the telomerase enzyme contains two molecules each of the telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit (T ert) and the telomerase-associated RNA molecule (T erc), as well as one mol -ecule of dyskerin45, a protein known to stabilize the telomerase complex5 (Fig. 2a ). The attrition of telomeric DNA that takes place during aging is likely to result from limiting amounts of telomerase activity in the adult organism, which cannot compensate for the progressive telomere short -ening that occurs as cells divide during tissue regeneration4,5,23. This progressive telomere loss has been proposed to contribute to organismal aging. In turn, the vast majority of tumors and immortal cell lines have high levels of telomerase, which is thought to sustain their immortal
growth by preventing telomere shortening and bypassing senescence and apoptosis23.Interestingly, some immortal cell lines and tumors that lack telomer -ase activity are still able to maintain or elongate their telomeres through activation of mechanisms known as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)46,47. In yeast and mammals, ALT has been shown to involve homologous recombination events between telomeric sequences46–48 (Fig. 2b ). AL T-positive cells are characterized by heterogeneous telomere lengths, with both very short and very long telomeres being present at the same time, and by the colocalization of telomeres with a specific type of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) body—so-called AL T-associated PML bodies (APBs)46–48 (Fig. 2b ). ALT mechanisms are also activated in Terc-deficient mice in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells49–51, and in vivo  during germinal center forma -
tion52, which indicates that ALT mechanisms can also be selected in nontumoral settings. However, while ALT can rescue the viability of telomerase-deficient yeast strains48, AL T mechanisms cannot rescue the viability of Terc-deficient mice, which suggests that AL T mechanisms do not operate to rescue survival of most multicellular organisms.The fact that ALT is mostly restricted to Terc-deficient mice, as well as immortal cell lines and tumors, indicates the existence of mecha -nisms that actively repress ALT in normal cells. Recent data indicates that components of shelterin complex such as Pot1 and TRF2, or TRF2-  interacting proteins such as WRN, can influence telomere recombina -tion53–55 and are potential regulators of ALT. Similarly, subtelomeric DNA methylation37,42 and histone methylation at telomeres42,56 are potent repressors of telomere recombination and ALT activation. However, a causal relationship between ALT activation in tumors and
defects in these telomere length regulators is still pending.Mouse modelsThe telomerase-deficient mouse model.  The Terc-deficient mouse model has been instrumental for studying the impact of short telomeres in cancer and aging and is currently considered one of the best models for studying telomere-driven aging. Terc-deficient mice were first gener -ated by elimination of the mouse Terc gene7,57. The long-term viability of the Terc−/− mouse strain is severely compromised, and only a limited number of generations can be derived owing to infertility and the pro -gressive development of pathologies associated with loss of telomeric repeats7,8,23,52,58–61 (T able 1  and Fig. 3 ). These pathologies include male and female infertility, heart failure, and immunosenescence, as well as decreased regeneration of the digestive system, the skin, and the hema -topoietic system, among others7,8,23,52,58–61 (T able 1 ). Dysfunctional
telomeres in Terc-deficient mice are detected as damaged DNA, thereby triggering cell cycle arrest or apoptosis at the cellular level60–64 (Fig. 3 ).
telomeres in Terc-deficient mice are detected as damaged DNA, thereby triggering cell cycle arrest or apoptosis at the cellular level60–64 (Fig. 3 ).Of notice, the pathologies developed by telomerase-null mice reca -pitulate human diseases associated with aging that are also characterized by defective proliferation and short telomeres ( T able 2 ). By contrast, those age-associated human diseases that are characterized by increased proliferation, such as cancer or atherosclerosis, are not reproduced in the Terc-deficient mouse model62,65, which suggests that development of these diseases requires further alterations to bypass the barrier that short telomeres impose on proliferation66. In this regard, the Terc-defi -cient mouse model has also been instrumental in dissecting the role of telomeres and telomerase in tumorigenesis ( T able 1 ). In particular, Terc-deficient mice with short telomeres are resistant to both induced
and spontaneous tumorigenesis62. Furthermore, mice that are simul -taneously deficient in telomerase and the tumor suppressor proteins p19ARF, p16, p21, APC, ATM, DNA-PKcs, Ku, PARP1 and PMS2 also show reduced tumorigenesis67–73 (T able 1 ). This indicates that short telomeres are potent suppressors of cancer even in tumor-prone genetic backgrounds, most likely because telomere dysfunction induces cellular arrest and apoptosis66–73 (Fig. 3 ). As an exception to this, telomerase deficiency and short telomeres in the context of p53 mutant mice and in the context of TRF2 overexpression lead to a further increase of epi -thelial tumors characterized by high levels of chromosomal instability, which suggests that mutation of these pathways helps bypass the barrier that short telomeres impose on tumor development53,74,75 (Fig. 3 ).Figure 2  Telomere elongation mechanisms.  (a) Telomerase is the main mechanism for telomere length elongation. The telomerase enzyme consists
of two molecules of the Tert subunit and two molecules of the associated Terc, which contains the template for the addition of new telomeric repeats. In addition, telomerase contains one molecule of dyskerin, a protein that stabilizes the telomerase complex. Telomerase recognizes the 3 ′ end of the G-rich telomere strand and adds telomeric repeats de novo . (b) Telomerase-deficient cells can also maintain telomeres by means of homologous recombination between telomeres, a mechanism known as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT).Uncapped telomereTertTercDkc1AAUCCCRecombination-based AL TIncreased telomere recombination Colocalization of telomeres and PML (APBs)  Heterogeneous telomere lengthsAATCCCTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGab642 VOLUME 3   NUMBER 10   OCTOBER  2007    NATURE CHEMICAL BIOLOGYR E V I E W
Interestingly, whereas p53 deficiency rescues degenerative pathologies in Terc-deficient mice at the expense of increased tumorigenesis74,75 (Fig. 3  and T able 1 ), p21 abrogation significantly rescues degenera -tive pathologies and survival of Terc-deficient mice without increasing tumorigenesis69 (Fig. 3  and T able 1 ). These different outcomes of p53 and p21 abrogation may be explained by the fact that p21 deficiency rescues proliferative defects but not apoptosis in Terc-deficient mice. These results highlight p21 as an important mediator of cell cycle arrest associated with short telomeres. Furthermore, they suggest that cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis is the main mechanism underlying telo -mere-driven aging ( Fig. 3 ). In turn, the fact that tumorigenesis is not increased in the context of simultaneous p21 and telomerase deficiencies in spite of increased proliferation pinpoints apoptosis as a major anti -
tumoral barrier in response to short telomeres ( Fig. 3 ). More recently, a similar role has been described for the mismatch repair protein PMS2, which seems to act in the same pathway as p21 in mediating cell arrest and aging provoked by short telomeres70 (Fig. 3  and T able 1 ).Mice with altered expression of the shelterin proteins.  A putative role for mammalian shelterin components in disease is suggested by the fact that TRF1, TRF2 and Tin2 are upregulated in some human carci -nomas76–80. Upregulation of these proteins may have an active role in promoting cancer, especially considering that shelterin components have important roles in regulating telomere length and telomere protection. In particular, TRF2 has been involved in telomere-length regulation19 and in preventing end-to-end chromosome fusions20,21. Interestingly, mice with increased TRF2 expression in stratified epithelia show dra -matically short telomeres and a premature deterioration of the skin, as

well as increased UV-induced skin carcinogenesis, which recapitu -lates the skin pathologies associated with the human tumor-prone xeroderma pigmentosum syndrome78 (Table 1 ). Overexpression of telomerase is not able to prevent telomere shortening or the aging pathologies in these mice78 (Table 1 ), which suggests that short telo -meres generated by TRF2 overexpression are not susceptible to rescue by telomerase78. Short telomeres in TRF2-overexpressing mice are rescued, however, in the absence of the TRF2-interacting XPF nucle -ase25,81 (T able 1 ). A current model suggests that TRF2 overexpression sequesters most XPF-ERCC1 at telomeres, which results in rapid telomere degradation and induction of skin aging phenotypes; at the same time depletion of XPF-ERCC1 from the rest of the chromatin results in defective nucleotide excision repair (NER), which leads to increased UV-induced DNA damage and skin cancer78. Interestingly,
the fact that the xeroderma pigmentosum skin phenotypes shown by TRF2 transgenic mice are not observed in mice deficient for differ -ent NER components suggest that human xeroderma pigmentosum pathologies are likely the result of a combination of NER deficiency and the presence of critically short telomeres.Finally, the increased epithelial carcinogenesis shown by TRF2-overexpressing mice is aggravated in the absence of telomerase activity, coincidental with increased chromosomal instability and telomere recombination53,78, which suggests that increased TRF2 expression is actively contributing to tumor development by helping to bypass the cell proliferation barrier imposed by short telomeres by means of inducing ALT pathways, therefore promoting the growth of tumors with a high chromosomal instability ( Fig. 3  and Table 1 ).Loss-of-function mouse models to study the effects of TRF2 abro -gation in the adult organism have been also generated21. TRF2 abro -
gation results in embryonic lethality21. however, cells derived from TRF2−/− Trp53−/− embryos show a dramatic loss of telomere protec -tion and a massive increase in end-to-end chromosome fusions21 (Table 1 ). Strikingly, TRF2 conditional deletion in adult hepato -cytes has no effect on viability or on liver regeneration capacity82, which suggests tissue specificity in the requirements for TRF2 func -tion. Further studies knocking out TRF2 in additional cell types are required to understand the impact of TRF2 deficiency in organismal and cellular viability. Similarly, the potential effects of TRF2 abroga -tion on tumorigenesis still need to be determined.A role for the TRF1 shelterin component in human disease is unknown other than the fact that this protein is upregulated in some human tumors76,77,79,80. Mice deficient in TRF1 show embryonic lethality in the absence of defective telomere length or loss of telo -
mere protection83 (Table 1 ). Interestingly, a role for TRF1 in mitosis has also been suggested84 that may explain mouse lethality. Similarly, mice deficient in TIN2 show embryonic lethality independently of telomere length maintenance and telomerase activity85 (Table 1 ). TIN2 colocalizes to nontelomeric heterochromatin domains through its interaction with HP1 γ (ref. 86), which suggests a putative role for this protein in heterochromatin assembly.Finally, a role for the Pot1 shelterin component in human dis -ease is suggested by recent findings showing that deletion of the genes encoding Pot1 in mice results in chromosomal instability and increased telomere recombination, which in turn may have an impact on carcinogenesis22,54 (Table 1 ). However, the specific involvement of Pot1 in human disease remains to be demonstrated.Figure 3  The telomerase knockout mouse as a model for telomere-induced aging. Telomere shortening in the context of Terc-deficient mice leads to
premature loss of mouse viability and decreased lifespan associated with
aging. Telomere shortening in the context of Terc-deficient mice leads to premature loss of mouse viability and decreased lifespan associated with a number of degenerative pathologies. These pathologies can be rescued in the absence of p53, p21 or PMS2, which indicates that these proteins are important mediators of telomere-induced aging. Importantly, the fact that both p21 and PMS2 abrogation only rescue proliferative defects but not apoptosis triggered by short telomeres indicates that cell arrest rather than apoptosis is responsible for telomere-driven aging. In turn, short telomeres impose a barrier on tumor development that can only be bypassed by abrogation of p53 or by TRF2 overexpression, which indicates that these molecular events are important in mediating cancer driven by short telomeres and chromosomal instability.p53p21PMS2Cancerp53TRF2AgingDecreased life  spanDecreased cancerCell arrest and apoptosisCell arrest and apoptosisTelomere

Telomere shortening in aging pathologiesOne of the best-known cell-intrinsic events associated with aging is the progressive shortening of telomeres ( Fig. 4 ). The speed at which telomeres shorten with aging seems to vary between men and women and can be influenced by factors considered to accelerate aging and to be a risk of premature death, such as socioeconomic status, perceived stress, smoking, and obesity, all of which have been proposed to nega -tively affect telomere length87–90 (T able 2 ). T elomere shortening is also accelerated in various human diseases associated with aging, such as cardiovascular disease and infections, among others91–95. Indeed, a cor -relation between telomere length and risk of death from heart disease or infections has been reported96. Similarly, telomere length has been proposed to be predictive of dementia and cognitive impairment89,97.In addition, several human syndromes are characterized by muta -
tions in the telomerase genes, which result in accelerated rates of telomere shortening with age ( T able 2 ). These include some cases of dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic anemia and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In particular, people with dyskeratosis congenita carry muta -tions in components of the telomerase complex that result in decreased telomerase stability and shorter telomeres98. These mutations affect either the TERC  and TERT  genes (people with the autosomal domi -nant dyskeratosis congenita variant)99,100 or the dyskeratosis congenita 1 gene ( DKC1 ; people with the X-linked form of the disease), which encodes a telomerase-interacting protein involved in T erc stability and small nucleolar RNA processing98. Both mutations result in decreased telomerase activity and shorter telomeres compared with healthy indi -viduals98–100. Strikingly, people with dyskeratosis congenita develop many of the pathologies shown for the Terc-deficient mouse model,
such as short stature, hypogonadism and infertility, defects of the skin and the hematopoietic system, bone marrow failure, and premature death. Furthermore, like Terc-deficient mice, individuals with dyskera -tosis congenita also show increased chromosomal instability with age, which is consistent with a faster rate of telomere loss. Finally, people with dyskeratosis congenita and Terc-deficient mice both show disease anticipation in affected progeny, which strongly suggests that short telomeres directly contribute to disease presentation9,100. Of notice, an important difference between people with dyskeratosis congenita and Terc-deficient mice is the fact that people with dyskeratosis con -genita show an elevated incidence of spontaneous cancer, whereas Terc- deficient mice have an increased resistance to cancer, except for those with p53-deficient and TRF2-overexpressing genetic backgrounds62,67–
75. Therefore, Terc-deficient mice recapitulate closely, but not completely, the human dyskeratosis congenita syndrome pathologies. A reason for this difference may be that, in contrast to T erc -null mice, people with dyskeratosis congenita still retain the telomerase genes, which can be upregulated during tumorigenesis.A number of people diagnosed with aplastic anemia also show mutations in the telomerase TERC  and TERT  genes, thus resulting in accelerated telomere shortening and premature death101,102 (T able 2). More recently, mutations in the telomerase components have also been found in some cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which is an adult-onset lethal disease characterized by lung scarring and subsequent  Young tissue Aged tissueSenescence?Apoptosis?+Oncogenic mutationsDecreased mobilizatio nof stem cellsIncreased mobilizationof stem cellsNiche of stem cells with nor mal telomeresNiche of stem cells with shor t telomeresNiche of stem cells with

Telomere shortening leads to a decreased ability of stem cells to leave the stem cell niche and to regenerate tissues. The mechanisms underlying the decreased mobilization of stem cells are still unknown but are likely to involve senescence and apoptosis in response to short telomeres. In turn, telomerase overexpression may lead to increased mobilization of the stem cells out of the niche. This aberrant mobilization of stem cells may contribute to cancer formation in combination with oncogenic mutations.NATURE CHEMICAL BIOLOGY   VOLUME 3   NUMBER 10   OCTOBER  2007  645R E V I E W
respiratory failure. This further expands the number of human diseases characterized by regeneration defects that are associated with telomerase defects103,104 (T able 2 ).In addition to individuals with dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic ane -mia or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, who have defective telomerase activity and short telomeres, a number of additional human premature aging syndromes are also characterized by an accelerated rate of telo -mere loss and chromosomal instability ( T able 2 ). Interestingly, these diseases are produced by mutations in DNA repair proteins such as Nbs1 (Nijmegen breakage syndrome), Mre11 (ataxia telangiectasia–like disor -der), WRN (Werner syndrome), BLM (Bloom syndrome), ATM (ataxia telangiectasia) and proteins encoded by FANC  genes (Fanconi anemia)  (T able 2 ), many of which interact with the TRF2 telomere-binding pro -tein23. The aging pathologies associated with the Werner, Bloom and
ATM human syndromes have been modeled in mice only when in com -bination with telomerase deficiency and short telomeres in the context of the Terc-deficient mouse model73,105–107 (T able 1 ), which suggests that short telomeres contribute to the pathobiology of these premature aging diseases in humans.Telomere shortening and stem cell dysfunctionCancer and aging, two biological processes in which telomerase activity has been implicated, are increasingly seen as stem cell diseases10,23,108. In particular, cancer may often originate from the transformation of nor -mal stem cells, and aging has been associated with a progressive decline in the number and/or functionality of certain stem cells10,108 (Fig. 4 ).Although telomerase is expressed at very high levels during embryonic development, its expression is downregulated a few weeks after birth in the majority of adult tissues, with the exception of adult stem cell
compartments and cells that undergo rapid expansion, such as lympho -cytes or skin keratinocytes10. The fact that telomerase activity is largely restricted to stem cells suggests that telomerase levels in these cells may be determinant for organism fitness. Evidence for a rate-limiting role of telomerase in human aging and lifespan has come from the study of human diseases associated with mutations in telomerase components. As discussed above, mutations in the telomerase core components T ert and T erc are present in people that suffer from aplastic anemia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and dyskeratosis congenita ( T able 2 ). These lethal diseases are adult-onset and are characterized by a premature loss of tis -sue regeneration associated with telomere shortening98–104. In an analo -gous manner, telomerase deficiency in mice results in decreased median and maximum lifespan already within the first mouse generation, also
indicating that telomerase is rate-limiting for aging in mice9.In the past few years, the specific role of telomerase in different stem cell compartments has started to be elucidated, mostly in well-characterized stem cell subtypes such as hematopoietic stem cells (HSC)109–112, epidermal stem cells (ESC)10,113 and neural stem cells (NSC)114. In particular, HSCs derived from humans and mice lose telomeric DNA with age despite the presence of detectable telomerase activity109–112. This progressive telomere shortening is proposed to act as a developmental barrier for HSCs, which may limit hematopoietic regeneration. In support of this notion, HSCs from Terc-deficient mice with short telomeres show a reduced ability to repopulate irradiated mice61,111,112.The use of loss-of-function and gain-of-function mouse models for telomerase has also served to establish the role of telomere length and telomerase activity on ESC behavior10,113,115. T elomere shortening in
the context of Terc-deficient mice has been shown to result in decreased functionality of their skin ESC compartment113. In particular, mobiliza -
the context of Terc-deficient mice has been shown to result in decreased functionality of their skin ESC compartment113. In particular, mobiliza -tion (proliferation and migration) of ESCs out of the hair follicle niche upon mitogen-induced proliferation is inhibited in Terc−/− mice with critically short telomeres113 (Fig. 4 ). This mobilization defect results in lower rates of proliferation in the hair follicle stem cell niche and in the adjacent transient-amplifying compartments, leading to defective hair growth and a stunted hyperplasic response113.Interestingly, transgenic mice with constitutive T ert overexpression in the epidermis including the ESC compartment (K5- Tert mice) pres -ent an increased ESC mobilization upon treatment with proliferation stimuli113 (Fig. 4  and T able 1 ). This increased ESC mobilization is concomitant with increased keratinocyte proliferation, enhanced hair growth, and augmented skin hyperplasia113. Similar results regarding
ESC activation and hair growth have been reported using a different transgenic mouse in which T ert is overexpressed in a conditional man -ner115 (T able 1 ). In the latter  study, the hair growth-promoting effects of T ert were found to be independent of the telomerase RNA component and therefore of telomerase activity, which suggests a noncanonical role for T ert other than its known role in telomere synthesis. However, the potential involvement of T ert independently of T erc in other in vivo  proliferative responses is still unclear, as it has been recently shown that absence of Terc abrogates the enhanced skin tumorigenesis and wound healing responses shown by transgenic mice that constitutively overexpress T ert in the skin116. These different requirements for T erc in epidermal growth versus hair growth may be explained by the existence of distinct cell populations involved in these processes117,118.
Besides the skin, other tissues with a high cell turnover such as bone marrow, intestine and testis show atrophies in Terc-deficient mice with critically short telomeres8,58 (T able 1 ), which supports the notion that telomere length is a determinant for tissue fitness in the wide context of the organism.Finally, it is important to note that the effects of telomere length and telomerase activity on different stem cell compartments (ESC, HSC and adult NSC) are cell autonomous, as demonstrated using in vitro  clonogenicity assays61,113. In addition, it has been recently shown that short telomeres in the context of the Terc-deficient mouse model may also limit the ability of stem cell microenvironments or estroma to sustain the proper functioning of transplanted wild-type stem cells119. All together, these results suggest that telomere shortening with aging is not only an intrinsic factor leading to aberrant stem cell functioning
but also may affect the viability of the stem cell environment, thereby further aggravating stem cell dysfunction with aging. This is relevant for designing potential therapeutic strategies based on telomerase reac -Figure 5  Antagonistic effects of telomerase in cancer and aging.

tivation because it indicates that the effects of telomerase and telomere length on stem cell behavior are dependent on both the stem cells and the physiological niche microenvironments.Telomerase-based therapeutic approachesThe establishment of the role of telomeres and telomerase in human disease has been important for the design of appropriate therapeutic strategies. The fact that diseases associated with human aging and pre -mature aging syndromes are characterized by short telomeres, together with observations from the Terc-knockout mouse model demonstrating that short telomeres contribute to these different pathologies, suggests therapeutic potential for strategies based on temporary telomerase re-activation. Therapeutic agents that could be designed to do this would preferentially target those cell types that normally divide to maintain organ homeostasis—such as stem cells, which, although telomerase-
proficient, do not have sufficient telomerase activity to maintain telo -mere length over time. Germ-line reintroduction of telomerase extends inherited short telomeres in mouse models and prevents the occurrence of end-to-end fusions and pathologies associated with short telomeres, such as bone marrow aplasia, atrophy of the intestinal epithelium, hypo -gonadism and infertility120. Similarly, telomerase reactivation could pre -vent critical telomere shortening and associated pathologies in those premature aging syndromes that are characterized by a faster rate of telomere loss, as well as in age-associated diseases.By contrast, the fact that the vast majority of human tumors seem to depend on telomerase reactivation to prevent critical telomere loss and to divide indefinitely suggests that telomerase inhibition could be an effective way to abolish tumor growth66. An increasing number of therapeutic strategies based on targeting telomerase in cancer have been
developed during the last few years, which include pharmacological inhibitors of the enzyme, as well as immunotherapy strategies66. Many of these strategies are based on triggering critical shortening of telomeres and loss of cell viability. Interestingly, short telomeres in the context of telomerase deficiency are likely to act synergistically with anticancer therapies based on genotoxic agents, given that telomere dysfunction results in hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents66.The fact that telomerase deficiency only results in loss of organismal viability when telomeres reach a critically short length is an important point when considering possible secondary effects of these therapies. In particular, this predicts that putative anticancer therapies based on temporary telomerase inhibition will only trigger loss of viability in those cells with short telomeres that depend on telomerase activity. Presumably, these include tumor cells but not healthy tissues, which
generally lack telomerase activity and have sufficiently long telomeres to maintain viability during the human lifetime, thus providing a window of opportunity for intervention.Additional research is needed to establish the role of telomeres and telomerase in the biology of stem cells and of cancer stem cells, which is likely to significantly contribute to the success of therapeutic approaches against cancer and aging. In this regard, generation of new mouse mod -els targeting telomeres and telomerase in adult stem cell compartments is essential to validate telomerase as a good target for stem cell–based therapeutic strategies.Finally, although there is strong evidence supporting a role for short telomeres in limiting the lifespan of humans and mice, demonstration of whether telomerase re-expression in adult tissues is able to bypass the proliferation barrier imposed by short telomeres and extend the lifespan
of organisms is still pending. In this regard, it has been previously dem -
proliferation barrier imposed by short telomeres and extend the lifespan of organisms is still pending. In this regard, it has been previously dem -onstrated that T ert overexpression in normal mortal cells is sufficient to immortalize them—which is why T ert has been called the “immor -tality enzyme”121. Overexpression of T ert in transgenic mouse models, however, has been shown to result in increased tumorigenesis122–125 (T able 1  and Fig. 5 ). Nevertheless, those T ert transgenic mice that do not die of tumors seemed to have an extension of the maximum lifespan, which suggests beneficial effects of T ert overexpression on organismal aging124. Future studies warrant demonstration of whether telomerase is a longevity gene.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSM.A. Blasco’s laboratory is funded by the MCyT (SAF2005-00277, GEN2001 4856-C13-08), the Regional Government of Madrid (GR/SAL/0597/2004), the European Union (TELOSENS FIGH-CT-2002-00217, INTACT LSHC-CT-2003 506803,
