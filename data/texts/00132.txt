Averageness, symmetry, and sexual di-morphism are good candidates for biologically based standards of beauty.

Attractive faces activatereward centers in the brain (Aharon et al. 2001, O’Doherty et al. 2003), theymotivate sexual behavior and the development of same-sex alliances (Berscheid&Reis 1998, Berscheid & Walster 1974, Feingold 1990, Rhodes et al. 2005c,
Thornhill & Gangestad 1999), and they elicit positive personality attributions (the“what is beautiful is good” stereotype—Dion et al. 1972, Eagly et al. 1991, Langloiset al. 2000) and positive treatment in a variety of settings (Hosoda et al. 2003,Langlois et al. 2000). It is not surprising, therefore, that philosophers, scientists,and ordinary people have long puzzled over what makes a face attractive and whywe have the preferences we do (Etcoff 1999).Along-held view in the social sciences is that standards of beauty are arbi-
trary cultural conventions (Berry 2000, Etcoff 1999). Even Darwin favored thisview after observing large cultural differences in beautiﬁcation practices (Darwin1998/1874). However, two observations suggest that some preferences may bepart of our biological, rather than our cultural, heritage. First, people in differentcultures generally agree on which faces are attractive (Cunningham et al. 1995;Langlois et al. 2000; Perrett et al. 1994, 1998; Rhodes et al. 2001b, 2002; butsee Jones & Hill 1993 for weaker agreement). Second, preferences emerge earlyin development, before cultural standards of beauty are likely to be assimilated(Geldart et al. 1999; Langlois et al. 1987, 1991; Rubenstein et al. 1999, 2002;Samuels et al. 1994; Samuels & Ewy 1985; Slater et al. 1998, 2000).Because preferences affect mate choice (e.g., Rhodes et al. 2005c), they may
have evolved through sexual selection, whereby traits (including preferences) en-hance reproductive success. Three candidates have been proposed for sexuallyselected preferences. The ﬁrst is a preference for averageness, i.e., proximity toaspatially average face for a population. The second is a preference for bilateralsymmetry. The third is a preference for sexual dimorphism, i.e., for feminine traitsin female faces and masculine traits in male faces.These traits have been proposed to signal mate quality so that preferences forthem may be adaptations for ﬁnding good mates (Gangestad & Thornhill 1997;Penton-V oak & Perrett 2000a; Rhodes & Zebrowitz 2002; Thornhill & Gangestad1993, 1999; Symons 1979). However, it is also possible that these preferences areby-products of the way brains process information, with no link between preferredtraits and mate quality (e.g., Enquist & Arak 1994, Jansson et al. 2002, Johnstone1994).
The ﬁrst aim of this review is to assess the appeal of the three candidates for bi-ologically based preferences: for averageness, symmetry, and sexual dimorphism.
25 Oct 2005 15:50 AR ANRV264-PS57-08.tex XMLPublishSM(2004/02/24) P1: OKZFACIAL BEAUTY 201The second aim is to understand what evolutionary mechanisms may have shapedthese preferences and to try to resolve the debate about whether or not attractivetraits signal mate quality.WHAT MAKES A FACE ATTRACTIVE?In his excellent book on beauty, Armstrong (2004) argues that beauty cannot beexplained by a single principle, such as Hogarth’s serpentine line, mathematicallyharmonious proportions, or a match of form to function. Similarly, there is nogold standard for facial beauty. Components of attractiveness may include aver-ageness, symmetry, sexual dimorphism, a pleasant expression, good grooming,youthfulness (Berry 2000, Cunningham 1986, Etcoff 1999, Rhodes & Zebrowitz2002, Thornhill & Gangestad 1999), and, for known faces, can reﬂect nonphysicalcharacteristics, such as how much one likes the person (Knifﬁn & Wilson 2004).
There may also be different kinds of attractiveness (e.g., sexual attractiveness,
attractiveness as a potential ally, cuteness) with different affective and motivationalconsequences (e.g., sexual arousal, competitiveness, caregiving). However, moststudies have simply asked people to judge “attractiveness,” which assumes somecommon aesthetic/affective judgment for faces of both sexes. These judgmentsappear to reﬂect sexual attractiveness for opposite-sex faces, with responses cor-relating almost perfectly with ratings of desirability to date (0.97) or marry (0.93)(Cunningham et al. 1990). They may also elicit judgments of sexual attractive-ness (to the opposite sex) for same-sex faces, because men and women generallyagree on attractiveness (Langlois et al. 2000). This agreement could reﬂect theassessment of sexual attractiveness in same-sex faces, to assess their danger aspotential rivals for mates, or it could reﬂect some more generic aesthetic or affec-tive response that is made to all faces. Agreement about which faces are attractivenot only occurs between men
faces are attractivenot only occurs between men and women, but also between people from differentcultures (e.g., Langlois et al. 2000). Therefore, contrary to the popular maxim thatbeauty is in the eye of the beholder, preferences are not highly idiosyncratic andwe can sensibly ask, what makes a face attractive?
Here I focus on averageness, symmetry, and sexual dimorphism, the three can-didates for biologically based preferences. There is now a critical mass of studies,making a meta-analytic, as well as conceptual, review useful. Meta-analyses com-bine data across studies, giving estimates of the strength of the association (effectsize) between attractiveness and given traits. They will also allow us to examinewhether preferences generalize across sex and race of faces, and to assess formallythe effects of potentially important methodological variables.Separate meta-analyses were conducted for averageness, symmetry, and sexualdimorphism. The results are summarized in Table 1 (for details, see the Supplemen-tal Material link for Electronic Appendices 1–3 in the online version of this chap-ter at http://www.annualreviews.org/).

Effectssizes are interpreted following Cohen (1977), with 0.10, 0.30, and 0.50 consideredsmall, medium, and large, respectively.AveragenessAn average face has mathematically average trait values for a population (Figure 1).Faces that are high in averageness are low in distinctiveness. Averageness wouldbe a good candidate for a biologically based preference, if it signals mate quality.

Lines have been addedto illustrate how points capture the layout of internal features and the face outline, butonly the points are actually used. Averaged composites of Caucasian and Chinesefemale ( top)and male ( bottom )faces. Each composite is created from 24 faces.Several theorists have proposed that average traits reﬂect developmental stability,
i.e., the ability to withstand stress during development (e.g., Møller & Swaddle1997, Thornhill & Møller 1997) and heterozygosity, which may increase diseaseresistance (Gangestad & Buss 1993, Thornhill & Gangestad 1993). Average traitsmay also be functionally optimal (e.g., average nose optimal for breathing), whichshould improve condition (Koeslag 1990, Symons 1979). Therefore, averagenesscould signal aspects of mate quality, such as good condition and/or heritable re-sistance to disease. The proposed link between averageness and mate quality isexamined below. Here I consider whether average faces are indeed attractive.In an inﬂuential paper, Langlois and her colleagues (1990) demonstrated theappeal of computer-generated averaged composites of faces. These were generallymore attractive than the component faces, and as faces were added (up to about16), the composites became more attractive.These counterintuitive results were met with skepticism. Surely beauty is ex-
traordinary and cannot be explained by averageness, which is ordinary. Criticssuggested that perhaps the composites were not really average (Alley &Cunningham 1991, Benson & Perrett 1992, Pittenger 1991), and they were right.The composites had nonaverage features (large eyes and lips) because feature out-lines were not aligned prior to blending, and they had smooth complexions andasoft-focus look, which are attractive but not average (Benson & Perrett 1992,Little & Hancock 2002). However, composites remained attractive when features
25 Oct 2005 15:50 AR ANRV264-PS57-08.tex XMLPublishSM(2004/02/24) P1: OKZ204 RHODESwere aligned (O’Toole et al. 1999, Rhodes et al. 1999b, Rhodes & Tremewan1996) and when same (or no) complexion appeared on all the images (Little &Hancock 2002, O’Toole et al. 1999, Rhodes et al. 1999b, Rhodes & Tremewan1996). Therefore, the appeal of average composites is not due to enlarged featuresor smooth complexions.Critics also suggested that reduction of (randomly distributed) facial asymme-
tries by averaging might explain the appeal of composites (Alley & Cunningham1991). However, averageness remains attractive when the effects of symmetryare statistically controlled (Rhodes et al. 1999b) and when proﬁles are used, sothat symmetry is unaffected (Valentine et al. 2004). Nor is the appeal of averagedcomposites due to their youthful appearance or pleasant expressions. These areattractive traits (Cunningham et al. 1995, Zebrowitz et al. 1993), but average facesremain attractive when these effects are statistically controlled (O’Toole et al. 1999,Rhodes et al. 1999b). Finally, the appeal of average faces is unlikely to be an arti-fact of combining idiosyncratic preferences across participants, because inter-rateragreement on attractiveness is high (Langlois et al. 2000). Therefore, although com-posites can have some nonaverage features, these do not fully explain their appeal.Converging evidence for the appeal of average faces comes from studies using
normal, unmanipulated faces. Typical faces, which are closer to the populationaverage, are consistently rated as more attractive than distinctive faces (e.g., Lightet al. 1981; Morris & Wickham 2001; O’Toole et al. 1994; Rhodes & Tremewan1996; Rhodes et al. 1999b, 2005c; V okey & Read 1992). Furthermore, the attrac-tiveness of individual faces can be increased (or reduced) by moving their con-ﬁgurations toward (or away from) an average conﬁguration for that sex (O’Tooleet al. 1999, Rhodes et al. 1999b, Rhodes & Tremewan 1996).The meta-analysis showed a large effect of averageness on attractiveness(0.52 ±0.41, M ±SD; 95% CI =0.42–0.61, N=45) (Table 1). The effectsize was larger for manipulated images (0.67 ±0.43, N=18) than for real faces(0.40 ±0.33, N=27), t(43) =3.20, p<0.003, consistent with the idea that
some (nonaverage) features of composites may contribute to their appeal. However,the appeal of averageness was still moderate (0.40) for real faces. Examination ofthe funnel plot (see Supplemental Material link for Electronic Appendix 1 in theonline version of this chapter at http://www.annualreviews.org/) suggested littlepublication bias. Funnel plots show effect size as a function of sample size. Vari-ability is expected to decrease with increasing sample size, and effect sizes shouldbe distributed symmetrically around the large sample mean. An asymmetric dis-tribution indicates likely publication bias.Although most studies use ratings of averageness, a few have attempted tomeasure it. Effect sizes were smaller for measurements (0.09 ±0.36, N=5) thanfor ratings (0.47 ±0.28, N=22), t(25) =2.76, p<0.02. Current measurement
methods are poor, capturing only a limited part of a face’s structure and nothingof its fattiness or skin quality (see Rhodes et al. 2005c for discussion), and ratingsmay be the more valid measure. They covary with physical manipulations ofaverageness (e.g., Rhodes & Tremewan 1996) and draw on a perceptual system
25 Oct 2005 15:50 AR ANRV264-PS57-08.tex XMLPublishSM(2004/02/24) P1: OKZFACIAL BEAUTY 205that is highly sensitive to subtle facial variations. Whatever indices are used, theyshould be independent (e.g., rated by different participants) because effect sizes areinﬂated when they are not (0.73 ±0.42, N=8, nonindependent; 0.47 ±0.38,N=37, independent), t(43) =2.66, p<0.02. A medium effect size is obtainedwhen independent indices are used with real faces (0.37 ±0.33, 95% CI =0.24–0.49, N=23). This is the best estimate of the effect size.The appeal of averageness did not differ signiﬁcantly for male (0.57 ±0.56,N=12) and female (0.41 ±0.20, N=15) faces, t(25) =1.24, p=0.225. Moststudies have combined male and female ratings because men and women agreeon attractiveness (Langlois et al. 2000). However, effect sizes are lower for opposite-sex ratings (0.30 ±0.33, N=13) than when same-sex ratings are included(0.71±0.51, N=2, same-sex; 0.61 ±0.40, N=28, combined), F(2,40) =4.99,
p<0.02 (opposite versus combined differ on Scheff´ eS ,p<0.02). Therefore, itmay be wise to keep opposite-sex and same-sex ratings distinct in future studies.Most studies have used Western faces and participants. However, average facesmay also be attractive in non-Western cultures (to own-race raters) because therewasnosigniﬁcant effect of face-race, t(27) =0.03, p=0.98 (0.59 ±0.41,N=20, Western; 0.59 ±0.39, N=9, non-Western). These results are consistentwith a perceptual mechanism that favors average faces, although what is averagewill certainly vary between populations. Perceptual adaptation results suggest thatmental representations of what is average (for a given sex and race) are constantlyupdated by experience (Rhodes et al. 2003b).Clearly, average faces are attractive. However, there are some important caveats.These results don’t mean that allattractive faces are average (contra Langlois &Roggman 1990) or that average faces are optimally attractive (see below). Never-
theless, average facial conﬁgurations are more attractive than most faces, and thispreference must be explained.SymmetryOver the past decade, research on the attractiveness of facial symmetry has beenproliﬁc, motivated by the idea that symmetry advertises mate quality (e.g.,Gangestad & Thornhill 1997, Gangestad et al. 1994, Palmer & Strobeck 1986,Parsons 1990, Polak 2003, Thornhill & Gangestad 1999, Thornhill & Møller 1997,Watson & Thornhill 1994). Fluctuating asymmetries (FAs) are nondirectional (ran-
dom) deviations from perfect symmetry in bilaterally paired traits. In nonhumananimals, FA in body traits reﬂects developmental instability (inability to withstandstress during development), increasing with inbreeding, homozygosity, parasiteload, poor nutrition, and pollution (Møller & Swaddle 1997, Parsons 1990, Polak2003). In humans, body FA increases with inbreeding, premature birth, psychosis,and mental retardation (Livshits & Kobylianski 1991). If similar relationships existfor facial FA, then it could signal mate quality.Symmetric bodies are attractive to many animals, including humans (Brooks&Pomiankowski 1994, Concar 1995, Gangestad & Simpson 2000, Thornhill &
25 Oct 2005 15:50 AR ANRV264-PS57-08.tex XMLPublishSM(2004/02/24) P1: OKZ206 RHODESGangestad 1994, Watson & Thornhill 1994). But are symmetric faces attractive?Early studies suggested that they were not, with normal (slightly asymmetric)faces preferred to perfectly symmetric versions (Kowner 1996, Langlois et al.1994, Samuels et al. 1994, Swaddle & Cuthill 1995). However, more recent stud-ies found that perfectly symmetric faces were more attractive than the original,slightly asymmetric, faces (e.g., Perrett et al. 1999; Rhodes et al. 1998, 1999a,b) andthat their appeal could not be explained by any associated increase in averageness(Rhodes et al. 1999b) or change in skin texture (Perrett et al. 1999, Rhodes et al.1999a).The discrepancy seems to reﬂect differences in how the perfectly symmetricfaces were made (Rhodes et al. 1999b). In the early studies, symmetric faces were
made by reﬂecting each hemiface about the vertical midline to create two sym-metric chimeras (Kowner 1996, Samuels et al. 1994). However, these chimerastypically display structural abnormalities in aspect ratios and the sizes of midlinefeatures. For example, if the nose bends sideways, then the nose will be abnormallywide in one chimera and abnormally narrow in the other. Slight deviations fromfront-on views in the original photographs result in abnormally wide or narrowchimeras and abnormal eye spacing. Attractiveness decreases with deviations fromaverage facial conﬁgurations, so these abnormalities will offset any preference for
symmetry per se. When perfectly symmetric faces are made by blending normaland mirror-reversed images (Figure 2), they are more attractive than the original,slightly asymmetric faces (e.g., Perrett et al. 1999; Rhodes et al. 1998, 1999a,b).The only exception is a study by Swaddle & Cuthill (1995), but failure to controlexpression and remove blemishes before morphing could have contributed to fail-ure to ﬁnd a symmetry preference in this study. The meta-analysis conﬁrmed thatsymmetry is attractive when blends are used (0.43 ±0.32, N=16) but not whenchimeras are used ( −0.62±0.30, N=3), t(17) =5.71, p<0.0001.Converging evidence for the appeal of facial symmetry comes from studies with
normal faces. Natural variations in symmetry covary with attractiveness (Jones &Hill 1993, for some ethnic groups; Grammer & Thornhill 1994; Mealey et al.1999; Rikowski & Grammer 1999; Rhodes et al. 1998, 1999a,b; Scheib et al.1999; Zebrowitz et al. 1996). Symmetry remains attractive when the effects ofaverageness are statistically controlled, which suggests that the two contributeindependently to attractiveness (Rhodes et al. 1999b). The meta-analysis showedamedium effect size for normal faces (0.23 ±0.23, N=42). All but one ofthese studies used independent indices of symmetry and attractiveness. The funnelplot showed no evidence of publication bias for normal faces, but a possible bias(to publish large effects) for blends (see Supplemental Material link for ElectronicAppendix 2 in the online version of this chapter at http://www.annualreviews.org/).The meta-analysis revealed no signiﬁcant effects of sex of face, F(2,60) =1.79,
p=0.18 (0.17 ±0.36, N=26, female; 0.26 ±0.20, N=27, male; 0.40 ±0.50,N=10, combined); sex of rater, F(2,57) =0.40, p=0.67 (0.31 ±0.20, N=28,opposite-sex; 0.13 ±0.01, N=2, same-sex; 0.28 ±0.35, N=30, combined);or race of face, F(2,34) =2.28, p=0.12 (0.32 ±0.25, N=20, Western;

In all cases, theeffect sizes were small to medium.Although motivated by the idea that symmetry might signal mate quality, few
studies have isolated FA, which is the theoretically relevant construct. This isimportant because directional asymmetries (DAs), which are consistent across apopulation and do not signal mate quality, also occur in faces (Simmons et al.2004). Jones & Hill (1993) attempted to measure FA but measured only six traits.They also failed to demonstrate repeatability, which is important because FA isdistributed as measurement error and needs to be distinguished from it (Simmonset al. 2004). Other studies claim to measure FA, but do not. For example, asym-metry is often measured by summing the offsets (from a vertical midline) of themidpoints of a few bilaterally paired landmarks (see, e.g., Grammer & Thornhill1994). In a perfectly symmetric face, the sum would be zero. Although referred toas facial FA, this measure includes DA. Interestingly, symmetry ratings seem toreﬂect FA, but not DA, and may be a valid proxy for FA (Simmons et al. 2004).People apparently adapt to DA, which is consistent
apparently adapt to DA, which is consistent across a population, and noticedeviations from it. Ratings change systematically when facial symmetry is manip-ulated, conﬁrming their validity (see, e.g., Rhodes et al. 1999b), and are probablysensitive to more subtle facial asymmetries than are current measurement meth-ods. Therefore, on theoretical grounds, ratings may be preferable to measurements.
25 Oct 2005 15:50 AR ANRV264-PS57-08.tex XMLPublishSM(2004/02/24) P1: OKZ208 RHODESThe meta-analysis, however, showed no signiﬁcant effect of whether symmetry wasrated (0.30 ±0.24, N=14) or measured (0.19 ±0.22, N=28), F(1,40) =2.38,p=0.13.Scheib and colleagues (1999) have argued that the apparent appeal of symmetryis not driven by perceptions of symmetry. They found an association betweensymmetry (of the whole face) and attractiveness when only a hemiface was shown(Scheib et al. 1999). They argued that the appeal of symmetry must therefore bemediated by the appeal of some other correlated trait because symmetry is notpresent in hemifaces. However, there certainly are cues to symmetry in hemifaces.Forexample, if more than half of the nose or mouth is visible then the face cannotbe symmetric. Therefore, these results may not challenge the appeal of symmetry.Sexual Dimorphism
Sexual DimorphismMale and female faces diverge at puberty (Farkas 1988). In males, testosteronestimulates the growth of the jaw, cheekbones, brow ridges, center of the face (frombrow to bottom of nose), and facial hair. In females, growth of these traits isinhibited by estrogen, which may also increase lip size (see Thornhill & Møller1997 for a review). Because sexual dimorphism increases at puberty, sexuallydimorphic traits signal sexual maturity and reproductive potential (Johnston &Franklin 1993; Symons 1979, 1992, 1995; Thornhill & Gangestad 1996).Sexual dimorphism may also signal differences in mate quality between sexu-
ally mature individuals. In animals, large sexual ornaments can signal low parasiteloadings (Hamilton & Zuk 1982, Møller 1990, Wedekind 1992), although they donot always do so (Getty 2000, Møller et al. 1999). They can also signal immuno-competence, possibly because testosterone stresses the immune system, so thatonly healthy males can afford large male traits (Folstad & Karter 1992, Mølleret al. 1999, Peters 2000). Perhaps masculine facial traits could also signal healthand immunocompetence (Thornhill & Gangestad 1993, 1999). So too could fem-inine traits, if high levels of female hormones also stress the immune system (seeRhodes et al. 2003a for discussion). Masculine traits may also honestly signaldominance and status, which enhance mate value (Buss 1989, Mueller & Mazur1996).Forthese reasons, a preference for masculinity in male faces (and perhaps also
femininity in female faces) is a good candidate for a biologically based preference.Many animals, including humans, ﬁnd extreme sexually dimorphic body traitsattractive (Andersson 1994). But is sexual dimorphism attractive in faces?FEMININITY Femininity is clearly attractive in female faces. Whether femininetraits are measured (Cunningham 1986, Cunningham et al. 1995, Johnston &Franklin 1993, Jones & Hill 1993, Koehler et al. 2004), rated (Bruce et al. 1994,Dunkle & Francis 1990, Koehler et al. 2004, O’Toole et al. 1998, Rhodes et al.2003a), or manipulated (Johnston et al. 2001, Perrett et al. 1998, Rhodes et al.2000), they are attractive. Furthermore, composites of very attractive female faces

Exaggeration of femininefeatures further increases attractiveness (Johnston & Franklin 1993; Perrett et al.1994, 1998; Rhodes et al. 2000; Russell 2003). Finally, when people generatebeautiful female faces on a computer, they produce faces with more femininetraits (smaller chins, smaller lower face area, fuller lips) than average (Johnston &Franklin 1993).Overall, femininity is strongly attractive (0.64 ±0.39, 95% CI =0.51–0.74,N=18), with large effect sizes whether normal (0.64 ±0.46, N=9) or ma-nipulated (0.64 ±0.34, N=9) images are used. Most studies combined data
from male and female raters, so the effect of rater sex could not be examined.The preference generalizes across face race, at least for Caucasian, Asian, andJamaican faces (Penton-V oak et al. 2004, Perrett et al. 1998, Rhodes et al. 2000),with no signiﬁcant effect of face race, F(2,8) =0.87, p=0.45 (0.73 ±0.34,N=6, Western; 0.57 ±0.39, N=4, non-Western; 0.53 ±0,N=1, both).O’Toole et al. (1998) have suggested that female attractiveness may be virtuallysynonymous with femininity because attractiveness predicts time taken to classifythe sex of a female face almost as well as its femininity.Most studies used independent measures of attractiveness and femininity. Thosethat did not use independent measures yielded marginally larger effect sizes(0.82±0.21, N=3) than those that did (0.58 ±0.38, N=15), F(1,16) =4.29,p<0.06, supporting the need for independent measures, although the effect re-
mained large when independent indices were used. Too few studies were avail-able to assess possible publication bias in the funnel plot (see SupplementalMaterial link for Electronic Appendix 3 in the online version of this chapter athttp://www.annualreviews.org/).MASCULINITY The appeal of masculine traits is less clear. An early study us-ing schematic faces indicated that masculinized male faces (thick brows, thin lips,square chins, and small eyes) were preferred to feminized ones (Keating 1985), butmore recent studies using photographic sex continua generally show a preferencefor feminized male faces (Penton-V oak et al. 2004, Perrett et al. 1998, Rhodes et al.2000; but see Johnston et al. 2001). The meta-analysis conﬁrmed that masculinityis unattractive when these manipulated faces are used ( −0.47±0.51, N=12).
Perrett and colleagues (1998) suggest that this preference may reﬂect the percep-tion of more positive personality traits (less dominant, warmer, more honest andcooperative, and more likely to be a good parent) in less masculine faces.In these studies, masculinity was manipulated by varying the differences ofan averaged male composite from an averaged female composite. But averagedmale composites do not capture masculine traits well (for related concerns, seeJohnston et al. 2001, Meyer & Quong 1999, Swaddle & Reierson 2002). Maletraits like coarse skin textures and square jaws are generally lost in the averagingprocess, making male composites look less masculine than individual male faces(Little & Hancock 2002). Sex continua made using these composites may therefore
25 Oct 2005 15:50 AR ANRV264-PS57-08.tex XMLPublishSM(2004/02/24) P1: OKZ210 RHODEStell us little about the optimal level of masculinity. They may also bias responsesagainst the masculinized shapes that are inconsistent with the feminine skin texturesdisplayed. When testosterone-related traits are manipulated in individual malefaces, no preference for feminization (or masculinization) was observed (Swaddle&Reierson 2002).Studies with normal faces present quite a different picture. Ratings of masculin-
ity correlate positively with attractiveness, although the associations are weakerthan for femininity (Cunningham et al. 1990, Gillen 1981, Koehler et al. 2004,Neave et al. 2003, O’Toole et al. 1998, Rhodes et al. 2003a, Scheib et al. 1999).Measurement studies also suggest that masculine traits, such as large chins, canbe attractive in male faces (Cunningham et al. 1990, Grammer & Thornhill 1994,Penton-V oak et al. 2001, Scheib et al. 1999), although there are limitations to thesestudies. Few traits may be measured, and even then results may be inconsistentacross traits (e.g., Cunningham et al. 1990), and sexual dimorphism of the chosentraits is rarely validated (for exceptions, see Koehler et al. 2004, Penton-V oak et al.2001). The meta-analysis conﬁrmed that masculinity is attractive for normal malefaces (0.35 ±0.20, N=10), but not for faces from sex continua ( −0.47±0.51,N=12), F(1,20) =4.12, p<0.0002. There was no signiﬁcant effect of whether
or not independent indices were used for normal faces, F(1,8) =0.09, p=0.77(0.36 ±0.27, N=5, independent; 0.32 ±0.13, N=5, nonindependent). Thefunnel plot indicated a possible publication bias against small effects for normalfaces (see Supplemental Material link for Electronic Appendix 3 in the onlineversion of this chapter at http://www.annualreviews.org/).Both average and masculine traits contribute (independently) to male attractive-ness (Little & Hancock 2002, O’Toole et al. 1998). There may also be curvilinearcomponents to the relationship between masculinity and attractiveness, indicatingapreference for moderate rather than extreme levels of masculinity (Cunninghamet al. 1990). There are insufﬁcient data to determine whether masculinity is attrac-tive to both males and females, and in non-Western faces.MENSTRUAL CYCLE EFFECTS Women’s preferences shift toward relatively mascu-
line faces during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle (for women not on oralcontraceptives) (Frost 1994, Johnston et al. 2001, Penton-V oak et al. 1999, Penton-Voak & Perrett 2000b). Women in the fertile phase ﬁnd darker (more masculine)complexions more attractive in male (but not female) Caucasian faces (althoughlighter complexions were always optimal) (Frost 1994). More masculine images onmale-female shape continua are preferred in the fertile phase of the cycle, althoughthe preferred image varies from feminized (Penton-V oak et al. 1999) to average(Penton-V oak & Perrett 2000b) to masculinized (Johnston et al. 2001). Althoughthese continua do not represent masculinity veridically (see above), they do capturerelative masculinity. Rated masculinity and dominance (Perrett et al. 1998), and the
size of some male traits (chin length and eyebrow thickness) (Rhodes et al. 2000),all increase with increasing “masculinization” of the images. Therefore, relativelymore masculine traits are preferred when conception is likely. This cyclic shift has
25 Oct 2005 15:50 AR ANRV264-PS57-08.tex XMLPublishSM(2004/02/24) P1: OKZFACIAL BEAUTY 211been interpreted as evidence for adaptive preferences that are tuned to good geneswhen conception is likely (especially for short-term mates or extrapair partners)(Perrett et al. 1998). This interpretation requires that masculine traits are honestsignals of mate quality, an assumption that is examined below.SummaryAverageness and symmetry are both attractive in male and female faces, with
medium to large effect sizes in all cases. Sexual dimorphism is also attractive.Femininity is attractive in female faces and is preferred to averageness. Masculinityis also attractive in male faces, although the effect is smaller than for female faces,and average traits also contribute (independently) to male attractiveness. Reportedpreferences for feminized male faces appear to be an artifact of using sex continuathat do not adequately capture sexual dimorphism. Preferences for averageness,symmetry, and femininity generalize across race of face. It remains to be seenwhether the masculinity preference generalizes across race. Finally, note that ifaveraged composites of male faces fail to display typical levels of masculinity, assuggested above, then the conclusion that averageness is attractive in male facesmust rest primarily on the data from real faces.THE EVOLUTION OF PREFERENCES
THE EVOLUTION OF PREFERENCESWhat selection pressures might have shaped the evolution of these preferences? Tothe extent that preferences inﬂuence mate choice (see, e.g., Rhodes et al. 2005c),they could be sexually selected. In sexual selection, preferences evolve becausethey enhance reproductive success (Andersson 1994, Barrett et al. 2002). Sexualselection can also arise from competition between same-sex individuals (displaysand ﬁghts), but that component is not considered here. There are several modelsof sexual selection, and a central distinction is whether attractive traits signal matequality (for reviews, see Andersson 1994, Andersson & Iwasa 1996, Cronin 1991).Preferences could evolve in the absence of any link between attractive traitsand mate quality if attractive individuals have offspring who are preferred asmates (Fisher 1915). This Fisherian runaway selection can in principle drive theevolution of extreme sexual ornaments like the peacock’s tail, although it cannot
explain how preferences for arbitrary traits arise initially. The model requires thatboth preferences and attractive traits are heritable and evolve together. Nothing isknown about whether face preferences or attractive facial traits are heritable.Alternatively, attractive traits could signal mate quality so that preferences in-crease offspring viability (see, e.g., Hamilton & Zuk 1982, Zahavi 1975). Attractivemates would provide direct beneﬁts, such as resources, parental care, or reducedrisk of contagion, and/or indirect genetic beneﬁts, such as heritable resistanceto disease. Evidence for genetic beneﬁts has been found in several species (see,e.g., Møller & Alatalo 1999). The success of this “good genes” model has moti-vated much of the work on human face preferences and fueled suggestions that
25 Oct 2005 15:50 AR ANRV264-PS57-08.tex XMLPublishSM(2004/02/24) P1: OKZ212 RHODESface preferences are adaptations for mate choice (Etcoff 1999; Fink & Penton-Voak 2002; Grammer et al. 2003; Johnston & Franklin 1993; Symons 1979;Thornhill et al. 2003; Thornhill & Gangestad 1993, 1999; Thornhill & Møller1997).However, preferences can also result as “by-products” of the way brains pro-cess information (Endler & Basolo 1998, Ryan & Rand 1993). In these models,attractive traits elicit strong responses from perceptual systems. Such models mayexplain why preferences emerge for some traits rather than others, and they can evenexplain intriguing cases of preferences for traits that don’t occur in conspeciﬁcs(e.g., Basolo 1990). Although initially developed to account for the evolutionaryorigin of preferences (e.g., Ryan & Rand 1993), they have sometimes been pre-sented as alternatives to mate quality accounts of the origin and maintenance ofpreferences (e.g., Enquist et al. 2002).
In the following two sections, I consider how face preferences might haveevolved. Are preferences adaptations for mate choice, with attractive traits signal-ing mate quality? Or are they by-products of the way brains process information?Of course, multiple selection pressures can shape preferences (see, e.g., Wearyet al. 1993), and both mate quality and by-product models may be needed tounderstand the evolution of these preferences.Preferences a sAdaptations for Mate ChoiceAdaptations are specialized mechanisms that evolved to solve a speciﬁc problem(Williams 1966). On the mate quality account, face preferences are adaptationsfor mate choice. In this view, the psychological mechanisms used to assess attrac-tiveness should show evidence of design for identifying good mates (Thornhill&Gangestad 1999). For example, faces that look healthy should be perceived as
attractive, and they are (Grammer & Thornhill 1994, Henderson & Anglin 2003,Jones et al. 2001, Kalick et al. 1998). However, such results could reﬂect a powerfulattractiveness halo effect, whereby positive traits like health are indiscriminatelyattributed to attractive individuals. One study has attempted to rule out a halo ac-count by showing that symmetry looks healthy when attractiveness is statisticallycontrolled, but it’s not clear how this association reﬂects mechanisms for assessingattractiveness (Jones et al. 2001).Many researchers have attempted to test the mate quality hypothesis by ex-
amining whether attractive traits currently reﬂect mate quality. This approach hasbeen challenged because good nutrition and modern medicine could have brokenany links with health (just as modern contraception breaks links with reproductivesuccess) (Daly & Wilson 1999; Thornhill & Gangestad 1996, 1999). Neverthe-less, it is informative about the selection pressures that maintain preferences, andto the extent that the past resembles the present, it may be informative about pastselection pressures.Quality has many components—health, intelligence, fertility, parental carepotential—but most research has focused on whether attractive facial traits signal
25 Oct 2005 15:50 AR ANRV264-PS57-08.tex XMLPublishSM(2004/02/24) P1: OKZFACIAL BEAUTY 213health. The anatomical complexity of faces would make them susceptible to stres-sors during development, and our expertise as face perceivers would make ussensitive to any resulting variation (Peterson & Rhodes 2003). So it is plausiblethat faces might signal health and that we would be sensitive to any such signals.Wesaw above that attractive faces are perceived as healthy, but is this honestadvertising?ATTRACTIVENESS AND HEALTH Meta-analyses suggest a weak association of at-
tractiveness with mental health and a moderate association with physical health(Feingold 1992, Langlois et al. 2000). However, the latter result was based ononly ﬁve studies, some of which used dubious health measures (e.g., self-reportedsymptoms over brief periods). More recently, Hume & Montgomerie (2001) re-ported a moderate association of attractiveness with physical health for womenbutnot for men, using self-reported lifetime incidence and severity of diseases.The study with the best lifetime health data comes from Kalick and colleagues
(1998). They studied a large sample for which records of the incidence and severityof infectious diseases were available from the Institute of Human Development.Furthermore, these individuals were born in the 1920s, prior to the use of antibi-otics and vaccinations that may disrupt links between attractiveness and health.There was no signiﬁcant relationship between attractiveness at age 17 and health(or number of offspring) either during development or later in life. However,arecent reanalysis of these data found a moderate association between attrac-tiveness at 17 and later (adult) health for faces below the median in attractive-ness (Zebrowitz & Rhodes 2004). Interestingly, attractiveness in a mate is valuedmore in societies with high parasitism rates and poorer health (Gangestad & Buss1993).Male facial attractiveness is also associated with heterozygosity in the major
histocompatibility complex, which plays an important role in immune function(Roberts et al. 2005), indicating a possible link with immunocompetence. At-tractiveness is moderately associated with longevity (Henderson & Anglin 2003),weakly associated with physical ﬁtness, independent of current exercise levels(Honekopp et al. 2004), and moderately to strongly associated with indices ofsperm quality (Soler et al. 2003).Takentogether, these studies suggest links between facial attractiveness andhealth, at least when the organism is sufﬁciently challenged. However, the evidenceis far from strong. Several studies need replication and many are methodologicallyweak, with poor health measures (e.g., Shackelford & Larsen 1999) or small sam-ples (Henderson & Anglin 2003). Of course, not all components of attractivenessare expected to signal health (e.g., pleasant expressions). Below, I consider thosethat are.AVERAGENESS AND HEALTH Marked deviations from facial averageness occur in
some chromosomal disorders (Hoyme 1994, Thornhill & Møller 1997). In theInstitute of Human Development sample, ﬁrst studied by Kalick and colleagues
25 Oct 2005 15:50 AR ANRV264-PS57-08.tex XMLPublishSM(2004/02/24) P1: OKZ214 RHODES(1998), facial averageness at 17 years was moderately associated with childhoodhealth for males and weakly associated with current annual health for females(Rhodes et al. 2001c). These associations were driven by faces below medianaverageness (Zebrowitz & Rhodes 2004). These results indicate a link betweenfacial averageness and health in both clinical and nonclinical samples. How-ever, this conclusion rests on a single nonclinical sample. Clearly, replication isneeded.SYMMETRY AND HEALTH There is little evidence that human facial symmetry sig-nals health. The best evidence is that facial asymmetries are associated with somechromosomal disorders (Hoyme 1994, Thornhill & Møller 1997). However, with-out evidence that similar asymmetries do not occur in healthy individuals, wecannot be sure that facial asymmetry is a valid signal of ill health.
Furthermore, despite numerous attempts, no studies have found a convincinglink between facial symmetry and health in nonclinical samples. Neither ratednor measured facial symmetry was associated with health at any point during de-velopment in the Institute of Human Development sample (Rhodes et al. 2001c).Weak associations have been reported between measured facial asymmetry andafewself-reported health symptoms over a brief period in a student sample, butthe results failed to replicate in a second sample (Shackelford & Larsen 1997).Moreover, more than 1000 correlations were examined, raising the probability oftype I statistical errors. Hume & Montgomerie (2001) found weak, nonsigniﬁ-cant associations between asymmetry (combined body and face) and self-reportedlifetime health problems. No clear associations have been found between facialasymmetry and self-reported health symptoms or physiological ﬁtness (Honekoppet al. 2004, Tomkinson & Olds 2000).
Could it be that a preference for facial symmetry evolved because of a pastlink with health that has been broken by modern medicine? Evidence for a linkbetween symmetry and health in populations from harsher environments wouldsupport such a hypothesis. However, in the absence of such evidence, and the factthat links between health and averageness have not been broken, the broken linkhypothesis is unconvincing.Could these largely negative results reﬂect failure to isolate FA, which is thetheoretically relevant variable? Perhaps yes, but symmetry ratings, which may beagood proxy for FA (Simmons et al. 2004), also showed little association withhealth (Rhodes et al. 2001c). Interestingly, meta-analyses have cast doubt on linksbetween FA and health (condition) in nonhuman animals (Polak 2003, Tomkins&Simmons 2003).SEXUAL DIMORPHISM AND HEALTH Many studies indicate a link between sec-
ondary sexual traits and health in male animals (e.g., Møller et al. 1999). Limitedhuman data suggest a link between sexually dimorphic traits and health in malefaces. In the Institute of Human Development sample, facial masculinity wasweakly, but signiﬁcantly, associated with adolescent health in males (Rhodes et al.
25 Oct 2005 15:50 AR ANRV264-PS57-08.tex XMLPublishSM(2004/02/24) P1: OKZFACIAL BEAUTY 2152003a). Again, this link was restricted to faces that were below the median in mas-culinity, suggesting that low levels of masculinity signal poor health (Zebrowitz &Rhodes 2004). Curiously, although femininity is more attractive than masculinity,no link was found with health for female faces (Rhodes et al. 2003a).SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS Facial attractiveness and some of its componentsmay have modest associations with health, although the evidence is far from over-whelming. The link may be strongest when stress is greatest, with unattractivedeviations from averageness and symmetry associated with some chromosomaldisorders and associations in nonclinical samples often limited to faces below themedian in attractiveness. In nonclinical samples, links with health have been foundfor averageness and masculinity (male faces) but not for symmetry or femininity(female faces).
Before interpreting these results, we should consider their limitations. Healthgenerally has not been measured well. Subjective and unvalidated self-report mea-sures of illnesses or symptoms often are used. These are vulnerable to memoryfailures and biases whereby unattractive individuals, who may be unhappy because
of poorer treatment (see, e.g., Langlois et al. 2000), recall more negative experi-ences (see, e.g., Teasdale & Russell 1983) than do more attractive individuals.Self-reports of recent symptoms are less susceptible to memory biases but pro-vide limited information about health. Only the Institute for Human Developmentsample has health scores based on detailed, lifetime medical records. Overall, thenumber of studies is small, and relatively few unpublished data sets with no as-sociation between appearance and health could change the picture. More studiesare needed that use samples for which objective, detailed health information isavailable. Samples from traditional societies, where modern medical interventionsare limited, would also be informative if good health information was available.Notwithstanding these caveats, the reported associations of health with attrac-
tiveness and some of its components suggest that preferences are not arbitrary, butinstead may be adaptations for mate choice. In some cases, the associations wererestricted to faces below the median in attractiveness, possibly reﬂecting strongerselection pressure to avoid low-quality mates than to make distinctions amonghigher-quality individuals.Little is known about whether attractive individuals provide indirect geneticbeneﬁts, such as heritable resistance to disease, or direct beneﬁts, such as re-duced risk of contagion or better parental care, or both. The better treatmentand outcomes afforded attractive individuals could contribute to any direct ben-eﬁts. Any preference for genetically heterozygous individuals would presum-ably evolve via direct beneﬁts because heterozygosity is not heritable. The samewould be true for the preference for averageness, if its health beneﬁts result
from heterozygosity (Gangestad & Buss 1993, Thornhill & Gangestad 1993).However, some heritable beneﬁts seem likely, given the heritability of health(Bouchard et al. 1990, Flint & Goodwin 1999, Reed & Dick 2003, Winkelman et al.2000).
25 Oct 2005 15:50 AR ANRV264-PS57-08.tex XMLPublishSM(2004/02/24) P1: OKZ216 RHODESFemininity is the strongest component of female attractiveness, but it showedno association with health (although only one study has looked for this). Femi-ninity may signal fertility rather than health per se (Johnston 2000, Johnston &Franklin 1993, Symons 1979). The reasoning is that high estrogen/androgen ratiosare associated with both feminine characteristics (e.g., small jaw, full lips) andfertility. A preference for feminine faces, therefore, would target sexually maturefemales. Facial femininity could also signal individual differences in fertility inadult females, to the extent that femininity declines with age.The hallmark of an adaptation is specialized design (Williams 1966). The shift
to prefer more masculine male faces at the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle couldbe a specialization for obtaining indirect genetic beneﬁts when conception is likely,given that masculinity signals health (Rhodes et al. 2003a). However, it remainsto be seen whether the health beneﬁts are heritable. An increased preference forhealthy-looking faces in the luteal (postfertile) phase of the menstrual cycle hasbeen interpreted as a specialization for obtaining direct beneﬁts, such as reducedrisk of contagion, after conception (Jones et al. 2004). Interestingly, no cyclicchange has been found in the preference for facial symmetry (Koehler et al. 2002),which appears to be a poorer indicator of health.Another possible specialization is a preference for mixed-race faces, which
look healthier than single-race faces (Rhodes et al. 2005b). If parents from differ-ent races are more likely to have different locally adapted gene complexes thanare parents from the same race, then a preference for mixed-race faces could be aspecialization for obtaining heterozygous mates with enhanced disease resistance.Alternatively, a preference for mixed-race faces could be an inbreeding avoidancemechanism.Restriction of preferences to opposite-sex faces could indicate specialized de-sign for mate choice. However, there is no evidence for such restriction (see meta-analyses). Nor does a restriction of preference seem likely, given the similarity ofmale and female faces; its absence is certainly not evidence against preferencesbeing adaptations for mate choice.Preferences as By-Products of How Brains ProcessInfor mationBy-product accounts attribute preferences to general information processing mech-
anisms that evolved through natural selection, in the absence of any link withmate quality. However, there does seem to be a link between attractive traitsand health, so where does this leave by-product accounts? One possibility isthat multiple selection pressures have shaped preferences (Weary et al. 1993).Forexample, attractive traits may arise as by-products of information process-ing systems but subsequently may evolve into honest indicators of mate qual-ity (Garcia & Ramirez 2005). Alternatively, information-processing mechanismsmay determine which of many honest indicators of mate quality come to bepreferred.
25 Oct 2005 15:50 AR ANRV264-PS57-08.tex XMLPublishSM(2004/02/24) P1: OKZFACIAL BEAUTY 217Avariety of information-processing mechanisms has been proposed to con-tribute to the evolution of preferences. Symmetry and averageness preferenceshave both been attributed to generalization effects in recognition (Enquist & Arak1994, Jansson et al. 2002, Johnstone 1994). When trained to treat slightly asym-metric patterns as members of the same category, generalization produces strongresponses to the symmetric category prototype or average. Preferences for extremesexual dimorphism have been attributed to learning mechanisms that produce “peakshift,” whereby extreme exemplars generate stronger responses than do the trainingexemplars in discrimination learning (Enquist & Arak 1994, Enquist et al. 2002,Guilford & Dawkins 1991, Weary et al. 1993).Support for these accounts initially came from neural network simulations, in
which preferences emerged from a variety of training situations in the absenceof any link between the preferred traits and mate quality. These simulations maynot behave like real biological recognition systems (Dawkins & Guilford 1995),butstudies with animals and humans yield similar results (Ghirlanda et al. 2002,Jansson et al. 2002, Rhodes 1996). It remains an open question, however, whetherthe natural environment provides the kind of “training” needed to induce the facepreferences that we have, although attempts have been made to address this ques-tion for animal preferences (Weary et al. 1993). Nor is it obvious that strongresponses in recognition tasks are the same as preferences, which have affectiveand motivational components.Apreference for average (and symmetric) faces could also be a by-product of
their subjective familiarity and a preference for familiar stimuli (Bornstein 1989,Halberstadt et al. 2003, Langlois & Roggman 1990, Langlois et al. 1994, Lightet al. 1981, Rhodes et al. 2001a, Zajonc 1968). It is currently unclear just howfamiliarity and associated perceptual ﬂuency (Reber et al. 2004) contribute to thesepreferences (Corneille et al. 2005, Langlois et al. 1994, Monin 2003), although theappeal of average faces does not seem to be a generalized mere exposure effect(Halberstadt et al. 2003; Rhodes et al. 2001a, 2005a).If preferences are by-products of the way that brains process information, then
they should not be restricted to potential mates but should occur widely for familiarstimuli. And they do. Average exemplars are attractive in every category examined(Halberstadt & Rhodes 2000, 2003; Halberstadt et al. 2003), and symmetry isattractive for many stimuli (Corballis & Beale 1976, Kubovy 2000). The generalityof these preferences suggests that general information-processing mechanismscontribute to them. An interesting exception may be inverted faces, for which asymmetry preference is not found (Little & Jones 2003). However, this result isnot inconsistent with recognition by-product accounts that require experience withaclass of objects for preferences to emerge because inverted faces are rarely seen(see, e.g., Enquist et al. 2002).The original goal of by-product accounts of preferences was to explain the
ultimate (evolutionary) causes of preferences. However, they are also informa-tive about their proximate causes, i.e., the psychological mechanisms that cur-rently generate preferences. The studies reviewed above suggest that a variety of
25 Oct 2005 15:50 AR ANRV264-PS57-08.tex XMLPublishSM(2004/02/24) P1: OKZ218 RHODESinformation-processing mechanisms contribute to our preferences. These includemechanisms that abstract category prototypes and generalize responses from ex-emplars to prototypes and learning mechanisms that respond strongly to extremeexemplars.CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONSAn evolutionary perspective in psychology is not new, as the William James quote
at the outset of this chapter indicates. However, the past decade has seen evolu-tionary psychology emerge as a distinct ﬁeld within psychology (Barkow et al.1992, Barrett et al. 2002, Pinker 1997). In this chapter, we have seen how an evo-lutionary perspective has shaped research on facial attractiveness. We have seenthat averageness, symmetry, and sexual dimorphism are attractive in both male andfemale faces (contrary to recent claims that feminine male faces are attractive).Wehave seen some evidence that attractive traits may signal health, which is animportant aspect of mate quality, although the evidence is far from compelling.And we have seen that the way our brains process information also shapes ourpreferences.There are many exciting directions for future research. More studies are needed
on whether facial attractiveness and its components signal health and other as-pects of mate quality. Recently, male facial attractiveness has been linked to ge-netic heterozygosity at sites involved in immune function. Future studies shoulddetermine which components of male attractiveness (masculinity, averageness,symmetry) mediate this link, and whether female attractiveness is also linkedto heterozygosity at these sites. A more direct test of a link between attractive-ness and immunocompetence could also be done by challenging the immunesystem.Weknow little about whether preferences generate heritable genetic beneﬁts
as proposed by the good genes model. We know little about the heritability ofattractive facial traits and face preferences, as required by both Fisherian and goodgenes models. We know little about how facial attractiveness interacts with bodyattractiveness to determine overall attractiveness. We know that newborn infantsprefer to look at faces that adults ﬁnd attractive but know little about what traits theyprefer. We know little about whether preferences change during development (e.g.,at puberty). We know little about individual differences in face preferences, andwhether they reﬂect different optimal strategies for individuals of differing matevalue (Little et al. 2001, Penton-V oak et al. 2003) or self-similarity preferences
(Buston & Emlen 2003, De Bruine 2004). We know that experience affects whatwe ﬁnd attractive (Perrett et al. 2002, 2003; Rhodes et al. 2003b), but we know littleabout the temporal dynamics of these effects, including whether there are sensitiveperiods in which experience has stronger effects and whether sexual imprintingoccurs in humans (Little & Perrett 2002).
