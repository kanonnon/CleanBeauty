Dietary nutrient intakes and skin-aging appearance among middle-aged American women1/H110024Maeve C Cosgrove, Oscar H Franco, Stewart P Granger, Peter G Murray, and Andrew E MayesABSTRACTBackground: Nutritional factors play a key role in normal derma-tologic functioning. However, little is known about the effects of dieton skin-aging appearance.Objective: We evaluated the associations between nutrient intakesand skin-aging appearance.Design: Using data from the first National Health and NutritionExamination Survey, we examined associations between nutrientintakes and skin aging in 4025 women (40–74 y). Nutrients wereestimated from a 24-h recall. Clinical examinations of the skin wereconducted by dermatologists. Skin-aging appearance was defined ashaving a wrinkled appearance, senile dryness, and skin atrophy.Results: Higher vitamin C intakes were associated with a lower
likelihood of a wrinkled appearance [odds ratio (OR) 0.89; 95% CI:0.82, 0.96] and senile dryness (OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.99). Higherlinoleic acid intakes were associated with a lower likelihood of seniledryness (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.88) and skin atrophy (OR: 0.78;95% CI 0.65, 0.95). A 17-g increase in fat and a 50-g increase incarbohydrate intakes increased the likelihood of a wrinkled appear-ance (OR: 1.28 and 1.36, respectively) and skin atrophy (OR: 1.37and 1.33, respectively). These associations were independent of age,race, education, sunlight exposure, income, menopausal status, bodymass index, supplement use, physical activity, and energy intake.Conclusions: Higher intakes of vitamin C and linoleic acid andlower intakes of fats and carbohydrates are associated with betterskin-aging appearance. Promoting healthy dietary behaviors mayhave additional benefit for skin appearance in addition to otherhealth outcomes in the population. Am J Clin Nutr 2007;86:1225–31.

Among these factors, the harmful effects ofchronic sun exposure (photoaging) and smoking on prematureskin aging are widely supported (6–9). During the course of skinaging, both skin function and appearance are affected. Changesin appearance are the most visible signs of aging and includewrinkles, irregular pigmentation, sagging, atrophy, elastosis, andtelangiectasia (1, 6). Such changes in appearance have substan-tial negative affects on self-esteem and social well-being (10).Furthermore, appearance was shown to be an indicator of overall
health status, and it has been shown that “looking old for one’sage” is associated with increased risk of mortality (11, 12).Balanced nutrition is essential not only to prevent chronicdisease such as cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, and di-abetes (13) but also to maintain health and ensure normal func-tioning. Certain nutrients were identified to play a critical role inthe normal functioning of the skin, particularly when nutrientdeficiencies are apparent, eg, vitamin C in collagen synthesis (14,15). Several studies have observed improved protection of theskin against sun damage (photoprotection) by dietary supple-mentation with vitamins E and C, carotenoids (/H9252-carotene and
/H9252-carotene and
lycopene), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (16, 17).However, those studies are limited by the use of supplements,some with several active ingredients, making it difficult to de-termine which nutrient is having an effect. One study observed aphotoprotective effect of a diet higher in vegetables, fruit, andolive oil on the skin (18). Whether habitual dietary intakes havea significant effect on skin-aging appearance has not been shown.This is critical to adequately design potential interventions tar-geted to improve or delay the skin-aging process. Therefore, inthe present cross-sectional analysis, using the first NationalHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) (19), weexamined the relation between nutrient intakes and the preva-lence of the appearance of wrinkles, senile dryness (dryness as aresult of aging), and skin atrophy (thinning) in middle-agedwomen. This examination allowed us to examine the relationbetween nutrient intakes, rather than supplements, and
nutrient intakes, rather than supplements, and skin-aging appearance, rather than photoprotection, for the first timeto our knowledge.

(19). Briefly, NHANES I was conducted on a nationwide sampleof/L5051432 000 noninstitutionalized persons aged 1–74 y. Details ofmethods, including the development, plan, and operation of thesurvey and data collection forms have been published and areavailable elsewhere (20–22).Study sampleAll women aged /L5087140 y were eligible for inclusion. From theoriginal available sample of 23 808 subjects, 10 152 men, 8477women aged /L5014140 y, 1062 women who did not have a dermato-logic examination, and 92 women with unsatisfactory 24-h di-etary recalls were excluded. The final sample consisted of 4025women aged 40–74 y.Assessment of skin agingA complete clinical dermatologic examination of the skin was
undertaken to evaluate variations in texture and color, certainmanifestations of aging, and all pathologic changes. The derma-tologic examinations were performed by 101 dermatologists thatfollowed a studywide protocol after uniform training and stan-dardized definitions (23). To ensure consistency with the exam-ination protocol, a random sample of the 20 637 examinationswas checked by a senior dermatologist (24). The dermatologistclassified the subjects into 1 of 3 categories of cumulative life-time sunlight exposure: 1) low (unimpressive), 2) moderate, and3) high (considerable), based on the subjects’ occupation andamount of leisure time spent outdoors. Skin aging was defined by3 independent determinants of the process: wrinkled appearance,senile dryness (dryness as a result of aging), and skin atrophy(thinning).Dietary assessmentA 24-h dietary recall was administered to each respondent by
a trained dietary interviewer, with 3-dimensional food models,including household measures, to estimate food portions (23).The interviewer probed for clarity of foods and beverages con-sumed and for commonly forgotten items (eg, sugar in tea, bev-erages with meals). Estimates of nutrient intake for each food andbeverage reported were obtained from the US Department ofAgriculture food composition data (25).Assessment of other variablesHeight and weight were measured using standard methods(26), and BMI was calculated. The physical activity questionabout nonrecreational activity was: “In your usual day, asidefrom recreation, how active are you?” The possible responseswere 1) very active, 2) moderately active, or 3) quite inactive.Additional covariate information about age, smoking habits,menopausal status, race, education, and family income was ob-tained with the use of questionnaires.Statistical analysesWe first conducted univariate analyses to describe the distri-
bution of nutrient intakes and demographic and lifestyle at-tributes by having a wrinkled appearance, senile dryness, andskin atrophy. Significant differences were assessed using Pear-son’s chi-square and independent ttests for categorical andcontinuous variables, respectively. Differences in mean nutrientintakes were assessed with the use of analysis of variance,adjusting for age (continuous), race (white, black, other),energy intake (continuous), education [ /L5014112 y, high schoolgraduation (12 y), /L5014012 y], sunlight exposure (unimpressive,moderate, considerable), total family income ( /L50141$5000, $5000–9999;/L50871$10 000), menopausal status (responded yes to the ques-
tion “Have your menstrual periods stopped entirely?” comparedwith no), BMI (continuous), supplement use (responded yes tothe question “Are you taking vitamins or minerals?” comparedwith no), and self-reported daily physical activity (very active,moderately active, quite inactive). Intakes of linoleic acid, totaldietary cholesterol, calcium, and vitamins A and C were logtransformed, because they were not normally distributed.To determine the associations of nutrient intakes with skin-aging appearance, nutrients that substantially changed the effecton the outcomes ( P/L501410.2) were examined with the use of binary
To determine the associations of nutrient intakes with skin-aging appearance, nutrients that substantially changed the effecton the outcomes ( P/L501410.2) were examined with the use of binarylogistic regression analysis (27). We used logistic regressionmodels in 3808 women with complete data, controlling for age,race, energy intake, education, sunlight exposure, family in-come, menopausal status, BMI, supplement use, and physicalactivity to determine the associations of fat, carbohydrate, thia-mine, and vitamin C with a wrinkled appearance; of saturatedfatty acids, oleic acid, linoleic acid, and vitamin C with seniledryness; and of fat, carbohydrate, and linoleic acid with skinatrophy. Variables that substantially changed the effect on theoutcomes examined ( P/L501410.2) (27) or were associated with skin
aging in prior studies (3–5, 22) were considered as potentialconfounders. Family income may be related to skin-aging ap-pearance thorough pathways other than its influence on diet;therefore, it was included in all models. The odds ratio (OR)represents the odds for a 1-unit increment (eg , 1 g protein). Toillustrate nutritionally relevant estimates, new ORs were calcu-lated on the basis of 33% of the median intake for each nutrient(except for log-transformed nutrients and thiamine, whose me-dian intake was /L501411 mg) (28).Subgroup analysisCigarette smoking is a well-established independent risk fac-tor for facial wrinkling and skin aging (6–9). In this analysis,smoking data were only collected for 1401 women ( n/L1155539current and previous smokers; n/L1155862 never smoked). There-fore, stratified analysis was conducted to examine skin-agingappearance without ignoring the smoking data or losing largesample numbers because of the missing data.
We used a Pvalue/L501410.05 for significance, and all tests were2-sided. All analyses were performed with SPSS, version 14(SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).RESULTSCharacteristics of the study sampleA wrinkled appearance was present in 899 (22.3%), seniledryness in 1159 (28.8%), and skin atrophy in 515 (12.8%)women. The distribution of the skin-aging appearance in the4025 women is shown by the presence or absence of wrinkles,senile dryness, and skin atrophy in Figure 1 . Of the 3 signs ofskin-aging appearance, wrinkles were significantly correlatedwith senile dryness ( r/L11550.36) and skin atrophy ( r/L11550.52). Seniledryness was significantly correlated with skin atrophy ( r/L11550.30).Characteristics of all women and of each outcome separately areshown in Table 1 . Skin-aging outcomes were found significantly1226 COSGROVE ET AL
in older women; women with a wrinkled appearance, senile dry-ness, and skin atrophy were /L5051410 y, 10 y, and 9 y older, respec-tively. Women with the appearance of wrinkles, with senile dry-ness, and with skin atrophy were more likely to be white, have/L5014112 y education, have a low family income, be postmenopausal,and have higher sunlight exposure. Women with skin atrophywere significantly associated with a lower BMI, and women witha wrinkled appearance and with senile dryness were less likely tobe physically active. No significant differences in supplementusers and skin-aging outcomes were observed.Distribution of nutrient intakes by skin-aging appearanceMultivariate-adjusted means for nutrient intakes (adjusted forage, race, energy intake, education, sunlight exposure, familyincome, menopausal status, BMI, supplement use, and physicalactivity) are shown by outcomes of skin-aging appearance inTable 2 . Women with a wrinkled appearance had significantly
lower intakes of protein, total dietary cholesterol, phosphorus,potassium, vitamin A, and vitamin C than did women without awrinkled appearance. Women with senile dry skin had signifi-cantly lower intakes of linoleic acid and vitamin C than didwomen without senile dry skin.

significantly lower linoleic acid intake than did women withoutskin atrophy.Logistic regression analysis of nutrient intake and skin-aging appearanceMultivariate-adjusted logistic regression ORs for skin-agingappearance outcomes with selected nutrient intakes are shown inTable 3 . A 1-unit increase on the log scale in intakes of vitaminC were associated with an 11% reduction in the odds of a wrin-kled appearance and a 7% reduction in the odds of senile dryness.Similarly, a 1-unit increase on the log scale in intakes of linoleicacid were associated with 25% and 22% reductions in the odds ofsenile dryness and skin atrophy, respectively. A 17-g increase infat and a 50-g increase in carbohydrate intakes increased the ORsof a wrinkled appearance and skin atrophy. The multivariate-adjusted logistic regression models yielded an R2of 0.17, 0.16,and 0.15 for a wrinkled appearance, senile dryness, and skinatrophy, respectively. Variables that substantially affected the
regression coefficients in the models were age, race, and sunlightexposure for all outcomes, plus menopausal status for wrinklesand senile dryness and BMI for skin atrophy. Supplement usewas not significantly associated with any of the 3 signs of skin-aging appearance; no interactions were observed between meannutrient intakes and supplement use (data not shown).Subgroup analysisIn NHANES I, smoking data were collected for a subsample ofadults. In this study smoking information was available for only1401 women, of which 539 (38%) were smokers (current andprevious) and 862 (62%) had never smoked. The mean age ofsmokers was 54.5 y; the mean age of nonsmokers was 58.5 y(P/L501410.001). In this subgroup the majority of the associations
observed between nutrients and skin-aging appearance in thetotal population remained after the stratification for smoking.Furthermore, additional associations were observed amongsmokers. Smokers with a wrinkled appearance had significantlylower intakes of protein and niacin than did smokers withoutwrinkled appearance ( P/L501410.05), and smokers with skin atrophyhad higher calcium intakes than did smokers without skinatrophy ( P/L501410.05) (data not shown).TABLE 2Nutrient intakes in women by the appearance of skin aging1NutrientsWrinkled appearance Senile dryness Skin atrophyAbsence(n/L11552925)Presence(n/L1155856) P2Absence(n/L11552705)Presence(n/L11551103) P2Absence(n/L11553322)Presence(n/L1155486) P2Protein (g/d) 57.2 /L505120.34354.8/L505120.66 0.002 57.0 /L505120.36 55.9 /L505120.59 0.124 56.8 /L505120.32 55.4 /L505120.86 0.115Fat (g/d) 55.5 /L505120.27 55.9 /L505120.52 0.486 55.5 /L505120.28 55.7 /L505120.46 0.798 55.5 /L505120.25 55.8 /L505120.67 0.691

DISCUSSIONWe found that higher intakes of vitamin C and linoleic acid andlower intakes of fats and carbohydrates were associated withbetter skin-aging appearance (lower prevalence of wrinkledappearance, senile dryness, and skin atrophy) independent offactors known to affect skin aging.Lower intakes of vitamin C were significantly associated with
the prevalence of a wrinkled appearance and senile dryness,independent of age, sun exposure, race, menopausal status, en-ergy intake, education, family income, BMI, supplement use,and physical activity. To our knowledge, this is the first study todirectly relate dietary intakes of vitamin C with skin aging. Inskin, vitamin C exerts different biologic roles, including partic-ipation in collagen synthesis, the regeneration process, andwound repair (29). Vitamin C is an important antioxidant foundin the skin and may lower the prevalence of wrinkles and seniledryness by its actions as an antioxidant (29). Moreover, severalstudies have shown that vitamin C has photoprotective propertiesthrough oral or topical applications (17). Topical application ofvitamin C shows photoprotective properties and suggests im-provements of wrinkles (30, 31). Reviewing dietary supplemen-tation, Boelsma et al (16) identified 4 studies that showed aphotoprotective effect of vitamin C on skin. Those studies
effect of vitamin C on skin. Those studies wereshort-term supplementation trials with high doses of vitamin Cand in combination with vitamin E, whereas our findings arefrom habitual intakes of vitamin C from food sources.
Our results also suggest that a higher dietary intake of linoleicacid has a beneficial role in reducing the chances of developingsenile dryness and skin atrophy in middle-aged women. Linoleicacid (n/L11526 PUFA) is an essential fatty acid that cannot be pro-duced endogenously and is converted after ingestion to otherPUFAs such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexae-noic acid (DHA). The association between linoleic acid intakeand skin aging has not been investigated; however, several stud-ies have examined the photoprotective effects of EPA and DHAintakes from fish-oil supplements (16, 17). Topical application ofEPA has also showed photoprotective properties (32). Linoleicacid may therefore lower the prevalence of senile dryness andskin atrophy by acting as a source of EPA and DHA. Further-more, low intake of linoleic acid can lead to dermatitis withmarked abnormalities (16, 33), and this could also be importantin its role in skin-aging appearance.
Our results also suggest that a higher dietary intake of fats andcarbohydrates has a negative role in skin-aging appearance. Toour knowledge this is the first study to show an associationbetween dietary intakes of fats and carbohydrates with features ofskin aging. Furthermore, higher thiamine intakes were associ-ated with an increased likelihood of a wrinkled appearance.Thiamine is an essential B vitamin found in enriched cereals andwhole grains. More research is needed to understand theseassociations.Our findings add evidence to a predominately supplement and
topical application-based hypothesis that what we eat affects ourskin-aging appearance. One other study by Purba et al (18) hasreported a significant effect of vegetables, fruit, and olive oil onwrinkles; however, they examined the effect on skin surfacemicrostructure photodamage, whereas in our study we looked atthe effect of nutrient intakes on visual features of skin aging thatwere determined by trained dermatologists. Because most exist-ing evidence comes from supplemental trials or topical applica-tion of nutrients (16–18, 30–32, 34), our study adds to the ex-isting evidence in this field, because it examined nutrient intakesfrom foods rather than from nutritional supplements.Although vitamin A has long been noted to have antiwrinkle
Although vitamin A has long been noted to have antiwrinkleproperties, and retinol (vitamin A) is commonly used in thecosmetics industry as a topical antiwrinkle agent (34, 35), clinicaltrials have failed to show this effect when taken orally as sup-plements. Our findings that women with a wrinkled appearancehad lower vitamin A intakes support the evidence that vitamin Abenefits skin-aging appearance. We also found that women witha wrinkled appearance had lower protein intakes. Lower proteinintakes in older adults were shown to increase skin fragility (36).Vitamin A and protein however did not affect the prevalence ofa wrinkled appearance in the multivariate-adjusted logistic re-gression models.The favorable association of vitamin C and linoleic acid in-
takes with skin aging may be attributed to the dietary sources ofthese nutrients. At the time of this survey, the main sources ofvitamin C in the US diet were orange juice (more than a quarterof total vitamin C intake), citrus fruit, fruit juices, and tomatoes(37). Linoleic acid is found in oils such as rapeseed and soybeanoils and in foods such as green leafy vegetables and nuts (38).Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the body can convert linoleicacid into EPA and DHA (n /L11523 PUFAs). These nutrients were not
measured in NHANES I, but their main dietary sources are fishand fish oils (39). Current dietary recommendations promotehigher intakes of fruit and vegetables and fish and PUFAs (13, 40,41). Despite several campaigns to promote the consumption offruit and vegetables and the evidence that diets poor in fruit andvegetables are associated with poor health outcomes, most adultsare still not eating enough fruit and vegetables (42, 43). There-fore, a benefit for skin-aging appearance from eating aspects ofa healthy diet, such as fruit, vegetables, nuts, and fish, and re-ducing fat intake may motivate people and improve current pro-motions for healthy eating.Our findings need to be interpreted while considering some
limitations. This study is a cross-sectional analysis, and no con-clusions about the direction of associations between nutrientintakes and skin-aging appearance can be determined. NHANESI data were collected in 1971–1975 and a cohort effect cannot beruled out. Furthermore, changes in nutrient intakes have occurredin the past 30 y (44); hence, extrapolation to current populationsmight be affected. Although we used NHANES I data, which has
a well-characterized population with good measures of a numberof variables such as age, sun exposure, race, BMI, and meno-pausal status, allowing potential confounding to be controlledfor, residual confounding cannot be discarded. One factor thatwas not measured was the use of facial cosmetics. Nevertheless,on the basis of current knowledge we cannot determine whetheruse of such products is modified by nutrient intake. The derma-tologic component of this survey was not designed to specificallydetect associations between nutrients and skin appearance; there-fore, post hoc analyses have to be interpreted with caution. How-ever, few studies exist in which comprehensive measures of bothdietary intake data and skin-aging appearance are present andthus can be used to test the hypothesis of this study. The dietarydata were collected using a 24-h dietary recall. Estimates from asingle day of intake may not represent usual, long-term intakes,because of day-to-day variation in the subjects’

However, this study used trained interviewers to improve datacollection.This is the first study to examine the effect of nutrient intakes
rather than supplements on skin-aging appearance. Our findingssuggest that higher intakes of vitamin C and linoleic acid areassociated with a lower prevalence of a wrinkled appearance,senile dryness, and skin atrophy, whereas higher intakes of fatsand carbohydrates are associated with a higher likelihood offeatures of skin aging. The favorable associations may be attrib-utable to the dietary sources of these nutrients (fruit, vegetables,and nuts) and are independent of factors known to affect skinaging. Perhaps appealing benefits such as reducing skin-agingappearance may motivate healthy eating, and new campaigns topromote healthy dietary behaviors could consider this issue. Ourfindings support current recommendations that promote aspectsof a healthy diet such as higher intakes of fruit, vegetables, andnuts and indicate a new direction for nutrition research in relationto public health.We thank the National Center for Health Statistics for access to the original
