from overexposure to UV radiation often from the sun. Ordinary symptoms of solarerythema include reddish skin, speciﬁcally warm to touch, overall tiredness, hurting, andmild whirl. Sunscreen contains SPF value, which measures how much ultraviolet radiationis needed to cause sunburn on sunscreen-applied skin, which is proportional to thequantity of solar energy needed to cause sunburn on unprotected skin. Between 30 and 50SPF value is sufﬁcient to protect from sunburn, especially for the people who are moresensitive to sunburn. Sunscreen also protects from sun damage including dark spots and
discoloration and helps to keep skin smooth, spotless, and more even. Chemical-basedsunscreen is widely used because it effectively protects the skin from sun damage, but itclogs pores and can be problematic for sensitive skin as it can cause itching or stinging ofthe skin and pus in the hair follicles. On the other hand, herbal sunscreen absorbs lightpreferentially over the range of 280 –320 mm without causing any harm to the skin andeyes. Ayurveda rejuvenates dull skin by regaining the skin’s natural glow and radiance.This review concludes the damaging and harmful effects of UV rays, along with varioustraditional, ayurvedic, and herbal approaches to treat solar erythema naturally.IntroductionThe sun is something that most of us take for granted. Weknow it is a celestial body, governed by the same physical rulesthat control happenings on Earth.1Nowadays, people are
1Nowadays, people arebecoming aware of the fact that excessive solar radiation with-out appropriate protection is harmful; it causes sunburn, skinwrinkling, skin cancer and cataracts. Dermatologist also recog-nized that individuals in the late 20th century are obliged to livein a complicated eco-physiological balance with sunlight.2Sun-burn, also known as solar erythema, is an acute inﬂammatoryskin condition caused by excessive exposure to UV light.Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure can occur from a numberof sources, including arc and phototherapy lamps and sun tan-ning beds.3Most sunburns are classiﬁed as superﬁcial or ﬁrst-degree burns. UVR exposure comes from a certain kind ofsource, such as suntan beds, arcs, and phototherapy lamps,etc. Most sunburns are superﬁcial or ﬁrst-degree burns, whileapproximately one-third of American adults have sunburn eachyear which was reported previously.4The Centers for Disease
4The Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) in the United States indicatesthat only 50 –65% of all adults (18 –29 years) reported at aminimum of one sunburn in the year 2012.5The disease affectsa huge percentage of the population, affecting about 75% ofteenagers and adolescents in the United States and more than50% of the same age range in European northern countries.6–10According to the CDC, more than one-third of adults and nearly70% of children admitted that they had become sunburned inthe previous year.11The UV spectrum that reaches the earth’ssurface on a summer day contains 3.5% UVB and 96.5% UVA.Erythema and sunburn are the most common side effects of
11The UV spectrum that reaches the earth’ssurface on a summer day contains 3.5% UVB and 96.5% UVA.Erythema and sunburn are the most common side effects ofUVB exposure. They have the potential to produce immunosup-pression as well as photo carcinogenesis.12Almost every Caucasian (white-skinned person of Europeanancestry) had solar erythema at some point in his or her lifeand observed the terrible burning sensation exacerbated by anyminor touch. The subsequent skin peeling phase is likewiserecalled as a shameful, but painless, occurrence. Much isknown now about the tissular, cellular, and molecular processesthat occur inside the skin during solar erythema, but this isinsufﬁcient to completely comprehend its mechanism. Nonethe-less, the presented scientiﬁc facts provide a fascinating insightinto the issue as well as helpful information for practical pur-poses.13International Journal of Dermatology 2023, 62, 322–336 ª2022 The International Society of Dermatology.322
Egyptians employed physical sunscreen made of inorganicclays and mineral powders for this purpose, whereas ancientGreeks used a defensive combination of oil and sand for theirskin. In the year 1940, Benjamin Green (USA) created apetroleum-based crimson jelly known as Red-Vet-Pet (red veteri-narian petroleum), which was used by soldiers to shield their skinfrom sunburn during World War II. It was oily and uncomfortableto wear; therefore, it was discontinued during the war. In 1944,the same Benjamin Green (USA) improved his recipe, whichbecame the well-known Coppertone suntan lotion. Franz Greiter
(Swiss) pioneered the idea of the sun protection factor (SPF) in1962 by creating a way to assess the efﬁciency of sunscreen inpreventing sunburn. Albert Kligman (USA) presented the ﬁrst evi-dence in 1969 that sun exposure causes structural damage to theskin that can be distinguished from the natural aging process.Issac Willis (USA) was the ﬁrst to report signiﬁcant ultrastructuralalterations in the skin following UVA radiation in 1977. The ﬁrstUV tanning clinics opened in the United States in 1979. Copper-tone introduced the ﬁrst UVA/UVB sunscreen in 1980. LorraineKligman (USA) was the ﬁrst to advocate for the involvement ofinfrared (IR) radiation (760 –4,000 nm) in premature skin aging in1982. Albert Kligman (USA) pioneered the concept of photoagingin 1986. Some research published in the 1990s revealed themolecular basis of photodamage response. Rachel Haywood(UK) reported in 2006 that visible light (400 –700 nm) also con-
tributes to skin damage through the activation of radical genera-tion. Indoor tanning was related to melanoma in two World HealthOrganization (WHO) reports in 2007 and 2010.14UVB light causes solar erythema. Even when moderate, itcauses epidermal changes, the most common of which is thedevelopment of sunburn cells. The delayed sun erythema,which is typically preceded by thermal erythema, includes theproduction of histamine followed by prostaglandins, althoughthe biochemical alterations are similar to those found in non-speciﬁc inﬂammatory processes. Some amino acids in mem-brane proteins, melanin, and DNA are possible UV targets. Thelatter typically involves the production of pyrimidine dimers. Freeradical initiation may be the main process inside both cell mem-branes, with subsequent lipid modiﬁcation, and the nucleus initi-ating sunburn cell formation. To some extent, free radicalscavengers may prevent such changes.Any type of solar erythema is linked to a transient breakdown
of the skin’s immunological barrier. The delayed harmful conse-quences include accelerated skin aging, an increased risk ofepithelial skin cancer, and malignant melanoma. The practicalconsequence is that sunburns must be avoided and that carefulskin protection is required for those with fair skin. Despite itswidespread occurrence, our understanding of the cellular mech-anisms behind UVR-induced damage remains limited, as arethe therapies available to alleviate the sensory alterations asso-ciated with it. Developing and verifying models to explain thebiological processes involved in sunburn allow us to gain a bet-ter knowledge of pain mechanisms.13MethodologyDuring the period 2015 –2021, several search engines such asPubMed, Google Scholar, and other legitimate sites were inves-tigated, and a total of 1100 citations were found. After removingduplicates, reviewers evaluated 872 abstracts for relevant
searching criteria. Furthermore, 510 references were eliminatedbased on title/articles screening, and 362 papers were screenedout based on solar erythema etiology and therapy possibilities.In all, 290 references fulﬁlled the established criteria for inclu-sion in the full-text evaluation, resulting in the removal of 22publications from the data extraction process. Only 50 refer-ences were found in the full-text reviews. The search procedureis outlined in Figure 1.Pathobiology of solar erythemaSolar erythema symptoms

Someamino acids in membrane proteins, melanin, and DNA are likelyUV targets, with pyrimidine dimer formation being the most com-mon. Free radical initiation might be the main process inside bothcell membranes, followed by lipid modiﬁcation and the nucleus ini-tiating sunburn cell formation. To some extent, free radical scav-engers may be able to avoid such changes.Any type of solar erythema is linked to a transient breakdownof the skin’s immunological barrier. The delayed detrimentalconsequences include accelerated skin aging, an increased riskof epithelial skin cancer, and malignant melanoma.15UVB is pri-
15UVB is pri-marily responsible for sunburn and the production of DNAdimers, which can lead to mutation. UVA causes oxidative pro-cesses that damage DNA, proteins, and lipids as well as beingimmunosuppressive. Recently, visible light and infrared radiation(IR) have been related to oxidative damage, and IR has alsobeen connected to negative heat effects on skin.14Solar erythema mainly includes two mechanistic pathways asfollows (Fig. 3):(i) Melanin production (tanning)(ii) Inﬂammatory markers (edema)(i) Melanin productionWhen human skin is exposed to the sun, DNA and cellular dam-age in keratinocytes increases transcription of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene, which encodes the synthesis andrelease of melanocyte (pigment-producing cell) stimulating hor-mone ( a-MSH). a-MSH binding to the melanocortin 1 receptor(MC1R) on melanocytes in the basal epidermis produces cAMP
via interactions between MC1R and adenylyl cyclase, activatingprotein kinase A and the cAMP-responsive binding element(CREB), and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor(MiTF). By increasing the amounts of tyrosinase and other melaninbiosynthesis enzymes, CREB and Mitf directly stimulate melaninformation. As a result of MSH-MC1R signaling, melanocytes pro-duce more pigment and epidermal keratinocytes accumulate mel-anin. Short-term tans (rapid reactions) are caused by a shift in thedistribution of melanosomes (pigment-containing granules) frommelanocytes to keratinocytes. Long-term suntans are induced byincreased pigmentation in the skin as a result of UV exposure, as aresult of melanin buildup and cell burning. UV-induced pigmenta-tion may also occur via additional signaling pathways, in additionto direct UV effects on melanocytes, and epidermal MSH may playa part in the adaptive pigmentary response.16
16(ii) Inﬂammatory markersUVR exposure produces the production of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS), which causes an imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants, resulting in oxidative stress, whichdamages lipids, proteins, and DNA. Oxidative stress also causesDNA damage, which is exacerbated by the direct DNA damagecaused by UVB. ROS activates transcription factors such as Nrf2,JNK, and NF-kB, which bind to their respective DNA sequences,antioxidant response element (ARE), AP-1 (c-Fos/c-Jun), andNF-kB. The phase II antioxidants and genes involved in cell prolif-eration and the synthesis of pro-inﬂammatory mediators areamong the transcription factors’ downstream targets. Edema and
erythema were produced by inﬂammation, which enhanced ROSproduction. ROS-induced lipid and protein alterations result inaberrant cellular signaling, which may promote carcinogenesis.Furthermore, oxidative stress stimulated the production andrelease of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which destroy col-lagen, a biomarker of skin aging.17Table 1 Pathophysiology on the basis of duration of UVR/sun radiation19Short exposure 1 h exposure 2 h exposure 3 –4 h exposure Longer exposure↑Vitamin D synthesis onthe skin↓Warmth that radiates↓↑Pigmentation of the skin↓Instantaneous pigmentdarkening↓Melanin that has alreadybeen produced is altered↓Whether it fades quickly

Pathophysiology of solar erythemaUVR directly damages DNA, causing inﬂammation, and death inskin cells.18The erythema caused by sunburn inﬂammation iscaused by vasodilation of cutaneous blood vessels (Table 1).When exposed to UVR, pigment darkening occurs immediatelyas a result of melanin modiﬁcation (oxidation, redistribution). Itmight dissipate quickly or last for days. Delayed tanning occursas a result of increased epidermal melanin production and takeslonger to become apparent (24 –72 hours). The skin thickens as aresult of recurrent UVR exposure, largely owing to epidermalhyperplasia and stratum corneum thickening. Exposure to UVRreduces cutaneous cell-mediated immunity, which leads to non-melanoma skin cancer and some infectious diseases.19Ayurvedic, traditional, and herbal approachesfor solar erythemaAyurvedic concepts for solar erythemaPeople with Pitta-type body constitution (Prakriti) are more sus-
ceptible to skin disorders and sunburn, according to Ayurveda.The presence of Pitta in the skin can be increased by beingexposed to sunlight. This further reduces Rasa Dhatu in the skin,which promotes sunburn. Rasa Dhatu is the nourishing ﬂuid thatprovides skin color, tone, and radiance. A sudden decrease ofRasa Dhatu might cause serious skin irritation. Along with this,Vata will be aggravated, resulting in dull, dry, and parched skin. Ifnot addressed, this might result in the hyperpigmentation of theskin, resulting in dark spots. Ayurvedic medicine heals sunburnby balancing the Pitta and Vata dosha.20Ayurvedic management of diseases caused by solarerythema and related problemsIn Ayurveda, Pitta dushti (Bhrajak ,Aalochka ,Pachaka Pittadushti ) is commonly employed in the treatment of sunburn. Avariety of skin diseases can be treated at an early stage usingPanchakarma therapy that is used to prevent or repair Dosha
and Dhatu imbalance. Subsequently, lifestyle changes and dietmodiﬁcation will certainly help to decrease the harmful effects ofsunrays. Ayurveda remedies ( Lepa ,Uplepa, Alepa, Upnaha,Pralepa, etc.) and Panchakarma treatment like Snehana ,Swe-dana ,Vamana ,Virechana , and Raktamokshana can mitigatethe harmful effects of UV rays like Sheetpitta ,Udarda ,Kotha ,Figure 4 Some ayurvedic formulations useful for solar erythemaInternational Journal of Dermatology 2023, 62, 322–336 ª2022 The International Society of Dermatology.Review Natural approach to treat solar erythema Balkrishna et al. 326 13654632, 2023, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijd.16231 by Keio University, Wiley Online Library on [26/09/2024].

Apply it topically on the body torejuvenate the affected skin (Haramekhal /C22a 04:96 –97) (p. 168).22
22Similarly, various Ayurvedic formulations have been used for thetreatment of skin-related ailments (Haramekhal /C22a 05).22Different ayurvedic methods and formulations to treatsolar erythemaSeveral ayurvedic remedies, including sandalwood, aloe vera,tomato, cucumber, lemon, coconut, and others, assist to keep skinglowing and protect against sunburn20(Fig. 4). In the context ofAnulepana, sandalwood treats a burning sensation. A black varietyof Agaru (agarwood) is cold, very sweet, and slightly bitter, whichconfers prosperity (beauty), complexion, and a speciﬁc type ofaroma that gives nourishment to the body.23Ancient traditional methods to avoid solar erythemaSun protection ingredients such as jasmine, lupine, and ricebran were initially used by the Egyptians. Although they did notunderstand the harmful effects of UV radiation on the skin, theydid grasp the concept of tanning.24,25The ancient Greeks uti-lized olive oil for sun protection both on their skin and in their
food. Olive oil contains an SPF of just 7 –8, according to modernscience. Tribes in Papua, New Guinea, utilized a mixture of clayand/or charcoal, or mud from surrounding rivers, to coat theirbody, providing protection from the sun.

utilized mud and leaves to shield themselves from the sun andtea tree oil to soothe sunburn. The Tanami Desert’s Warlpiripeople used to construct shade shelters called malurnpa out ofspinifex or eucalyptus leaves.To protect their skin from the sun, Namibian tribes created“otjize,” a combination of butterfat and ochre. For over 2000 years,and still today, a natural paste called “Thanaka” has been used toprotect against the sun in Myanmar; it is produced from crushedbark and is high in vitamin E. Tannin, a plant-derived tannin, wasutilized in various regions of Europe in the late 1800s. In certainregions of Africa, clay was used to shield skin from the sun, as didthe usage of animal skins draped over the shoulders for protec-tion.25Some Native American tribes utilized Tsuga canadensis ,akind of pine needle that is similarly excellent in healing sunburns.24Factors affecting the efﬁcacy of sun-protective agentThe elements that contribute to the efﬁcacy of sunscreening
agents include SPF and substantivity (the property of maintainingtherapeutic activity even after the vehicle has been removed).11The SPF of a product is used to assess UVB protection, and it istheorized that items with higher SPFs offer better protectionagainst the damaging effects of sunlight than those with lowerSPFs.26SPF is calculated by dividing the amount of UV radiationnecessary to burn the protected skin (with sunscreen) by theamount of UV radiation required to burn the same exposed skin(without sunscreen), all other parameters remaining constant.SPF is calculated using the formula below:where S.P.F. is the Sun Protection Factor and M.E.D.is theMinimal Erythemal Dose .This implies that, when you apply an SPF 50 product to yourskin, it will protect it until it is exposed to 50 times the amountof UVB radiation required to burn unprotected skin.To determine if a product meets regulatory standards, a com-
puter program or software, such as sunscreen simulators, canbe used to calculate the SPF level, efﬁcacy against a wave-length of UV radiation, and UVA/UVB ratio.SPF 15 sunscreen protects against roughly 93.3% of UVradiation, SPF 30 sunscreen protects against approximately96.7% of rays, and SPF 50 +sunscreen protects againstapproximately 98.3% of rays (Fig. 5). There is no SPF that cancompletely protect against UV radiation.27Need for UV protection by sun protecting formula (SPF)Skin damage caused by UV radiation has been recognized for thou-sands of years. Sunscreen, as we know it, has been manufacturedsince the 1940s and has developed through time to protect in variousways.25Photoprotective agents are used for protection against ultra-violet (UV) radiation; now sunscreens are in great demand.Safeguarding UV radiation is measured as a minimum erythemadose—based on sun protection factor (SPF). Sunscreen products
that can absorb, reﬂect, or scatter UV photons are considered to beeffective. Hence, they attenuate the amount and nature of UV radia-tions reaching viable cells in the skin. Various synthetic and naturalagents are available in the market for the purpose of photoprotection.Commonly used sunscreens are topical formulations that have UV ﬁl-ters (UVA or UVB ﬁlters) and antioxidants as major components.28For Indian skin types, lotions and sunblocks of SPF 20 –35 are recom-mended. The sun’s beams are easily inﬂuenced by fair complexion.For persons with a fair and wheatish complexion, lotions with SPF15–50 are found to be suitable. However, SPF 2 –10 is recommendedfor those with a dark complexion (Fig. 6).29Herbal-based products for solar erythemaNatural/herbal sunscreen products have piqued the interest ofresearchers owing to their safety, numerous biological effects onthe skin, and low cost (Fig. 7). Many characteristics of plant phyto-
constituents make them the best component for sunscreen com-positions (Table 2). Plant actives are chosen over artiﬁcial
the skin, and low cost (Fig. 7). Many characteristics of plant phyto-constituents make them the best component for sunscreen com-positions (Table 2). Plant actives are chosen over artiﬁcialsunscreens due to their broad range of UV absorption and preven-tive impact against oxidative stress, inﬂammation, and cancer. Forexample, Phyllanthus emblica (fruits), a Vitamin C-rich herb, is apossible natural antioxidant with free radical scavenging charac-teristics that is useful for ultra-violet and radio-protection, as wellas decreasing oxidative stress in a range of clinical conditions.30Squalene is the most essential protective lipid in the skin. Allantoin,a natural nucleotide, is found in the body which absorbs UV light,causing the fragile DNA of cells to be destroyed. Allantoin is a com-frey plant extract useful for its anti-irritating, anti-inﬂammatory, andhealing properties.31Figure 6 Different skin tones and their recommended SPF values

Most active constituents present in herbal plantseffective for solar erythemaPhotoprotective compounds are highly beneﬁcial for reducingthe harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the skin.Because plant-based sunscreens contain polyphenols such asﬂavonoids and carotenoids, they contain antioxidant compo-nents that protect the skin from the sun. Fruits, including straw-berries, grapefruits, and apples, contain ﬂavonoids. Naturallipophilic pigments, such as b-carotene, lutein, and lycopeneare carotenoids. These chemicals are recognized to be potentialantioxidants, preventing free radicals from damaging variousmolecules, including those found in the skin. The UV protectionfactor of herbal oils used in cosmetics, such as olive, coconut,castor, almond, mustard, chaulmoogra, and sesame, may beevaluated in vitro.43*Images of Chemical Structures Adopted from PubChem.How herbal sunscreen protects skin from harmfulsunrays
sunraysSunscreens work by avoiding and reducing the harmful effects ofUV sunrays after sun exposure. They provide a barrier that pre-vents solar rays from entering the skin, UV radiation scattering,and reﬂection from the skin surface. UV energy is absorbed byconverting it to heat energy, which reduces its damaging effectsand the depth to which it may penetrate44(Fig. 8).Synthetic sunscreens produce reactive oxygen species in thehuman skin, whereas herbal sun-protective agents containing natu-ral antioxidants, such as ﬂavonoids, polyphenols, carotenoids (ly-copene and carotene), and phenolic acids, which have the ability todonate electrons and stop free radical chain reactions, thereby pro-tecting the skin from harmful UV radiation. Herbal sun blockershave no or fewer negative effects than chemical sun blockers andare effective in chronic situations. Herbal products are found beneﬁ-
cial because they do not cause allergic reactions, have no harmfulside effects and are noncomedogenic properties. Herbal elementsare also simple to incorporate within a formula. They are moreeffective, have a greater level of stability, purity, and cost-effectiveness and are found in a variety of plants.45Damaging effects/ravages of modern medicinesystem to treat solar erythemaMarketed chemical products used for solar erythemaThe majority of chemical sunscreens only block a small por-tion of the UV spectrum.

compounds included in sunblocks are active in the UVB area.Only a few compounds are known to inhibit the UVA area.31Organic (carbon-based) chemicals in chemical sunscreen,such as oxybenzone, octinoxate, octisalate, and avobenzone,cause a chemical reaction (Table 3). Chemical sunscreenworks by absorbing UV rays and converting them to heat,which is subsequently released from the skin, increasing thelikelihood of redness in rosacea-prone skin types. As a con-sequence, UV rays do not penetrate the skin. As a result,they are frequently referred to as chemical or organic absor-bers.46Disadvantages of chemical-based sun-protectiveagents481The failure of chemical sunscreens is mostly due to theneed to reapply every 2 hours.2Many people in underdeveloped and impoverished nationscannot afford it.3Chemical sunscreen is costly to use all year, which is whysome individuals do not use it on a regular basis.4There were several discrepancies between the SPF labeled
and the SPF provided after application to the skin and expo-sure to sunlight.Troubles with chemical ingredients present in chemical-based sunscreen49According to the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA),numerous studies have raised new concerns about theendocrine-disrupting effects of three ingredients: homosalate,avobenzone, and oxybenzone. Because of concerns aboutpotential endocrine disruption, the European Commission pub-lished preliminary opinions on the levels of oxybenzone,homosalate, and octocrylene that were not found to be safe inthe amounts that they are currently used and proposed a con-centration limit of 2.2% for oxybenzone and 1.4% for homos-alate.Based on FDA further investigations, the chemicals oxyben-zone, octinoxate, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate, andavobenzone are all systemically absorbed into the body afterone usage and may be identiﬁed on the skin and in the blood,
weeks after no longer being used. Oxybenzone produces aller-gic skin and may be especially harmful to youngsters.Researchers discovered that teenage boys with higher oxyben-zone measures had considerably lower testosterone levels inan analysis of CDC-collected exposure data for American youth.Oxybenzone and similar compounds have been linked to ahigher incidence of endometriosis in females.Figure 7 Ideal characteristics of herbal sunscreen agentsInternational Journal of Dermatology 2023, 62, 322–336 ª2022 The International Society of Dermatology.Review Natural approach to treat solar erythema Balkrishna et al. 330 13654632, 2023, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijd.16231 by Keio University, Wiley Online Library on [26/09/2024].

Four studies published following the FDA’s draft proposal in2020 backup prior results that oxybenzone can serve as anendocrine disruptor and raise the risk of breast cancer andendometriosis. The National Toxicology Program revealedunclear evidence of carcinogenicity in rats, after seeing anincrease in thyroid tumors and uterine hyperplasia in femalesexposed to oxybenzone at high levels.The FDA claims that there is not enough evidence to deter-mine if homosalate is safe and effective in sunscreens. It hasbeen discovered that it penetrates the skin, disrupts hormones,and produces harmful breakdown byproducts in the long run. Incellular investigations, octocrylene has been proven to induce ahigh rate of skin allergies, while avobenzone has been demon-strated to alter the endocrine system and inhibit the effects oftestosterone.Despite some evidence of octocrylene’s endocrine-disruptingpotential, the European Commission recently found that current
use amounts of up to 10% were safe. In addition, the FDA’s2019 recommendation stated that the hazards of aminobenzoicacid, or PABA, and trolamine salicylate compounds outweightheir beneﬁts and recommended that they be classiﬁed as haz-ardous.Table 2 ContinuedS.

Conclusion and future perspectivesThe effects of suberythemal exposure on human skin haveonly been examined by a few researchers. There has beenno research done on this subject or on the effectiveness ofsunscreens to protect against harm caused by cumulativesuberythemal exposure. It compiles and organizes informa-tion on the effects of suberythemal solar-simulated radiationand ultraviolet A on the skin as well as a sunscreen pro-tection.The biological effects of VL, UVR, and IR interactions withvarious types of skin, particularly pigmentation and erythema-induced changes, are inﬂuenced by several factors. UVR spec-tra have different impacts on melanin location and epidermal
structure and thickness. This interaction is inﬂuenced by thelength of exposure, particular chromophores, a dose of eachwavelength, constitutional skin type, and preexposure skin pig-mentation. VL has now been proven to cause erythema andpigmentation in dark-skinned people. IR-induced erythema iswell documented. More research on the cutaneous effects ofVL and IR is needed.There have been no such clinical and preclinical studies doneusing the Indian Traditional Medicine System to date, and aswe all know, solar erythema (sunburn) may become hazardousand damaging to humans in the future as global warming con-tinues to rise. We may continue to develop Indian herbalmedicinal plants that have previously been described in Ayur-veda and Indian traditional systems.Problems overcome during literature reviewMany UVR effects at suberythema levels, primarily UVB, have
never been investigated before. Spectroradiometry, UVR spec-tra, radiometry, skin irradiance and kinds, and mechanistic ele-ments of solar erythema owing to sun exposure become toughto bring out throughout this literature review. Many measuringtechniques with varying sensitivities are used to estimate almostidentical biological resultants, making it difﬁcult to distinguishbetween the different sorts of ﬁndings. Timing is frequently criti-cal to assess during sampling or measurement. There are sev-eral variances in the deﬁnitions of “repeated exposure,”including exposure length and an increase in dosage with expo-sure schedule, which can be daily or alternate days.Acknowledgments
