Wefocus on  Endothelial  Cell  (EC)  and  Smooth  Muscle  Cell  (SMC)  aging  due  to  their  critical  role  in  mediatingthe defective  vascular  phenotype.  We  elaborate  on  two  categories  that  contribute  to  cellular  dysfunction:cell extrinsic  and  intrinsic  factors.  Extrinsic  factors  reﬂect  systemic  or  environmental  changes  whichalter EC  and  SMC  homeostasis  compromising  vascular  function.  Intrinsic  factors  induce  EC  and  SMCtransformation resulting  in  cellular  senescence.  Replenishing  or  rejuvenating  the  aged/dysfunctional
vascular cells  is  critical  to  the  effective  repair  of  the  vasculature.  As  such,  this  review  also  elaborates  onrecent ﬁndings  which  indicate  that  stem  cell  and  gene  therapies  may  restore  the  impaired  vascular  cellfunction, reverse  vascular  aging,  and  prolong  lifespan.© 2017 Published  by  Elsevier  B.V.Contents1.

P.  Mistriotis,  S.T.  Andreadis  /  Ageing  Research  Reviews  37  (2017)  94–116  951.  IntroductionOrganismal  aging  can  be  broadly  deﬁned  as  the  progressivedecline  of  the  proper  functions  of  the  body  leading  to  organismaldeterioration  and,  eventually,  death.  Although  current  understand-ing  of  aging  is  limited,  the  advances  in  medicine  and  the  modernlifestyle  have  led  to  a  dramatic  increase  in  life  expectancy  from∼30  years  in  the  pre-modern  era  to  ∼70–80  years  in  the  presentday  (Roser,  2015 ).  Unfortunately,  this  increase  also  coincides  withthe  emergence  of  age  related  diseases  such  as  atherosclerosis,  can-cer,  Alzheimer’s  and  Parkinson’s  that  alter  homeostasis  and  reducelifespan  and  life  quality.  Therefore,  to  solve  this  complex  puzzle,  itis  necessary  to  identify  a  systematic  approach  that  will  shed  light
on  the  causes  of  aging.  This  will  facilitate  the  discovery  of  strategiesto  delay  or  even  reverse  aging  and  ultimately  prolong  lifespan.Current  theories  suggest  that  aging  is  triggered  by  cell  intrinsicand  cell  extrinsic  changes.  During  cell  intrinsic  changes,  the  cellundergoes  a transformation that  is  caused  by  a)  epigenetic  changes(e.g.  loss  of  heterochromatin),  b)  DNA  damage,  c)  mitochondrialdysfunction (e.g. generation  of  oxidative  stress),  d)  loss  of  proteinhomeostasis  (proteostasis),  e)  telomere  shortening,  and  f)  loss  ofnuclear organization (Lopez-Otin  et  al.,  2013 ).  Interestingly,  theseprocesses  may  be  inter-related,  suggesting  that  cellular  aging  is  notthe result of  a  single  cellular  malfunction  but  rather  a  combinationof  molecular  changes.  Ultimately,  these  molecular  changes  result  incellular  senescence  (synonymous  to  cellular  aging),  which  severely
affects  cell  and  tissue  function.Senescent  cells  exhibit  distinct  attributes:  a)  they  show  limitedgrowth  capacity;  b)  they  express  aging  markers  such  as  SenescentAssociated- /H9252-Galactosidase  (SA-/H9252-Gal),  p21  and  p16;  and  c)  theyhave  a  characteristic  senescent-associated  secretory  phenotype(SASP),  which  is  characterized  by  high  levels  of  Matrix  Metallo-proteinase  (MMPs)  and  proinﬂammatory  cytokines  (van  Deursen,2014 ).  The  importance  of  cellular  senescence  in  the  progressionof  aging  and  age-associated  diseases  has  been  recently  shown  inprogeroid  mouse  models.  Notably,  purging  of  senescent  cells  fromthe  mouse  body  using  a  novel  molecular  strategy  delayed  organ-ismal  aging  and  inhibited  the  progression  of  age-related  diseases(Baker  et  al.,  2008;  Baker  et  al.,  2011 ).  On  the  contrary,  cell  extrin-sic changes  reﬂect  systemic  or  environmental  changes  that  happen
with  aging,  which  subsequently  alter  the  cellular  behavior  andseverely  compromise  proper  tissue  function.  As  it  is  further  dis-cussed  below,  cell  extrinsic  changes  may  lead  to  intrinsic  changesand  vice  versa  further  contributing  to  the  progression  of  cellulardysfunction.In this  review,  we  discuss  recent  studies  regarding  the  intrin-sic  and  extrinsic  changes  that  take  place  during  vascular  aging.  Wefocus  on  Endothelial  Cell  (EC)  and  Smooth  Muscle  Cell  (SMC)  agingsince  ECs  and  SMCs  are  critical  building  blocks  of  blood  vessels  andplay  a  major  role  in  age-induced  vascular  dysfunction.  We  also  elab-orate  on  current  strategies  that  replenish  and  rejuvenate  ECs  andSMCs  through  stem  cell  and  gene  therapies.1.1.  Introduction  to  endothelial  and  smooth  muscle  cellsECs  and  SMCs  are  the  main  cells  types  that  compose  blood

ECs  and  SMCs  are  the  main  cells  types  that  compose  bloodvessels.  ECs  line  the  lumen  of  a  vessel,  have  thromboresistantproperties,  are  selectively  permeable  to  chemicals  and  humoral  fac-tors,  and  provide  a  dynamic  barrier  to  the  cells  circulating  in  theblood.  The  endothelium  also  acts  as  a  mechano-sensor  by  trans-lating  mechanical  forces  exerted  via  the  pulsatile  blood  ﬂow  intobiological  signals  (Chiu  and  Chien,  2011 ).  Lastly,  ECs  have  impor-tant  autocrine  and  paracrine  functions  such  as  secreting  criticalmolecules  that  regulate  vascular  tone,  inﬂammation,  thrombosisand oxidative  stress  (discussed  in  more  detail  below).  Along  theselines,  Nitric  Oxide  (NO)  is  considered  one  of  the  most  importantmolecules  secreted  by  ECs  and  is  highly  affected  by  aging.  NO  isproduced  by  L-arginine  through  enzymatic  action  of  endothelial
NO  Synthase  (eNOS)  along  with  the  cofactor  tetrahydrobiopterinand  regulates  the  arterial  pressure  by  dilating  the  vessels  (Alp  andChannon,  2004 ).  Other  important  vasodilators  include  prostacyclinand  endothelium-derived  hyperpolarizing  factor.  ECs  also  secretevasoconstrictors,  such  as  Endothelin-1  (ET-1),  Angiotensin  II  (AngII)  and  thromboxane  A2.  Tight  regulation  of  the  local  concentra-tion  of  vasoconstrictors  and  vasodilators  determine  the  tone  of  theblood  vessel.On  the  other  hand,  SMCs  compose  the  medial  layer  of  arterialblood  vessels  and  regulate  the  vascular  tone  and  pressure  by  con-tracting  and  relaxing  in  response  to  environmental  signals.  Vascularcontraction  is  mediated  primarily  by  the  increase  of  the  cytosoliclevels  of  Ca2+,  which  binds  to  Calmodulin  and  activates  MyosinLight  Chain  Kinase  (MYLK).  MYLK  phosphorylates  Myosin  Light
Chain  and  allows  Myosin-Actin  interaction  leading  to  force  gen-eration.  Alternatively, myosin light  chain  phosphorylation  can  alsobe  enhanced  by  the  inhibition  of  myosin  phosphatase  through  theaction of Rho  kinase  (Webb,  2003 ).  Additionally,  as  it  will  be  furtherdiscussed  below,  SMCs  participate  in  vascular  remodeling/repair  bymigration, proliferation and  remodeling  of  the  surrounding  extra-cellular  matrix  (ECM)  through  the  secretion  of  ECM  molecules  andMMPs.Adult tissues  also  harbor  SMC-like  cells  such  as  pericytesand  myoﬁbroblasts,  which  are  known  to  have  distinct  func-tions  in-vivo .  In  general,  pericytes  maintain  the  integrity  ofmicrovessels/capillaries  by  wrapping  around  ECs.  Pericytes  are  alsocontractile  and  play  a  major  role  in  regulating  blood  pressure.  How-ever,  in  contrast  to  SMCs,  pericytes  are  in  direct  contact  with  ECs
and  enable  rapid  nutrient  and  oxygen  transfer  to  the  surround-ing  tissues  (Wong  et  al.,  2015 ).  Previous  studies  suggested  thatpericytes  may  also  hold  stem  cell  characteristics.  In  fact,  pericyteswere  shown  to  express  mesenchymal  stem  cell  markers  and  exhibitmulti-lineage  differentiation  capacity  suggesting  that  blood  vesselsthroughout  the  body  may  harbor  a  reservoir  of  stem  cells  that  canbe  recruited  at  the  site  of  injury  to  restore  homeostasis  (Crisan  et  al.,2008 ).  On  the  other  hand,  ﬁbroblasts  that  are  present  in  connectivetissues  differentiate  into  myoﬁbroblasts  in  the  presence  of  appro-priate environmental  signals  (e.g.  following  injury)  and  play  a  keyrole  in  wound  closure,  tissue  remodeling  and  tissue  regeneration(Li  and  Wang,  2011 ).Although  all  SMCs  share  common  markers  such  as  ACTA2,CNN1,  TAGLN,  DES  and  CALD1,  they  also  express  a  unique  set  of
genes  that  may  be  responsible  for  their  distinct  functions  in  their
CNN1,  TAGLN,  DES  and  CALD1,  they  also  express  a  unique  set  ofgenes  that  may  be  responsible  for  their  distinct  functions  in  theirrespective  anatomic  location  (Chi  et  al.,  2007 ).  In  general,  devel-opment  of  the  myogenic  phenotype  is  believed  to  be  orchestratedby  the  critical  transcription  factor,  Serum  Response  Factor  (SRF).SRF  is  known  to  regulate  myogenesis  by  binding  to  CArG  elements(CC(A/T)6GG),  a  highly-conserved  DNA  region  that  is  present  in  thepromoters  of  almost  all  SMC-speciﬁc  genes.  Interestingly,  SRF  isalso  known  to  regulate  the  expression  of  growth  related  genes,  sug-gesting  that  it  might  not  be  speciﬁc  to  muscle  cells.  Studies  shedlight  into  this  paradox  by  recognizing  that  the  selectivity  of  SRFin  promoting  differentiation  along  the  SMC  lineage  results  fromits  association  with  critical  transcription  factors  of  the  myocardin
superfamily  such  as  MYOCD,  MRTF-A  and  MRTF-B  (Du  et  al.,  2004;Wang  et  al.,  2004 ).  Signaling  pathways  that  are  known  to  promoteSRF-dependent  myogenic  gene  transcription  include  the  TGF-beta(Hautmann  et  al.,  1997 ),  cell  adhesion  (Alimperti  et  al.,  2014 )  andfocal  adhesion  pathways  (Orr  et  al.,  2009 ).SMCs  are  also  believed  to  be  plastic,  acquiring  either  syn-thetic  (proliferative)  or  contractile  phenotypes  depending  onenvironmental  signals.  Contractile  SMCs  exhibit  spindle  shapedmorphology, increased  contractile  function  and  reduced  pro-liferation.  Conversely,  synthetic  SMCs  show  “hill  and  valley”
96  P.  Mistriotis,  S.T.  Andreadis  /  Ageing  Research  Reviews  37  (2017)  94–116morphology,  enhanced  proliferation  rates,  increased  extracellularmatrix  synthesis  and  decreased  expression  of  myogenic  markers.The  synthetic  phenotype  is  known  to  be  more  prevalent  dur-ing  development  or  vascular  diseases  (atherosclerosis,  aneurisms,restenosis,  hypertension),  whereas  the  contractile  phenotype  isprevalent  under  homeostatic  conditions  (reviewed  in  (Alexanderand  Owens,  2012 )).  Recent  lineage  tracing  studies  veriﬁed  the  exis-tence  of  phenotypic  switching  in  atherosclerosis  and  demonstratedthat  >80%  of  SMC  derived  cells  in  atherosclerotic  plaques  displayedmarkers  of  stem  cells,  myoﬁbroblasts  and  macrophages  (Shankmanet  al.,  2015 ).  Other  have  proposed  that  the  proliferative  SMC  thatcontributed  to  vessel  remodeling  might  not  have  derived  from  ter-
minally  differentiated  SMC  but  rather  from  tissue  resident  stemcells  (Tang  et  al.,  2012 ).  Regardless,  contractile  SMC  play  criticalrole  in  vascular  function  under  homeostatic  conditions,  while  pro-liferative  SMC  are  critical  for  vascular  remodeling  and  regeneration.1.2. Vascular  agingAging has profound effects  on  the  vasculature.  As  it  will  bedescribed  in  more  detail  below,  aged  blood  vessels  tend  to  be  stifferand  exhibit intimal and  medial  thickening  as  well  as  lumen  dila-tion. The  number  of  SMCs  in  the  medial  layer  decreases  mostly  dueto apoptosis, cellular senescence  is  evident  and  intercellular  com-munication is  compromised.  Thus,  vascular  aging  coincides  withincreased inﬂammation, oxidative  stress  and  the  emergence  or  pro-gression  of  diseases  such  as  hypertension  and  atherosclerosis.Vascular aging −  both  cell  intrinsic  and  cell  extrinsic  changes  −
severely  affects  the  properties  of  ECs  and  SMCs  ultimately  result-ing  in  compromised  vascular  function  and  further  progression  ofvascular  disease  (Fig.  1).1.2.1.  Effect  of  cell  extrinsic  changes  on  EC  and  SMC  mediatedvascular agingMany of  the  functional  changes  that  occur  in  ECs  and  SMCs  dur-ing aging, are  caused  by  systemic  or  environmental  factors  thatalter  homeostasis  and  contribute  to  the  deterioration  of  the  vascu-lature.  These  extrinsic  changes  are  caused  by  diseases  and  changesin  cell–cell  and  cell–matrix  interactions.  In  the  following  section,we  discuss  extrinsic  changes  such  as  (i)  atherosclerosis,  (ii)  hyper-tension,  (iii)  chronic  inﬂammation,  (iv)  vascular  wall  stiffness  and(v)  vascular  cell  communication.i)  AtherosclerosisDuring atherosclerosis,  an  atherosclerotic  plaque  is  developed,which  is  composed  mainly  by  SMCs  and  inﬂammatory  cells.  SMCs
are  known  to  form  the  ﬁbrous  cap  that  surrounds  the  necrotic  corewhere  inﬂammatory  cells  are  located  along  with  intracellular  andextracellular  lipids.  Atherosclerosis  progression  results  in  narrow-ing  of  the  lumen,  whereas  plaque  rupture  may  lead  to  myocardialinfarction  and  stroke.Atherosclerosis  usually  occurs  in  arterial  regions  with  disturbedblood  ﬂow  (e.g.  branches)  where  ECs  exhibit  unique  molecular  andmorphological  characteristics  that  enables  the  development  andprogression  of  the  disease  (Dai  et  al.,  2004 ).  The  atheroprone  ﬂowpromotes  cuboidal  morphology  instead  of  the  typical  aligned  ori-entation  of  ECs  manifested  in  regions  of  laminar  ﬂow  (Dai  et  al.,2004 ).  In  addition,  ECs  are  prone  to  apoptosis  (Tricot  et  al.,  2000 )which  may  contribute  to  the  development  of  thrombosis  (Xu  et  al.,2009 ).  At  the  molecular  level,  the  atheroprone  ﬂow  mediates  a

2009 ).  At  the  molecular  level,  the  atheroprone  ﬂow  mediates  aproinﬂammatory  phenotype  as  evidenced  by  activating  the  nuclearfactor  /H9260B  (NF-/H9260B)  pathway  (Dai  et  al.,  2004 )  and  suppressing  −  bypromoter  methylation  −  expression  of  the  atheroprotective  tran-scription factors  such  as  KLF4  (Jiang  et  al.,  2014 ).  On  the  other  hand,atheroprotective  ﬂow  upregulates  KLF2  in  ECs,  promoting  an  anti-inﬂammatory  and  antithrombotic  phenotype  (Dekker  et  al.,  2006;Parmar  et  al.,  2006 ).One  of  the  hallmarks  of  atherosclerosis  is  phenotypic  switch-ing,  which  is  characterized  by  SMC  proliferation  especially  duringearly  atherogenesis  (Lutgens  et  al.,  1999 ).  Several  factors  presentin  atherosclerotic  lesions  have  been  shown  to  induce  SMC  prolifer-ation  such  as  growth  factors,  oxidized  low-density  lipoprotein  and
homocysteine  (Tsai  et  al.,  1996;  Zettler  et  al.,  2003 ).  In  addition  toproliferation,  atherogenesis  is  associated  with  SMC  migration  frommedia  to  intima,  where  they  deposit  ECM  and  contribute  to  theprogression  of  the  atherosclerotic  lesion.  However,  due  to  the  lackof  migration  markers,  it  is  difﬁcult  to  decouple  the  contributionof  migration  vs.  proliferation  in  atherogenesis.  In  contrast  to  earlyatherogenesis,  human  SMCs  in  advanced  atherosclerotic  plaquesdisplay  low  proliferation  rates  and  increased  cellular  senescencelikely  due  to  impaired  response  to  growth  factors  and  increasedexpression  of  cell  cycle  inhibitors  e.g.  p16  and  p21  (Bennett  et  al.,1995;  Matthews et al.,  2006;  Patel  et  al.,  2001 ).  Senescent  SMCsrelease  pro-inﬂammatory  cytokines  and  MMPs  and  synthesizereduced amounts of  collagen,  thereby  promoting  inﬂammation
and  plaque  rupture  (Gardner  et  al.,  2015 ).  Advanced  atheroscle-rotic plaques are  also  associated  with  apoptosis,  especially  in  thenecrotic  core  and  ﬁbrous  cap  (Bennett  et  al.,  1995;  Geng  andLibby, 1995 ).  Clarke  at  al.,  examined  the  role  of  SMC  apoptosisin  atherosclerosis  by  generating  transgenic  mice  expressing  thehuman  diphtheria  toxin  receptor  (hDTR)  under  the  TAGLN  pro-moter.  Administration  of  diphtheria  toxin  induced  SMC  apoptosisin  ApoE−/−mice  causing  thinning  of  the  ﬁbrous  cap,  reduced  col-lagen  content  and  inﬂammation,  without  affecting  the  plaque  size,which  was  similar  between  hDTR/ApoE−/−and  control  ApoE−/−mice (Clarke  et  al.,  2006 ).  Using  the  same  transgenic  mice,  theauthors  also  found  that  low  doses  of  diphtheria  toxin  for  prolongedtimes  (chronic  apoptosis)  promoted  calciﬁcation,  medial  expansion
and  degradation  of  elastin  ﬁbers  in  atherosclerotic  plaques  (Clarkeet  al.,  2008 ).ii)  HypertensionChronically  elevated  blood  pressure  (above  140/90  mmHg,  withnormal blood  pressure  deﬁned  as  120/80  mmHg)  is  referred  to  ashypertension.  While  the  incidence  of  hypertension  increases  withaging  (Ferreira  et  al.,  2012;  Ong  et  al.,  2007 ),  in  the  majority  ofcases,  the  causes  remain  unknown.  Among  the  main  known  factorsimplicated  in  increased  blood  pressure  during  aging  is  salt  sen-sitivity,  which  is  more  prevalent  among  the  black-hypertensivegroup  (∼70%)  as  compared  to  the  overall  hypertensive  popula-tion  (50%)  (Weinberger,  1996;  Weinberger  and  Fineberg,  1991;Weinberger  et  al.,  1986 ).  Several  factors  have  been  shown  to  reg-ulate  salt  sensitivity-induced  hypertension  including  the  ReninAngiotensin  Aldosterone  System  (RAAS),  the  Endothelin  system,
NO,  oxidative  stress,  the  sympathetic  nervous  system,  the  AtrialNatriuretic  Peptide  and  CYP450-derived  metabolites  of  arachidonic
NO,  oxidative  stress,  the  sympathetic  nervous  system,  the  AtrialNatriuretic  Peptide  and  CYP450-derived  metabolites  of  arachidonicacid  and  hyperinsulinemia  (for  a  detailed  review  see  (Elijovich  et  al.,2016 )).  Among  those,  we  will  speciﬁcally  elaborate  on  RAAS  dueto  the  pronounced  effects  that  these  molecules  exert  on  ECs  andSMCs.Under  normotensive  conditions,  RAAS  is  known  to  regulateblood  pressure  by  controlling  the  body’s  ﬂuid  volume  (Fig.  2A).  Jux-taglomerular  cells  located  in  the  arterioles  of  the  renal  glomerulusrespond  to  signals  (e.g.  low  Na+)  and  produce  Renin.  Subsequently,through  a  series  of  enzymatic  reactions,  Renin  induces  expressionof  Angiotensin  II  (Ang  II)  through  the  action  of  the  AngiotensinConverting  Enzyme.  Activation  of  RAAS  results  into  Na+reabsorp-tion  and  ﬂuid  retention.  Conversely,  high  Na+intake  suppresses
RAAS (Ingert  et  al.,  2002 )  inducing  Na+excretion  (Ingert  et  al.,2002;  Singer  et  al.,  1994 ).  However,  patients  with  salt  sensitiv-

Normotension (A)  vs.  salt-sensitive  hypertension  (B).ity  exhibit  low  urinary  Na+excretion  and  elevated  RAAS  activity(plasma  Renin  activity  and  plasma  Aldosterone  concentration)  inresponse  to  high-salt  diet  (Yatabe  et  al.,  2010 )  (Fig.  2B).  Indeed,Dahl  salt-sensitive  rats  fed  with  high  salt  diet  exhibited  elevatedlevels  of  Ang  II  and  Aldosterone  in  both  heart  and  kidney  (Bayorhet  al.,  2005 ).  Similarly,  administration  of  NaCl  in  Dahl  salt-sensitiverats  increased  the  expression  of  brain  ouabain,  which  increased  AngII.  Ang  II,  in  turn,  induced  the  expression  of  the  alpha(1)  Na+/K+-ATPase  inhibitor  (and  vasoconstrictor)  marinobufagenin  (MBG),thereby  promoting  elevation  of  blood  pressure  (Fedorova  et  al.,
2005 ).  Conversely,  antibody-mediated  inhibition  of  MBG  reducedsalt-sensitive  hypertension  (Fedorova  et  al.,  2002 ).Activation  of  RAAS  also  promote  hypertension  by  directly  affect-ing  EC  and  SMC  function  on  the  vascular  wall.  Ang  II  is  knownto  promote  SMC  contraction,  proliferation,  migration,  as  well  asvascular  inﬂammation,  elastin  degradation  and  ECM  remodeling,thereby  inducing  vascular  wall  thickening  and  arterial  stiffening(Fig.  2B).  To  elicit  its  effects,  Ang  II  upregulates  MFG-E8,  a  cell  adhe-sion  protein  and  a  biomarker  of  arterial  aging  (Fu  et  al.,  2009 ),which  in  turn  promotes  SMC  proliferation  via  alphavbeta5  inte-grins  and  phosphorylation  of  ERK1/2  (Wang  et  al.,  2012 ).  Ang  IIalso  promotes  SMC  migration  and  invasion  by  the  activation  of  pro-teases  such  as  MMP2  and  calpain-1,  as  inhibition  of  either  calpain-1
or  MMPs  blocked  SMC  migration  (Jiang  et  al.,  2008 ).  Ang  II  medi-ated  calpain-1/MMP2  activation  also  induces  ECM  remodeling  bypromoting  elastin  degradation  and  vessel  calciﬁcation  (Jiang  et  al.,2012 ),  as  well  as  collagen  production  through  activation  of  TGF-/H92521(generally  present  in  a  latent  form)  in  the  ECM  of  aged  arteries  (Ford
98  P.  Mistriotis,  S.T.  Andreadis  /  Ageing  Research  Reviews  37  (2017)  94–116et  al.,  1999;  Jiang  et  al.,  2012;  Wang  et  al.,  2006a ).  Alternatively,  AngII  promotes  SMC  invasion  via  MFG-E8,  which  induces  expression  ofthe  proinﬂammatory  protein,  monocyte  chemoattractant  protein−1  (MCP-1).  MCP-1  inhibition  blocks  SMC  invasion,  while  treat-ment  of  SMC  with  MCP-1  increases  their  migratory  capacity  (Fuet  al.,  2009 ).  Finally,  Ang  II  causes  oxidative  stress,  DNA  damage,apoptosis  as  well  as  EC  and  SMC  senescence,  ultimately  leadingto  atherogenesis  and  vessel  aging  (Herbert  et  al.,  2008;  Kuniedaet  al.,  2006;  Li  et  al.,  2014 ).  Further  studies  are  required  to  deci-pher  how  hypertension  promotes  heterogeneous  phenotypes  (e.g.proliferation  and  ECM  synthesis  vs.  DNA  damage  and  senescence).Ang  II  also  mediates  vascular  inﬂammation  via  multiple  path-
ways.  Ang  II  induces  immune  cell  inﬁltration  presumably  due  toelevated  levels  of  VEGF,  which  is  known  to  promote  vascular  per-meability  (Chua  et  al.,  1998;  Kitayama  et  al.,  2006 ).  Moreover,in-vivo,  Ang  II  promotes  mononuclear  cell  adhesion  to  ECs  andinﬁltration  via  P-selectin  within  rat  mesenteric  microcirculation(Alvarez et al.,  2004 ).  Notably,  inhibition  of  the  Angiotensin  type  1receptor  in  spontaneous  hypertensive  rats  reduces  the  productionof the monocyte  chemoattractant  MCP-1  (highly  elevated  in  theserum  of  spontaneous  hypertensive  rats)  and  suppresses  mono-cyte inﬁltration in  aorta  (Dai  et  al.,  2007 ).  More  recently,  Batistaet  al.,  demonstrated  that  Ang  II  mediates  the  upregulation  of  Toll-like Receptor 4  (TLR4)  in  spontaneous  hypertensive  rats.  TLR4is  expressed  in  both  ECs  and  SMCs,  and  is  known  to  initiate  an
inﬂammatory  response.  Interestingly,  inhibition  of  TLR4  in  spon-taneous  hypertensive  rats  reduces  vasoconstriction  and  improvesthe  impaired  vasodilation  in  aortas,  ultimately  reducing  blood  pres-sure.  In  addition,  in-vitro  inhibition  of  TLR4  in  SMCs  isolated  fromspontaneous  hypertensive  rats  reduces  Ang  II-induced  oxidativestress  and  SMC  migration  (De  Batista  et  al.,  2014 ).iii) InﬂammationInﬂammation is  a  characteristic  of  arterial  aging.  Several  knownfactors  contribute  to  the  pro-inﬂammatory  phenotype  of  agedvessels  including,  hypertension,  atherosclerosis,  genetic  diseases(Olive  et  al.,  2010 ),  environmental  factors  (Csiszar  et  al.,  2009 ),DNA  damage  and  vascular  cell  senescence.  Pro-inﬂammatory  sig-nals such  as  Ang  II,  MMPs,  Calpain-1,  MCP-1,  TNF-/H9251,  IL-6,  IL-1/H9252,IFN-/H9253,  ICAM  and  MFG-E8  increase  with  aging  and  age-related  dis-
eases  (Belmin  et  al.,  1995;  Donato  et  al.,  2008;  Lesniewski  et  al.,2011;  Wang  et  al.,  2014 ).  These  pro-inﬂammatory  signals  may  playa  critical  role  not  only  in  attracting  immune  cells  but  also  in  mod-ulating  the  proper  function  of  vascular  cells.  In  particular,  TNF-/H9251has  been  shown  to  impair  EC  dependent  dilation  (Donato  et  al.,2012 ).  Inﬂammatory  signals  may  also  promote  endothelial  leakageand  vascular  permeability  by  activating  the  small  GTPase,  ADP-ribosylation  factor  6  (Zhu  et  al.,  2012 ).  Similarly,  pro-inﬂammatorymolecules  have  a  profound  effect  on  SMC  function.  TNF-/H9251  has  beenshown  to  promote  SMC  proliferation  and  migration  (Davis  et  al.,2012;  Goetze  et  al.,  1999 ).  TNF-/H9251  also  increases  oxidative  stress  inSMCs  (Manea  et  al.,  2008 ),  which  is  known  to  induce  DNA  damage
resulting  in  cellular  senescence  and  apoptosis  (for  more  details  seebelow).The transcription  factor  NF-/H9260B  plays  central  role  in  mediat-
resulting  in  cellular  senescence  and  apoptosis  (for  more  details  seebelow).The transcription  factor  NF-/H9260B  plays  central  role  in  mediat-ing  the  inﬂammatory  response  in  vascular  cells.  Upon  stimulation,IKK/H9252  is  activated  and  in  turn  phosphorylates  I/H9260B-/H9251,  which  enablestranslocation  of  NF/H9260B  to  the  nucleus,  where  it  promotes  transcrip-tion  of  pro-inﬂammatory  cytokines  (Karin  and  Ben-Neriah,  2000 ).In  addition,  NF-/H9260B  triggers  oxidative  stress  by  transcribing  NADPHoxidase,  which  increases  Reactive  Oxygen  Species  (ROS)  (Anratheret  al.,  2006;  Manea  et  al.,  2008 ).  The  importance  of  NF-/H9260B  in  vas-cular  aging  was  demonstrated  using  transgenic  mice  expressingdominant-negative I/H9260B  in  ECs  (under  Tie2  promoter)  which  inhibits
the  function  of  NF-/H9260B.  The  investigators  discovered  that  NF-/H9260B  inhi-bition  suppressed  vascular  senescence  and  oxidative  stress  markersas  well  as  delayed  aging  and  prevented  age-related  insulin  resis-tance  (Hasegawa  et  al.,  2012 ).iv)  Vascular  stiffnessArterial  stiffness  is  considered  as  one  of  the  hallmarks  of  vas-cular  aging  and  aging  related  diseases.  Stiffness  mainly  occurs  incentral  arteries  −  peripheral  arteries  appear  to  be  unaffected  −and  results  in  higher  pulse  pressure  and  pulse  wave  velocity  (thevelocity  that  the  pulsatile  wave  travels).  Eventually,  the  increasedpulsatile  energy  affects  the  smaller  arteries,  especially  those  in  thebrain  and  kidneys  that  exhibit  high  ﬂow  rates  (Mitchell,  2008 ).Several  factors  contribute  to  arterial  stiffness.  One  such  factoris  the  increase  in  the  collagen-to-elastin  ratio.  Elastin  is  responsi-
ble  for  mediating  the  elastic  response  of  blood  vessels  to  pulsatileﬂow.  It  has  an  extremely  long  half-life  (more  than  40  years)  andits  production ceases during  adulthood.  Evidence  of  fragmenta-tion  becomes  apparent  during  aging  owing  to  the  increased  MMPlevels present in  the  aged  vessel  wall  (Wang  and  Lakatta,  2002;Yasmin  et  al.,  2006 ).  On  the  other  hand,  collagen  (also  presentin the vascular  wall)  bears  the  load  during  periods  of  high  bloodpressure.  Collagen  expression  is  increased  in  many  pathologicalconditions associated with  aging  such  as  inﬂammation,  hyper-tension,  and  atherosclerosis  (see  above).  In  addition  to  highercollagen-to-elastin  ratio,  aging  also  enhances  collagen  crosslinkingand  calciﬁcation  (Bruel  and  Oxlund,  1996;  McClelland  et  al.,  2006 ),further  contributing  to  arterial  stiffening.
further  contributing  to  arterial  stiffening.Vascular  stiffness  is  also  associated  with  cellular  stiffness.  Thestiffness  of  both  ECs  and  SMCs  increases  in  stiffer  substrates  (Byﬁeldet  al.,  2009;  Qiu  et  al.,  2010a;  Sehgel  et  al.,  2013 ).  In  fact,  studieshave  shown  that  the  stiffness  of  the  endothelium  is  compara-ble  to  the  stiffness  of  arteries  lacking  the  endothelial  monolayer(Peloquin  et  al.,  2011 ).  Vascular  stiffness  alters  the  proper  func-tion  of  vascular  cells.  The  endothelial  monolayer  appears  morepermeable  as  shown  by  ex-vivo  measurements  of  old  and  youngaortas  (Huynh  et  al.,  2011 )  as  well  as  with  hydrogels  of  variablestiffness  (Huynh  et  al.,  2011;  Krishnan  et  al.,  2011 ).  Vascular  stiff-ness  activates  the  Rho-ROCK  pathway,  which  increases  actomyosincontractility, EC  and  SMC  stiffness  (Byﬁeld  et  al.,  2009;  Qiu  et  al.,
2010a ),  as  well  as  EC  tugging  forces  (Huynh  et  al.,  2011;  Krishnanet  al.,  2011;  Liu  et  al.,  2010b ).  As  such,  inhibition  of  the  Rho-ROCKpathway  by  Y27632  or  siRNA  for  ROCK1  suppresses  EC  perme-ability  (Huynh  et  al.,  2011;  Krishnan  et  al.,  2011 ).  The  increased
pathway  by  Y27632  or  siRNA  for  ROCK1  suppresses  EC  perme-ability  (Huynh  et  al.,  2011;  Krishnan  et  al.,  2011 ).  The  increasedEC  stiffness  and  permeability  during  vascular  aging  also  enhancestrans-endothelial  leukocyte  migration  and  vascular  inﬂammation.The  increased  stiffness  enhances  leukocyte  spreading  and  persis-tent  migration  (Oakes  et  al.,  2009 ),  whereas  the  separation  of  ECsprovides  a  path  for  leukocyte  paracellular  migration  (Huynh  et  al.,2011;  Stroka  and  Aranda-Espinoza,  2011 ).  Lastly,  vascular  stiffnessdecreases  NO  production  in  response  to  shear  stress  (Kohn  et  al.,2015 ).  There  appears  to  be  a  direct  link  between  decreased  NO  andthe  activation  of  the  RHO-ROCK  pathway,  which  decreases  both  theactivity  and  expression  levels  of  eNOS  (Kohn  et  al.,  2015;  Laufs  andLiao,  1998;  Sugimoto  et  al.,  2007 ).v)  Vascular  cell  communication
v)  Vascular  cell  communicationEC-SMC communication  occurs  through  either  paracrine  sig-naling  or  through  myoendothelial  junctions.  A  wide  variety  offactors  are  secreted  by  ECs  and  stimulate  SMC  relaxation  or  contrac-tion.  Relaxing  factors  are:  NO,  the  prostanoid,  prostacylin  (at  highconcentration  it  can  also  stimulate  contraction),  cyclooxygenase-products,  H2O2(it  can  also  promote  SMC  contraction),  CO,  H2S,epoxyeicosatrienoic acids  and  C-type  natriuretic  peptide.  More-over,  contracting  factors  are:  ET-1,  Ang  II  and  the  prostanoid

Interestingly,  aging  increases  the  expression  ofthe  vasoconstrictors  and  decreases  the  expression  of  vasodilatorsresulting  in  impaired  endothelial-dependent  vasodilation.  Specif-ically,  the  expression  of  ET-1,  several  members  of  the  prostanoidsynthase  family  and  prostanoid  receptors  are  elevated  during  aging(Goettsch  et  al.,  2001;  Tang  and  Vanhoutte,  2008 ).  Increased  lev-els  of  Ang  II  induce  the  expression  of  ET-1  by  the  endothelium(Ferri  et  al.,  1999;  Moreau  et  al.,  1997 )  and  decreases  NO  pro-duction  (Shatanawi  et  al.,  2011 ),  while  increased  oxidative  stress(Manea  et  al.,  2008;  van  der  Loo  et  al.,  2000 )  or  EC  senescence(Minamino  et  al.,  2002 )  decrease  NO  bioavailability.  Lastly,  vasodi-lation  in  response  to  prostacyclin  is  also  reduced  with  advanced
age  (Nicholson  et  al.,  2009 ).In  resistance  arteries  (diameter  <500  /H9262m),  ECs  and  SMCs  directlycommunicate  through  myoendothelial  gap  junctions  (MEGJs).MEGJs  are  present  in  holes  (fenestrae)  of  the  internal  elastic  laminaand  are  composed  of  Connexin  proteins  (Cx37,  40,  43)  that  allowelectrical  continuity and SMC  relaxation  via  EC-derived  hyperpo-larization  (rise  of  intracellular  Ca2+)  (Triggle  et  al.,  2012 ).  Notably,the number of  holes  increases  as  the  vessel  diameter  decreases(Sandow  and  Hill,  2000 ).  However,  in  diseases  such  as  pulmonaryhypertension, the frequency  of  fenestrae  is  reduced  (especially  inarteries  with  diameter  >100  /H9262m)  (Aiello  et  al.,  2003 ).  Similarly,aging decreases local  Ca2+concentration  in  ECs  and  the  number  ofholes  present  in  the  internal  elastic  lamina  of  mesenteric  arteries
(Boerman  et  al.,  2016 ).  These  results  suggest  that  defective  EC-SMC  communication  may  contribute  to  the  vascular  dysfunctionassociated  with  aging  and  aging-related  diseases.1.2.2.  Effect  of  cell  intrinsic  changes  on  EC  and  SMC-mediatedvascular  agingVascular aging  is  also  affected  by  intrinsic  changes  that  eventu-ally  lead  to  EC  and  SMC  senescence.  Although  some  of  these  changesare  evident  in  aged  vascular  cells,  they  are  greatly  pronounced  inatherosclerosis,  which  further  highlights  the  close  association  ofaging and  vascular  disease.i.) Telomere attritionTelomeres are  tandem  repeats  of  TTAGGG  that  are  present  atthe  end  of  the  chromosomes,  capping  and  protecting  them  againstdegradation,  recombination  and  fusion.  The  regulation  of  telom-ere  length  is  mediated  through  the  enzyme  telomerase  (complexthat  contains  the  telomerase  RNA  component  (TERC)  and  a  reverse
transcriptase  catalytic  subunit  (TERT)),  together  with  the  proteincomplex  Shelterin,  which  protects  the  chromosome  ends  (de  Lange,2005 ).  Loss  of  telomeres  is  known  to  trigger  DNA  damage  response,which  may  cause  cellular  senescence  (d’Adda  di  Fagagna  et  al.,2003;  Gire  et  al.,  2004 ),  apoptosis  (Karlseder  et  al.,  1999 )  or  inﬂam-mation  (Kang  et  al.,  2015 )  (for  more  details  see  DNA  damagesection).  Conversely,  ectopic  expression  of  the  hTERT  prolongs  cel-lular  life  (Yang  et  al.,  1999 ).Factors  that  are  known  to  reduce  telomere  length  are:  genet-ics  (Codd  et  al.,  2010 ;  Mangino  et  al.,  2009 ),  cell  division  (Changand  Harley,  1995 ),  oxidative  stress  (von  Zglinicki,  2002 ),  inﬂam-mation  (Jurk  et  al.,  2014 ),  RAAS/hypertension  (Fyhrquist  et  al.,2013a;  Vasan  et  al.,  2008 )  and  cholesterol  levels  (Strandberg  et  al.,
2011 ).  Low  telomerase  expression  and  shortened  telomeres  areevident  in  aged  and  atherosclerotic  ECs  and  SMCs  (Aviv  et  al.,
2011 ).  Low  telomerase  expression  and  shortened  telomeres  areevident  in  aged  and  atherosclerotic  ECs  and  SMCs  (Aviv  et  al.,2001;  Chang  and  Harley,  1995;  Matthews  et  al.,  2006;  Ogamiet  al.,  2004 ).  Studies  using  TERC−/−mice  demonstrate  that  telo-merase  loss  induces  hypertension  due  to  an  increased  expressionof  endothelin-converting  enzyme  elevating  plasma  ET-1  (Perez-Rivero et  al.,  2006 ).  However,  telomerase  deﬁcient  mice  fail  todevelop  atherosclerosis  because  of  high  HDL-cholesterol  and  lowLDL-cholesterol  levels,  suggesting  that  these  mice  are  not  suitablemodels  for  studying  atherosclerosis  (Fyhrquist  et  al.,  2013b ).ii.)  Mitochondrial  dysfunctionMitochondria regulate  the  cell’s  metabolic  activity  by  producingadenosine  5-triphosphate  (ATP)  as  well  as  metabolites  crucial  forthe  synthesis  of  nucleotides  and  proteins.  In  addition,  mitochon-
dria  control  intracellular  processes  such  as  cell  proliferation  (Mitraet  al.,  2009 ),  migration  (Wang  et  al.,  2015b ),  apoptosis  (Kroemeret  al.,  2007 ),  immune  response  (Zhou  et  al.,  2011 )  and  gene  expres-sion  (Guantes  et  al.,  2015 ),  suggesting  an  active  role  in  intracellularsignal  transduction.  However,  mitochondria  also  produce  the  vastmajority  of  the  potential  harmful  reactive  oxygen  species  (mtROS)(approximately  90%  of  total  ROS)  through  oxidative  phosphoryla-tion  (Balaban  et  al.,  2005 ).  mtROS  are  O2products  (e.g.  superoxideand  its  derivative  hydrogen  peroxide)  that  are  known  to  targetprimarily  phosphatases due to  the  presence  of  cysteine  in  theircatalytic  domains.  Cysteines  contain  a  thiolate  anion  (S−)  whichcan be oxidized  by  ROS  generating  the  sulfenic  form  (SOH)  and/orthe  irreversible  sulﬁnic  (SO 2H)  or  sulfonic  (SO 3H)  species.  These
post-translational modiﬁcations can  inactivate  the  phosphataseactivity  and  thereby  alter  the  intracellular  signaling  (Finkel,  2012 ).Moreover, mtROS such  as  superoxide,  react  with  NO  to  generateONOO−(modulator  of  cell  signaling  and  cytotoxic),  which  limitsthe  availability  of  NO,  thereby  inducing  endothelial  dysfunction  (El-Remessy  et  al.,  2010 ).  ROS  also  induces  DNA  damage  (Borodkinaet  al.,  2014 )  leading  to  inﬂammation,  cellular  senescence  and  apo-ptosis  (see  DNA  damage  section).  Although  at  low  amounts  ROS  hasbeen  shown  to  be  beneﬁcial  for  cellular  homeostasis  and  adapta-tion  to  stress,  overproduction  of  ROS  leads  to  cellular  damage  anddeath  (Sena  and  Chandel,  2012 ).Evidence  suggests  that  mitochondrial  dysfunction  and  mtROScontribute  to  vascular  aging  (Springo  et  al.,  2015;  Ungvari  et  al.,2007 )  and  the  development  of  vascular  disease  (Oliveira  et  al.,  2005;
Wang  et  al.,  2011 ).  This  is  primarily  attributed  to  three  factors:a)  defective  antioxidant  mechanism;  b)  defective  mitochondrialbiogenesis  and  dynamics;  and  c)  mitochondrial  DNA  (mtDNA)damage.  Speciﬁcally,  aged  and  atherosclerotic  (ApoE−/−)  miceexhibit reduced  levels  of  antioxidants  such  as  Superoxide  Dismu-tase  (SOD1,  SOD2),  Glutathione  Peroxidase  (Gpx3,  Gpx4),  Catalase1and  Glutathione  S-Transferase  Mu  1  (GSTM1)  (Gioscia-Ryan  et  al.,2014;  t  Hoen  et  al.,  2003 ),  while  displaying  high  oxidative  stress.Indeed,  SOD2  deﬁcient  mice  exhibit  an  age  dependent  increase  inmitochondrial  ROS  and  mitochondrial  DNA  damage  along  with  adecline  in  vascular  function  (Wenzel  et  al.,  2008 ).  Similarly,  dele-tion  of  the  antioxidant  Gpx1  increased  the  atherosclerotic  lesion  ofApoE−/−mice  after  24  weeks  on  western  type  diet  (Torzewski  et  al.,2007 ).

ApoE−/−mice  after  24  weeks  on  western  type  diet  (Torzewski  et  al.,2007 ).Mitochondria  are  dynamic  organelles  which  continuouslyexpand  (biogenesis),  merge  (fusion)  or  divide  (ﬁssion).  Thisdynamic  behavior  is  altered  during  vascular  aging  and  disease.ECs  and  SMCs  in  aged  aortas  of  F344  rats  exhibit  reduced  expres-sion  of  biogenesis  markers  such  as  mitochondrial  transcriptionfactor  A  (TFAM)  and  peroxisome  proliferator-activated  receptor-/H9253  coactivator-1  (PGC-1 /H9251)  as  well  as  mitochondrial  content(Ungvari  et  al.,  2008 ).  Deletion  of  PGC-1 /H9251  in  ApoE  deﬁcient  (PGC-1/H9251−/−/ApoE−/−)  mice  accelerated  vascular  aging  while  reducingthe  amounts  of  TERT  and  increasing  the  expression  of  the  senes-cent  marker  p53.  PGC-1 /H9251  deﬁciency  also  increased  atherosclerosisand  oxidative  DNA  damage  (Xiong  et  al.,  2015 ).  Along  these  lines,
Mitofusin  2  (Mfn2 ),  a  protein  that  mediates  mitochondrial  fusion,decreases  during  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (Ryan  et  al.,2013 )  and  atherosclerosis( Chen  et  al.,  2004 ),  while  mitochondrialﬁssion and  Drp1  (ﬁssion  marker)  is  markedly  increased  in  pul-monary  arterial  hypertension  (Marsboom  et  al.,  2012 )  as  well  as
100  P.  Mistriotis,  S.T.  Andreadis  /  Ageing  Research  Reviews  37  (2017)  94–116in  diabetes  induced  atherosclerosis  (Wang  et  al.,  2017 ).  Inhibitionof  mitochondrial  ﬁssion  in  EC  by  Metformin  (antidiabetic  drug)reduced  the  development  of  atherosclerosis  in  diabetic  ApoE  deﬁ-cient  mice.  Metformin  exerts  its  effect  on  mitochondrial  dynamicsby  downregulating  Drp1  through  AMPK  activation  (Wang  et  al.,2017 ).  Increased  mitochondrial  ﬁssion  via  Mfn2  knockdown  orDrp1  activation  is  also  known  to  promote  SMC  proliferation  in  pul-monary  arterial  hypertension  (Marsboom  et  al.,  2012;  Ryan  et  al.,2013 ).  Moreover,  mitochondrial  ﬁssion  regulates  SMC  migration.Inhibition  of  Drp1  reduced  PDGF-induced  SMC  migration  and  ROSproduction  in-  vitro ,  as  well  as  neointima  formation  in-vivo  (Wanget  al.,  2015b ).  Interestingly,  a  recent  study  reported  that  mitochon-
drial  ﬁssion  regulates  arterial  SMC  constriction,  suggesting  thatmitochondrial  dynamics  may  also  play  a  role  in  the  developmentof  hypertension  (Liu  et  al.,  2016 ).  Apart  from  SMCs,  aging  and  vas-cular  diseases  alter  the  mitochondrial  dynamics  in  ECs.  EC  agingdecreases  the  activity  of  both  mitochondrial  fusion  and  ﬁssion(Jendrach et al.,  2005 ).  Decreased  mitochondrial  ﬁssion  is  accom-panied  by  a  decline  in  Drp1  expression  in-vitro  and  in-vivo ,  whileknockdown of Drp1  induces  cellular  senescence  in  young  EC  andimpairs  their  angiogenic  capacity  (Lin  et  al.,  2015 ).In aging (Corral-Debrinski  et  al.,  1992;  Khaidakov  et  al.,  2003;Schwarze  et  al.,  1995 )  and  atherosclerosis( Ballinger  et  al.,  2002;Yu et al.,  2013 ),  mtDNA  damage  is  pronounced  due  to  accumu-lation  of  mutations  and  deletions  (Corral-Debrinski  et  al.,  1992;
Khaidakov  et  al.,  2003;  Schwarze  et  al.,  1995 )  as  well  as  produc-tion  of  ROS  (Ballinger  et  al.,  2002;  Shokolenko  et  al.,  2009 ).  Theseresults  prompted  scientists  to  hypothesize  that  mtDNA  damage-mediated  mitochondrial  dysfunction  may  contribute  to  aging  andthe  development  of  vascular  diseases.  Indeed,  seminal  studies  usingknock-in  mice  carrying  the  proofreading-deﬁcient  version  of  themitochondrial  DNA  polymerase  G  (POLG)  demonstrate  increasedmtDNA  deletions  and  mutations  that  cause  accelerated  aging(hair  loss,  kyphosis,  osteoporosis,  anaemia,  reduced  fertility  andheart  enlargement),  and  reduced  lifespan  (Kujoth  et  al.,  2005;Trifunovic  et  al.,  2004 ).  mtDNA  damage  also  induced  expressionof  apoptotic  markers,  without  increasing  oxidative  stress  or  ROSproduction,  suggesting  a  causal  role  of  mtDNA  in  the  development
of  the  aged  phenotype  (Kujoth  et  al.,  2005 ).  In  agreement,  POLGdeﬁcient atherosclerotic  (POLG−/−ApoE−/−)  mice  exhibit  mtDNAdamage  and  mitochondrial  dysfunction  (defective  oxidative  phos-phorylation)  as  well  as  increased  atherosclerosis  in-vivo.  In-vitro ,SMCs  isolated  from  POLG  deﬁcient  atherosclerotic  mice  exhibitedincreased  SMC  apoptosis,  senescence  and  reduced  proliferation.Notably,  although  atherosclerosis  is  associated  with  elevated  lev-els  of  ROS,  POLG  deﬁcient  atherosclerotic  mice  did  not  exhibitincreased  ROS  production  (Yu  et  al.,  2013 ).iii.) DNA  damageDNA  damage  activates  a  series  of  proteins  that  act  as  sen-sors  and  promote  DNA  repair,  cell  cycle  arrest,  apoptosis,  cellularsenescence,  and  inﬂammation.  Important  in  this  process  arethe  enzymes  ataxia  telangiectasia–mutated  (ATM)  protein  andATM-Rad3-related  (ATR)  that  phosphorylate  H2A  histone  family,
member  X  (/H9253-H2AX)  and  together,  they  accumulate  at  the  site  ofDNA  damage  (Kuo  and  Yang,  2008 ).  ATM  and  ATR  also  activate,
member  X  (/H9253-H2AX)  and  together,  they  accumulate  at  the  site  ofDNA  damage  (Kuo  and  Yang,  2008 ).  ATM  and  ATR  also  activate,either  directly  or  through  Chk1  (checkpoint  kinase-1)  and  Chk2(checkpoint  kinase-2),  the  central  regulator  of  the  DNA  damageresponse,  p53  (Canman  et  al.,  1998;  Guo  et  al.,  2000;  Matsuokaet  al.,  2000;  Shieh  et  al.,  2000 ).  p53  applies  diverse  molecular  mech-anisms  to  control  cell  fate  such  as  cell  cycle  arrest  and  apoptosis  byinducing  the  expression  of  both  pro-and  anti-apoptotic  genes  (Rileyet  al.,  2008 ).  The  expression  level  of  p53  is  critical  in  regulating  itspro- vs.  anti-  apoptotic  role.  Using  a  tetracycline  inducible  system,Kracicova  et  al.,  reported  that  high  p53  levels  promote  apoptosis,whereas  low  levels  induces  growth  arrest  (Kracikova  et  al.,  2013 ).In  addition,  the  association  of  p53  with  different  co-factors  regu-
lates  different  cellular  fates.  For  example,  interaction  of  p53  withASPP1  (apoptosis-stimulating  of  p53  protein  1)  or  ASPP2  inducesapoptosis  and  pro-apoptotic  gene  expression  but  not  growth  arrest(Samuels-Lev  et  al.,  2001 ).  Post-translational  modiﬁcations,  suchas  phosphorylation,  also  regulate  the  dual  role  of  p53.  Chemicalagents  and  stress  phosphorylates  p53  on  Ser  46  inducing  apoptosis,while  blocking  phosphorylation  by  mutating  Ser  46  to  Ala  severelydecreased  the  percentage  of  apoptotic  cells  (Oda  et  al.,  2000 ).In  addition  to  apoptosis,  DNA  damage  is  one  of  the  maindeterminants  of  cellular  senescence.  DNA  damage  response  acti-vates  p53  which  in  turn  up-regulates  the  cyclin-dependent  kinase(CDK)  inhibitor,  p21,  inducing  growth  arrest  (Herbig  et  al.,2004 ).  However,  DNA  damage  can  also  induce  senescence  via  a
p53  independent  pathway.  This  mechanism  includes  the  p16/Rb(Retinoblastoma)  pathway.  Various  DNA  damage  inducing  stim-uli  (e.g. irradiation (Wang  et  al.,  2006b )),  upregulate  p16  whichinhibits  the  kinase  activity  of  CDKs,  thereby  blocking  Rb  phospho-rylation and E2F-mediated  transcription  of  proliferation  relatedgenes  (Serrano  et  al.,  1993 ).  Alternatively,  p16/Rb  in  conjunctionwith mitogenic signals  can  induce  senescence  by  increasing  theproduction  of  ROS  via  PKC/H9254  which  leads  to  downregulation  ofWARTS, an important  kinase  for  cell  division  (Takahashi  et  al.,2006 ).  Notably,  p53  inactivation  fails  to  induce  cell  proliferation  (orreversal  of  the  senescent  phenotype)  in  senescent  cells  with  highexpression  of  p16,  further  suggesting  that  p16/Rb  provide  an  alter-native  mechanism  for  maintaining  cellular  senescence  (Beausejour
et  al.,  2003 ).  However,  crosstalk  exists  between  the  p16/Rb  and  thep53/p21  pathways  since  loss  of  p53  induces  p16  expression  andvice  versa  (Leong  et  al.,  2009;  Zhang  et  al.,  2006 ).Another  common  feature  of  DNA  damage  is  the  generationof  an  inﬂammatory  response  via  the  secretion  of  inﬂammatorycytokines.  This  occurs  only  after  persistent  DNA  damage  (high  doseof  irradiation  which  also  induces  cellular  senescence)  and  requiresATM  and  Chk2  but  not  p53  or  Rb  (Rodier  et  al.,  2009 ).  More  recently,DNA  damage  was  shown  to  induce  an  inﬂammatory  response  bystabilizing  GATA4  via  ATM.  Subsequently,  GATA4  induces  inﬂam-matory  gene  expression  by  activating  NF-/H9260B  via  IL1A  (Interleukin  1alpha) and  TRAF3IP2,  an  E3  ubiquitin  ligase  for  TRAF6  (Kang  et  al.,2015 ).Mounting  evidence  suggest  that  aging  and  atherosclerosis
are  accompanied  by  extensive  DNA  damage  (Botto  et  al.,  2001;Martinet  et  al.,  2002;  Morgan  et  al.,  2013 ).  Atherosclerotic  plaque
are  accompanied  by  extensive  DNA  damage  (Botto  et  al.,  2001;Martinet  et  al.,  2002;  Morgan  et  al.,  2013 ).  Atherosclerotic  plaqueSMCs  exhibit  increased  levels  of  ATM  and  /H9253-H2AX  both  in-vivo  andin-vitro ,  which  is  indicative  of  the  extensive  DNA  damage  takingplace  during  disease  progression  (Mahmoudi  et  al.,  2008 ).  In  agree-ment,  knockout  of  ERCC1,  a  protein  that  plays  critical  role  in  theDNA  repair  process,  induces  premature  aging,  vascular  cell  senes-cence,  vascular  stiffness  and  high  blood  pressure,  as  well  as  reducedvasodilation  due  to  defective  EC  and  SMC  function  (Durik  et  al.,2012 ).iv.)  Epigenetic  changesThe best-characterized  epigenetic  change  results  in  the  addi-tion  of  a  methyl  group  to  the  cytosine  of  promoter  areas  high  inG-C  content,  termed  CpG  islands.  In  general,  extensive  hyperme-
thylation  is  known  to  cause  transcriptional  repression,  whereashypomethylation  typically  results  in  transcriptional  activation(Jaenisch  and  Bird,  2003 ).  Vascular  cell  aging  and  atherosclerosisare  associated  with  epigenetic  changes  ultimately  affecting  geneexpression.  Global  DNA  methylation  analysis  in  atheroscleroticplaques  revealed  extensive  hypomethylation  (Aavik  et  al.,  2015 ).These changes  appear  to  occur  even  before  the  onset  of  atheroscle-rosis  (Lund  et  al.,  2004 ).  Atherosclerotic  plaques  and  senescent
P.  Mistriotis,  S.T.  Andreadis  /  Ageing  Research  Reviews  37  (2017)  94–116  101ECs  and  SMCs  also  exhibit  increased  methylation  of  the  cardio-protective  protein,  estrogen  receptor  (Kim  et  al.,  2007;  Post  et  al.,1999 ).  Others  demonstrated  that  the  monocarboxylate  transporter(MCT)3,  which  regulate  the  transport  of  lactate,  pyruvate,  andketone  bodies  across  the  plasma  membrane,  is  hyper-methylatedand  down-regulated  during  atherosclerosis.  Interestingly,  loss  ofMCT3  stimulated  SMC  proliferation  suggesting  a  role  in  earlyatherogenesis,  where  extensive  SMC  proliferation  is  evident  (Zhuet  al.,  2005 ).v.)  Loss  of  nuclear  organizationThe nuclear  lamina  is  located  inside  the  nuclear  envelope  and  iscomprised  of  intermediate  ﬁlament  proteins  called  Lamins.  Thereare  four  different  types  of  Lamin  proteins  (LMNA,  LMNC,  LMNB1
and  LMNB2),  encoded  by  three  different  genes  (LMNA  gene  encodesfor  both  LMNA  and  LMNC).  Interestingly,  while  LMNC  proteinis  directly transcribed from  the  LMNA  gene  by  alternative  splic-ing,  functional  LMNA  protein  requires  extensive  post-translationalmodiﬁcations such as  farnesylation,  methylation  and  several  pro-teolytic  processing  events  (Rusinol  and  Sinensky,  2006 ).  Laminsplay a critical  role  in  maintaining  nuclear  structure  as  well  asparticipating  in  a  number  of  functions  such  as  chromatin  organi-zation (Scafﬁdi  and  Misteli,  2006 ),  transcription( Lammerding  et  al.,2004 ),  DNA  replication( Moir  et  al.,  2000 )  and  DNA  repair( Gonzalez-Suarez  et  al.,  2011 ).  Notably,  mutations  of  the  LMNA  gene  areassociated  with  a  genetic  disease  (Hutscinson-Gilford  Progeria  Syn-drome,  HGPS)  that  causes  premature  aging  and  displays  a  severe
cardiovascular  phenotype.  The  vascular  effects  of  HGPS  are  verysimilar  to  vascular  aging  and  include  increased  stiffness,  calciﬁ-cation  and  inﬂammation  as  well  as  a  decrease  in  vascular  SMCdensity.  Patients  also  exhibit  premature  atherosclerosis  and  die  ofstroke  or  myocardial  infarction  (Brassard  et  al.,  2015 ).  The  mutatedLMNA  protein  (Progerin)  is  known  to  accumulate  mainly  in  mes-enchymal  derived  cells  probably  due  to  the  increased  expressionof  LMNA  in  these  cells  (Swift  et  al.,  2013 ).  To  elicit  prematureaging,  progerin  induces  epigenetic  changes  (Heyn  et  al.,  2013 ),DNA  damage  (Benson  et  al.,  2010 )  and  oxidative  stress  (Viteriet  al.,  2010 ).  A  recent  study  proposed  that  the  NRF2  antioxidantpathway may  be  one  of  the  main  determinants  of  the  HGPS  pheno-type.  By  applying  a  high-throughput  siRNA  screen,  they  identiﬁed
that  loss  of  CAND1  (cullin-associated  NEDD8-dissociated  protein1,  member  of  cullin-containing  E3  ubiquitin  ligase  complexes)decreased  Progein  levels  with  concomitant  decrease  in  Progerin-induced  DNA  damage.  CAND1  (as  part  of  the  CAND1/cullin3/RBX1complex)  is  known  to  bind  and  degrade  NRF2,  thereby  decreas-ing  the  NRF2-mediated  antioxidant  gene  expression.  On  the  otherhand,  Progerin  induces  NRF2  subnuclear  mislocalization  caus-ing  impaired  NRF2  transcriptional  activity  and  oxidative  stress.Expression  of  constitutive  active  NRF2  in  skin  ﬁbroblasts  derivedfrom  HGPS  reversed  the  progerin-induced  nuclear  defects,  reducedprogerin  protein  levels  and  oxidative  stress,  and  restored  the  pro-tein  levels  of  DNA  damage  and  epigenetic  markers( Kubben  et  al.,2016 )HGPS  SMCs  exhibit  several  features  of  aging  including  decreased
telomere  length,  DNA  damage  and  premature  senescence  (Liu  et  al.,2011a;  Zhang  et  al.,  2014 ).  ECs  of  HGPS  patients  also  carry  the
telomere  length,  DNA  damage  and  premature  senescence  (Liu  et  al.,2011a;  Zhang  et  al.,  2014 ).  ECs  of  HGPS  patients  also  carry  themutated  LMNA  gene  (McClintock  et  al.,  2006 ).  Interestingly,  pro-tease  inhibition  by  Atazanavir  induced  accumulation  of  immaturefarnesylated  pre-LMNA  protein  in  ECs  with  accompanying  nuclearabnormalities,  cellular  senescence,  increased  monocyte  adhesionand  decreased  angiogenic  capacity.  However,  some  of  these  resultsmay  be  attributed  to  other  effects  of  atazanavir,  which  are  unrelatedto  pre-LMNA  accumulation  (Bonello-Palot  et  al.,  2014 ).  Finally,  theimportance of  nuclear  lamins  in  vascular  SMCs  has  also  been  doc-umented  in  normal  aging  as  evidenced  by  the  accumulation  ofpermanently  farnesylated  pre-lamin  A  in  aged  SMCs  in-vivo  causingDNA  damage  and  mitotic  defects  (Ragnauth  et  al.,  2010 ).vi.)  Cellular  Senescence
vi.)  Cellular  SenescenceCell intrinsic  changes  ultimately  lead  to  a  senescent  phenotype.Senescent  vascular  cells  are  evident  in  aged  and  atheroscleroticarteries.  In-vivo  senescent  ECs  and  SMCs  express  the  typical  senes-cent  marker  SA-/H9252-Gal  (Matthews  et  al.,  2006;  Minamino  et  al.,2002;  Ragnauth  et  al.,  2010 ).  SMCs  derived  from  atheroscleroticarteries  exhibit  other  characteristic  features  of  senescence,  suchas  decreased  proliferation,  decreased  expression  of  cyclins  andincreased  expression  of  cell  cycle  inhibitors  p21  and  p16  (Bennettet  al.,  1998;  Matthews  et  al.,  2006;  O’Sullivan  et  al.,  2003 ).  A  recentstudy  demonstrated  that  activation  of  Liver  X  receptors  (LXRs)inhibits  EC  senescence  in-vitro  and  in-vivo ,  which  may  explain  theatheroprotective  role  of  LXR  agonists  (Hayashi  et  al.,  2014;  Josephet  al., 2002 ).
et  al., 2002 ).Senescent  cells  are  known  to  have  a  unique  secretory  phenotypethat affects the  surrounding  tissue  and  alters  homeostasis.  Senes-cent  ECs  and  SMCs  have  been  shown  to  increase  the  expressionof several pro-inﬂammatory  signals  including  IL6  and  IL8  (Gardneret  al.,  2015;  Wu  et  al.,  2015 ).  Senescent  SMCs  also  secrete  activeMMP-9 and produce  less  collagen,  thereby  contributing  to  ves-sel  remodeling  and  atherosclerotic  plaque  destabilization  (Gardneret  al.,  2015 ).  Aged  SMCs  appear  less  contractile  (Wheeler  et  al.,2015 )  while  senescent  ECs  exhibit  decreased  angiogenic  potential,eNOS  activity  and  NO  secretion  (Matsushita  et  al.,  2001;  Minaminoet  al.,  2002;  Sato  et  al.,  1993;  Yang  et  al.,  1999 ).  In  addition,  senes-cent  ECs  upregulate  plasminogen  activator  inhibitor  1  indicating  apro-thrombotic  phenotype  (Comi  et  al.,  1995 ).
1.3.  Cell  and  gene  therapies  for  vascular  regenerationBetter  understanding  of  vascular  aging  and  diseases  will  aid  inthe  development  of  therapeutic  interventions  aiming  at  vascularregeneration.  In  this  section,  we  will  provide  evidence  that  novelcell  and  gene  therapies  may  delay  or  even  reverse  vascular  agingand  diseases.  Speciﬁcally,  we  will  focus  on  stem  cell  therapies,  andgene therapies  aiming  at  restoring  the  pronounced  cell  intrinsicchanges  that  are  evident  during  vascular  aging  and  disease  (Table  1).1.3.1.  Targeting  cell  intrinsic  changes  for  vascular  regenerationi.) TelomeresTelomeres  is  a  promising  target  for  vascular  regeneration.  In  fact,delivery  of  the  mouse  TERT  via  adenovirus  increased  lifespan.  Theeffect  was  more  pronounced  when  TERT  was  delivered  in  1-year-old  as  opposed  to  2-year-old  mice.  To  elicit  its  effect,  TERT  required
an  active  catalytic  domain.  Notably,  TERT  expression  in  aged  micedid  not  increase  cancer,  suggesting  that  telomerase  gene  therapy
an  active  catalytic  domain.  Notably,  TERT  expression  in  aged  micedid  not  increase  cancer,  suggesting  that  telomerase  gene  therapymay  provide  a  novel  method  to  increase  lifespan  (Bernardes  deJesus  et  al.,  2012 ).  Moreover,  ectopic  expression  of  hTERT  prolongedlifespan  of  both  normal  and  atherosclerotic  SMCs  (Matthews  et  al.,2006 ),  and  expression  of  TRF2  (part  of  the  Shelterin  protein  com-plex  that  protects  telomeres)  under  the  TAGLN  promoter  in  ApoEdeﬁcient  mice  was  sufﬁcient  to  protect  vessels  from  atherosclerosisby  increasing  the  ﬁbrous  cap  and  decreasing  the  necrotic  core  area.TRF2  mediated  its  effects,  by  inhibiting  senescence  and  enhancingDNA  repair.  (Wang  et  al.,  2015a ).  Conversely,  inhibition  of  TERT  in  amodel  of  guidewire-induced  arterial  injury  reduced  neointima  for-mation  by  reducing  SMC  proliferation  via  silencing  of  E2F1  (Endorf
et  al.,  2017 ).  Along  these  lines,  ApoE  deﬁcient  mice  lacking  TERC(ApoE−/−TERC−/−)  exhibited  diminished  atherosclerosis  as  com-pared  to  ApoE−/−mice,  possibly  due  to  signiﬁcant  inhibition  of

Andreadis  /  Ageing  Research  Reviews  37  (2017)  94–116immune  cell  (lymphocytes,  macrophages)  proliferation,  which  isknown  to  contribute  to  the  progression  of  the  disease  (Poch  et  al.,2004 ).ii.) MitochondriaTargeting mitochondrial  dysfunction  is  critical  towards  an  effec-tive  therapy  against  vascular  aging.  Although,  antioxidants  are  theﬁrst  line  of  defense  against  ROS,  their  efﬁcacy  in  prolonging  lifespan  has  been  questioned.  Speciﬁcally,  overexpression  of  SOD1,catalase,  SOD2,  or  Gpx4,  failed  to  extend  the  murine  life  (Perezet  al.,  2009 ).  Similarly,  clinical  results  of  generic  anti-oxidants  (Vita-min  A,  C,  E,  selenium)  have  been  disappointing  (Bjelakovic  et  al.,2007 ).  In  contrast,  mitochondrial  overexpression  of  catalase  inmice,  as  opposed  to  overexpression  in  the  nucleus  and  peroxisome,
increased  median  life  span  (∼  5months),  and  reduced  oxidativestress  and damage (Schriner  et  al.,  2005 ).  These  results  suggest,that  targeting  of  mtROS  may  lead  to  the  development  of  noveltherapeutics. Indeed, studies  have  demonstrated  that  mitoQ,  anantioxidant  that  targets  mitochondria,  has  shown  promising  resultsin preclinical models  (Gioscia-Ryan  et  al.,  2014;  Mercer  et  al.,  2012;Miquel  et  al.,  2014 )  and  clinically  against  liver  disease  (Gane  et  al.,2010 ).In  contrast  to  organismal  aging,  overexpression  of  antioxidantsin  the  vasculature  protects  against  the  development  of  vasculardiseases.  Transgenic  mice  expressing  catalase  in  SMC  (driven  bymyosin  heavy  chain- /H9251  promoter)  decreased  aortic  dilatation  inan  abdominal  aortic  aneurysm  model.  This  was  attributed  to  thereduction  of  MMP  activity,  apoptosis  and  inﬂammation.  Interest-
ingly,  no  effect  was  observed  in  total  aortic  H2O2levels  althoughtotal  oxidative  damage  decreased  (as  measured  by  4-hydroxy-2-nonenal  (HNE))  upon  catalase  expression  (Parastatidis  et  al.,  2013 ).Transgenic  mice  expressing  mitochondrial  catalase  also  displayedreduced  pulmonary  hypertension  in  response  to  hypoxia.  However,this  was  not  the  case  for  transgenic  mice  expressing  SOD2,  whichexacerbated  hypoxia  induced  pulmonary  hypertension  (Adesinaet  al.,  2015 ).  Similarly,  transgenic  mice  expressing  catalase  butnot  SOD1  displayed  reduced  atherosclerotic  lesions  (Yang  et  al.,2004 ).  Collectively,  these  results  suggest  that  antioxidant  therapiesrequire  consideration  of  the  type  and  the  subcellular  localization  ofthe  targeted  antioxidant  enzyme.In  addition  to  antioxidant  treatments,  enhancing  mitochon-drial  fusion  has  been  reported  to  be  advantageous  towards  the
development  of  therapies  against  vascular  diseases.  Speciﬁcally,overexpression  of  MFN2  blocks  SMC  proliferation  and  reducesatherogenesis  in  rabbits  (Guo  et  al.,  2007 ),  neointimal  hyperplasiain  a  rat  carotid  artery  balloon  injury  model  (Chen  et  al.,  2004;  Zhouet  al.,  2010 )  and  pulmonary  hypertension  (Ryan  et  al.,  2013 ).  MFN2anti-proliferative  effects  are  mediated  by  upregulating  p21,  p27and  reducing  phosphorylation  of  Rb  without  inducing  apoptosis(Chen  et  al.,  2004 ).Mitochondrial  function  is  also  regulated  via  a  family  of  NAD+-dependent  protein  deacetylases  named  Sirtuins.  There  are  sevenmembers  in  the  Sirtuin  family  (Sirt1-7).  Although  Sirtuins  havedifferent  subcellular  localizations,  Sirt3,4,5  are  localized  in  mito-chondria.  Sirt1  regulates  mitochondrial  biogenesis  by  physicallyinteracting  and  deacetylating  PGC-1 /H9251,  and  decreasing  its  transcrip-
tional  activity  (Nemoto  et  al.,  2005 ).  Sirt3  reduces  oxidative  stress
interacting  and  deacetylating  PGC-1 /H9251,  and  decreasing  its  transcrip-tional  activity  (Nemoto  et  al.,  2005 ).  Sirt3  reduces  oxidative  stressand  intracellular  ROS  in  cardiomyocytes  by  inducing  expression  ofantioxidant  enzymes,  such  as  SOD2  and  catalase  via  activation  ofthe  transcription  factor  forkhead  box  (Foxo3a)  (Sundaresan  et  al.,2009 ).  Alternatively,  Sirt3  also  deacetylates  SOD2  on  two  lysineresidues  enhancing  its  antioxidant  activity  (Qiu  et  al.,  2010b ).  Inaddition, Sirt3  regulates  lipid  metabolism  by  deacetylating  andenhancing  the  enzymatic  activity  of  long-chain  acyl  coenzyme  Adehydrogenase,  which  controls  the  oxidation  of  long-chain  fatty-acids  (Hirschey  et  al.,  2010 ).Given  the  important  role  in  mitochondrial  function,  it  is  per-haps  expected  that  Sirtuins  play  important  roles  in  vascular  aging
and  diseases.  For  example,  EC  speciﬁc  (under  the  promoter  of  VE-Cadherin)  Sirt1  overexpression  in  ApoE  deﬁcient  mice  reduced  theatherosclerotic  lesions  by  enhancing  the  endothelium-dependentdilatation.  In-vitro ,  overexpression  of  Sirt1  in  human  umbilical  veinECs  inhibited  oxidized  low-density  lipoprotein-induced  apopto-sis  (Zhang  et  al.,  2008 )  and  reversed  H2O2induced  senescence(Ota  et  al.,  2007 ).  SMC  speciﬁc  Sirt1  overexpression  decreasedneointima  formation  after  carotid  artery  ligation  or  carotid  arterywire  injury  due  to  the  pronounced  inhibition  of  cell  proliferation,migration  and  MMP9  expression  (Li  et  al.,  2011 ).  Moreover,  SMCspeciﬁc  inactivation  of  Sirt1  increased  DNA  damage  response,  apo-ptosis,  atherosclerosis  and  media  degeneration  in-vivo ,  and  inducessenescence  in-vitro  (Gorenne  et  al.,  2013 ).  Along  these  lines,  Sirt3
deﬁcient  mice exhibited increased  pulmonary  arterial  hyperten-sion  due  to  mitochondria  dysfunction  and  activation  of  proliferativeand anti-apoptotic transcription  factors  (STAT3,  HIF1/H9251,  NFATc2),ultimately  increasing  SMC  proliferation  and  subsequently  vascu-lar remodeling. Sirt3  was  reduced  in  monocrotaline  (MCT)-inducedpulmonary  arterial  hypertension  rat  model  and  adenoviral  expres-sion of Sirt3  in  human  SMCs  derived  from  idiopathic  pulmonaryarterial  hypertension  patient  suppressed  proliferation,  nuclearSTAT3,  HIF1/H9251,  and  NFATc2  and  increased  apoptosis  (Paulin  et  al.,2014 ).iii.) DNA  damageDNA damage  is  very  prominent  during  vascular  aging  andatherosclerosis  and  therefore  promoting  DNA  repair  may  regener-ate the  vasculature  and  interfere  with  the  progression  of  vasculardiseases.  Along  these  lines  Gray  et  al.,  hypothesized  that  expression
of  the  DNA  repair  gene  Nibrin  (NSB1)  may  inhibit  atherosclero-sis.  They  developed  transgenic  mice  expressing  NSB1  under  theTAGLN  promoter,  and  crossed  them  with  ApoE  deﬁcient  mice.They  reported,  that  although  NSB1  did  not  affect  the  genera-tion  of  atherosclerosis  (atherogenesis),  it  increased  the  ﬁbrouscap  area  and  induced  higher  percentage  of  ACTA2+,  which  wasindicative  of  plaque  stabilization.  These  results  were  corroboratedwith  in  vitro  ﬁndings  demonstrating  that  NSB1  increased  DNArepair  and  decreased  growth  arrest  and  apoptosis  in  responseto  the  pro-oxidant,  tert-Butyl  hydroperoxide  (Gray  et  al.,  2015 ).Thus,  enhancing  DNA  repair  may  provide  a  novel  way  to  stabilizeatherosclerotic  plaques.iv.) Nuclear  abnormalitiesDevelopment of  gene  therapies  against  nuclear  abnormalitiesmay  lead  to  treatment  of  progeroid  disorders.  To  this  end,  Osorio
et  al.,  developed  an  antisense  strategy  by  co-delivering  two  25-nucleotides  (also  known  as  morpholinos  that  bind  pre-mRNA  and
et  al.,  developed  an  antisense  strategy  by  co-delivering  two  25-nucleotides  (also  known  as  morpholinos  that  bind  pre-mRNA  andalter  its  splicing)  to  reduce  the  expression  of  Progerin  and  restorenuclear  morphology.  To  enhance  in-vivo  delivery,  the  oligonu-cleotides  were  linked  covalently  with  an  octa-guanidine  dendrimerleading  to  signiﬁcantly  decreased  expression  of  progerin  in  theheart,  kidney  and  liver  of  LMNAG609G/G609Galbeit  not  muscle,  pre-sumably  due  to  low  morpholino  uptake  in  that  tissue.  Notably,morpholino  delivery  resulted  in  signiﬁcantly  prolonged  life  span,from  111  to  150  days  but  there  was  no  evidence  of  vascular  regener-ation  and  therefore  it  is  unclear  whether  this  strategy  can  be  appliedto  restore  the  vascular  defects  of  progeroid  disorders  (Osorio  et  al.,2011 ).
P.  Mistriotis,  S.T.  Andreadis  /  Ageing  Research  Reviews  37  (2017)  94–116  105v.)  Cellular  senescenceRecent studies  suggested  that  removal  of  senescent  cells  mayregenerate  the  aged  vasculature.  Speciﬁcally,  Childs  et  al.  demon-strated  a direct contribution  of  senescent  cells  to  the  pathogenesisof  atherosclerosis by employing a  combination  of  transgenic  andpharmacological  approaches  to kill senescent  cells.  The  resultsshowed  that  atherosclerotic  plaques  contain  three  main  senescentcell  types:  ECs,  SMCs  and  macrophages.  Senescent  macrophagesappear  as early as nine  days  after  the  onset  of  high  fat  diets  inlipoprotein  receptor–deﬁcient  (Ldlr−/−)  mice  and  contribute  toatherogenesis  by  secreting  MMPs  and  inﬂammatory  cytokines.Removal  of senescent cells  (p16+  cells)  decreased  the  number  andsize  of atherosclerotic  plaques  and  reduced  degradation  of  elas-
tic  ﬁbers.  These  results  were  further  veriﬁed  by  the  senolytic  drugABT263,  which  selectively  eliminates  senescent  cells.  Similarly,removal  of  senescent  cells  at  the  late  stages  of  atherosclerosisincreased  ﬁbrous  cap  thickness,  collagen  content  and  inhibitedelastic  ﬁber  degradation  (Childs  et  al.,  2016 ).  Along  these  lines,the combination  of  two  senolytic  drugs,  dasatinib  and  quercetineliminated senescent  cells  in  the  aortas  of  aged  mice,  reduced  DNAdamage and  enhanced  vasomotor  function,  albeit  not  arterial  com-pliance  (Roos  et  al.,  2016 ).  Collectively,  these  studies  provide  directevidence  that  elimination  of  senescent  cells  inhibits  the  progres-sion  of  vascular  aging  and  the  development  of  vascular  diseases.1.3.2. Adult stem cellsCellular  therapies  may  play  an  important  role  in  vascular  regen-eration. To this  end,  the  cells  that  will  be  used  need  to  have  certain
properties:  a)  increased  proliferative  (also  resistance  to  cellularsenescence) and differentiation  capacity  that  is  necessary  so  thatthe  cells  can  rapidly  respond  to  injury,  and  restore  the  loss  of  vascu-lar  cell  function  that  is  evident  during  aging  or  disease;  b)  increasedcapacity  for  extracellular  matrix  deposition  (Collagen  and  Elastin)that  is  required  to  stabilize  the  atherosclerotic  plaque  and  reducevascular  stiffness;  and  c)  increased  immunosuppressive  propertiesthat  will  greatly  decrease  vascular  inﬂammation.Stem  cells,  adult  or  embryonic,  demonstrate  increased  prolifera-tion and broad  differentiation  capacity,  which  makes  them  suitablefor  tissue  regeneration.  Although  embryonic  stem  cells  have  beendifferentiated  into  vascular  cells  (Huang  et  al.,  2006;  Kono  et  al.,2006;  Levenberg  et  al.,  2002;  Yamashita  et  al.,  2000 ),  ethical  rea-
sons, along  with  their  immunogenic  and  possibly  tumorigenicpotential  prohibit  their  clinical  use  at  this  time.  In  addition,  exten-sive  work  and  resources  have  gone  into  developing  strategiesto  efﬁciently  reprogram  adult  cells  into  the  embryonic  state  inorder  to  derive  autologous  pluripotent  stem  cells.  Although  stud-ies  have  reported  safe  methods  of  induced  Pluripotent  Stem  Cell(iPSC)  derivation  (Kim  et  al.,  2009;  Zhou  et  al.,  2009 ),  iPSCs  sufferfrom  several  problems  that  prevent  their  current  use  in  regen-erative  medicine  including  (i)  low  reprogramming  efﬁciency,  (ii)use  of  viral  vectors  for  reprogramming,  (iii)  accumulation  of  sub-chromosomal  aberrations  in  the  form  of  copy  number  variations(Laurent  et  al.,  2011 )  and  a  number  of  point  mutations  (on  aver-age  ﬁve),  in  protein  coding  regions  (Gore  et  al.,  2011 )  and  (iv)
oncogenic  potential.  In  contrast,  adult  stem  cells  have  been  suc-
age  ﬁve),  in  protein  coding  regions  (Gore  et  al.,  2011 )  and  (iv)oncogenic  potential.  In  contrast,  adult  stem  cells  have  been  suc-cessfully used  clinically  as  seen  in  numerous  reports  (Janssenset  al.,  2006;  Kovacic  et  al.,  2005;  Leistner  et  al.,  2011;  Quartoet  al.,  2001;  Schachinger  et  al.,  2004 ).  They  have  wide  differ-entiation  potential  and  can  be  autologous  overcoming  possibleimmune  rejection  of  the  graft.  Speciﬁcally,  replenishment  of  ECsand SMCs  may  occur  by  two  main  adult  stem  cell  populations:Endothelial  Progenitor  Cells  (EPCs)  and  Mesenchymal  Stem  Cells(MSCs).i.)  Endothelial  Progenitor  CellsEPCs were  ﬁrst  identiﬁed  in  circulation  by  Ashara  et  al.,  in  1997by  applying  magnetic  bead  selection  for  the  cell  surface  mark-ers  VEGFR2  or  CD34.  These  cells  were  effectively  differentiatedtowards  the  EC  phenotype  and  contributed  to  new  vessel  forma-
tion  (Asahara  et  al.,  1997 ).  Since  then  several  EPC  populations  havebeen  identiﬁed  using  a  panel  of  markers  such  as  CD34,  VEGFR2,CD133,  CD31,  CD146,  vWF,  eNOS,  E-Selectin,  C-Kit,  CXCR4  andUEA-I  (reviewed  in  (Balistreri  et  al.,  2015 )).  EPC  have  been  iden-tiﬁed  in  multiple  tissues  (apart  from  the  circulation),  includingbone  marrow  and  blood  vessels  (Bearzi  et  al.,  2009;  Fang  et  al.,2012;  Ingram  et  al.,  2005;  Ingram  et  al.,  2004;  Lin  et  al.,  2000;Liu  et  al.,  2007;  Tavian  et  al.,  2005 ).  Although  evidence  suggeststhat  circulating  EPCs  replace  the  damaged  endothelium  (Hu  et  al.,2003 ),  it  is  still  unclear  whether  they  also  contribute  to  angio-genesis  (Asahara  et  al.,  1999;  Hu  et  al.,  2003;  Takahashi  et  al.,1999 ). Recent studies  have  demonstrated  that  the  contribution  ofcirculating  EPCs  to  new  vessels  is  extremely  rare  suggesting  that
angiogenesis may occur  through  activation  of  tissue  resident  stemcells  (Purhonen  et  al.,  2008;  Rinkevich  et  al.,  2011 ).  In  fact,  a  novelstem cell population  was  identiﬁed  in  the  blood  vessel  endothe-lium  as  C-Kit  +  lin−CD31  +  CD105  +  Sca1  +  CD117+  cells.  These  cellswere found to  be  highly  proliferative,  and  capable  of  clonal  expan-sion  and  generation  of  functional  blood  vessels  in-vivo  (Fang  et  al.,2012 ).EPCs  have  been  successfully  applied  to  regenerate  the  dam-aged  tissue  as  shown  in  numerous  studies.  Transplantation  of  EPCsinto  diabetic  mice  restored  blood  ﬂow  in  a  model  of  hindlimpischemia  (Schatteman  et  al.,  2000 ).  Transplantation  of  G-CSF-mobilized  CD34+  cells  (containing  EPC)  induced  angiogenesis  andimproved  the  myocardial  function  post  infarction  in  a  rat  animalmodel  (Kocher  et  al.,  2001 ).  Similar  results  were  also  obtained  in
a  swine  model  of  myocardial  infarction  following  transplantationof  autologous  CD31+  mononuclear  cells  (Kawamoto  et  al.,  2003 ).  Inaddition,  bone  marrow  derived  EPCs  have  been  successfully  seededto  the  lumen  of  tissue  engineered  blood  vessels  and  maintainedthem  patent  for  ﬁve  weeks  post  implantation  into  the  jugular  veinsof  lambs  (Liu  et  al.,  2007 ).  Finally,  EPCs  have  been  applied  to  treatatherosclerosis as  well  as  pulmonary  hypertension  (Ma  et  al.,  2009;Rauscher  et  al.,  2003;  Zhao  et  al.,  2005 ).  Due  to  the  promising  pre-clinical  results,  EPC  have  also  been  studied  in  clinical  settings  withbeneﬁcial  results  for  patients  (Assmus  et  al.,  2002;  Leistner  et  al.,2011;  Schachinger  et  al.,  2004;  Strauer  et  al.,  2002 ).Functional  ECs  can  also  be  derived  from  other  cell  populations(in  addition  to  EPC)  such  as  circulating  CD14+monocytes  (Kuwana
Functional  ECs  can  also  be  derived  from  other  cell  populations(in  addition  to  EPC)  such  as  circulating  CD14+monocytes  (Kuwanaet  al.,  2006 )  or  reprograming  of  amniotic  cells  (Ginsberg  et  al.,2012 )  and  ﬁbroblasts  (Han  et  al.,  2014;  Lalit  et  al.,  2016;  Li  et  al.,2013 )  through  signaling  molecules  or  ectopic  expression  of  lineage-speciﬁc  transcription  factors.  Although  these  studies  provide  novelmethods  for  generating  functional  ECs  in-vitro ,  further  studies  arerequired  to  uncover  their  endothelial  regenerative  capacity  duringaging  or  vascular  disease.ii.) Mesenchymal  Stem  Cells  (MSC)MSCs  are  an  autologous  cell  source  for  vascular  regeneration.MSCs  are  multipotent,  highly  proliferative  stem  cells  that  have  beenisolated  from  almost  every  adult  tissue.  MSCs  can  effectively  differ-entiate  along  the  SMC  lineage  in-vitro  (Bajpai  et  al.,  2012;  Gong
and  Niklason,  2008;  Liu  et  al.,  2008;  Liu  et  al.,  2010a;  Nincheriet  al.,  2009 )  and  studies  have  shown  that  MSCs  can  even  give  riseto  vascular  SMCs  in-vivo  (Hu  et  al.,  2004;  Kramann  et  al.,  2016;Tang  and  Vanhoutte,  2008 ).  In  particular,  MSCs  reside  in  the  vas-cular wall,  both  in  the  media  and  adventitia.  Stem  cells  derivedfrom  the  tunica  media  can  differentiate  into  vascular  SMCs,  respond
106  P.  Mistriotis,  S.T.  Andreadis  /  Ageing  Research  Reviews  37  (2017)  94–116to  vascular  injury  and  contribute  to  blood  vessel  remodeling  andrepair  (Tang  et  al.,  2012 ).  Similarly,  adventitia-derived  Gli1+  MSCscan  form  SMCs,  participate  in  vessel  repair  following  arterial  injuryand  migrate  in  the  media  during  aging  and  atherosclerosis.  How-ever,  these  cells  also  differentiate  into  osteoblasts  during  mediaand  intima  calciﬁcation  in  chronic  kidney  disease,  which  is  anundesired  effect  that  needs  to  be  considered  during  MSC  delivery(Kramann  et  al.,  2016 ).  One  group  reported  that  even  BM-derivedSMCs  contribute  to  arterial  remodeling/repair  (Sata  et  al.,  2002 )but  this  notion  was  challenged  by  others  who  reported  that  vas-cular  remodeling  occurs  only  from  wall  derived  SMCs  and  notfrom  circulating  cells  (Bentzon  et  al.,  2006 ).  In  addition,  stud-
ies  have  shown  that  MSCs  have  enhanced  extracellular  matrixremodeling  capacity.  We  have  previously  reported  that  as  com-pared  to  SMCs,  MSCs  exhibited  increased  synthesis  of  collagenand  elastin  in-vitro  and  especially  after  implantation  in-vivo  (Hanet  al.,  2010;  Liu  et  al.,  2007 ),  whereas  others  reported  that  theyalso  exhibited decreased MMP  activity  (Lozito  and  Tuan,  2011 ).Finally,  MSCs  have  an  important  paracrine  role  by  secreting  criticalanti-inﬂammatory cytokines (IDO,  NO,  PGE2,  TSG6,  TGFbeta)  thatsuppress  T-cell  proliferation  and  induce  differentiation  of  mono-cytes towards an  anti-inﬂammatory  macrophage  phenotype  (M2)(Bernardo  and  Fibbe,  2013 ).  In  agreement  with  these  studies,  recentwork showed that  MSC  delivery  stabilized  atherosclerotic  plaquesand  decreased  apoptosis  and  inﬂammation  (Frodermann  et  al.,
2015;  Wang  et  al.,  2015c ).  Other  have  also  reported  that  MSC  deliv-ery  inhibited  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (Kanki-Horimotoet  al.,  2006 ).  Collectively,  these  studies  suggest  that  MSCs  are  apowerful  stem  cell  source  for  vascular  regeneration.1.3.3.  Effects  of  aging  on  stem  cell  functionAging  is  also  known  to  affect  tissue  regeneration  and  stem  cellfunction.  Studies  have  shown  that  aging  decreases  the  stem  cellpool  in  almost  all  tissues  in  the  body  including  hematopoietic,  neu-rogenic,  bone  and  muscle  tissues  (Garcia-Prat  et  al.,  2013;  Geigeret  al.,  2014;  Gruber  et  al.,  2006 ).  Along  these  lines,  several  cell  intrin-sic  features  of  aging  have  been  detected  in  EPCs  and  MSCs  includingtelomere  loss  (Baxter  et  al.,  2004;  Kushner  et  al.,  2009;  Thum  et  al.,2007 ),  DNA  damage  (Minieri  et  al.,  2015 ),  loss  of  nuclear  organi-
zation (Zhang  et  al.,  2011 )  and  increase  in  oxidative  stress  (Brandlet  al.,  2011 ).  EPC  and  MSC  function  is  also  affected  by  cell  extrinsicfactors  such  as  atherosclerosis  (Carracedo  et  al.,  2011 ),  hyperten-sion  (Imanishi  et  al.,  2005 )  and  inﬂammation  (Liu  et  al.,  2011b;Zhang  et  al.,  2009 ).  The  effects  of  vascular  aging  and  diseases  onEPCs  and  MSCs  are  summarized  in  Fig.  3  Speciﬁcally,  aged  EPCexhibit  decreased  proliferation,  survival,  migration/molbilization,and  enhanced  senescence  (Chang  et  al.,  2007;  Heiss  et  al.,  2005;Thum  et  al.,  2007 ).  In  addition,  aged  EPCs  are  susceptible  to  oxida-tive  stress  due  to  low  expression  and  activity  of  the  antioxidantenzyme  glutathione  peroxidase-1  (GPx-1)  (He  et  al.,  2009 ).  Edel-berg  et  al.,  also  demonstrated  that  in  contrast  to  aged  murine  bonemarrow-derived  EPCs,  young  EPCs  promoted  cardiac  angiogenesis,
mostly  due  to  high  expression  of  the  proangiogenic  factor  PDGF-
marrow-derived  EPCs,  young  EPCs  promoted  cardiac  angiogenesis,mostly  due  to  high  expression  of  the  proangiogenic  factor  PDGF-B  (Edelberg  et  al.,  2002 ).  Similarly,  EPCs  derived  from  patientswith  high  cardiovascular  risk  or  hypertension  exhibited  acceleratedsenescence  (Hill  et  al.,  2003;  Imanishi  et  al.,  2005 )  and  reduced  telo-merase  activity  (Imanishi  et  al.,  2005 ).  Treatment  with  young  bonemorrow-derived  progenitor  cells  (hematopoietic  and  stromal  pro-genitors)  isolated  from  non-atherosclerotic  ApoE−/−mice  reducedthe  atherosclerotic  burden,  whereas  progenitors  isolated  from  oldApoE−/−mice  had  no  effect.  This  effect  was  attributed,  in  part,  tothe  increased  EPC  count  (deﬁned  as  CD31+CD45−)  in  progenitorcell  isolations  from  young  mice  (Rauscher  et  al.,  2003 ).  In  addition,  arecent  large  scale  human  study  demonstrated  that  initial  exposure
to risk  factors  such  as  smoking,  diabetes  mellitus,  hypertension  andhyperlipidemia  increased  the  number  of  circulating  EPCs,  whereasprolonged  exposure  to  risk  factors  and/or  emergence  of  cardiovas-cular  disease  later  in  life  decreased  EPC  count  (Al  Mheid  et  al.,  2016 ).Low  EPC  count  has  also  been  associated  with  high  mortality  ratesin  patients  with  coronary  artery  disease  (Patel  et  al.,  2015 ).  On  theother  hand,  aging  of  healthy  individuals  does  not  lead  to  decreasedEPC  levels,  especially  in  CD34+,  CD34+/CXCR4+,  or  CD34+/VEGFR2+cell  population  (Al  Mheid  et  al.,  2016 ).Similar  to  EPCs,  MSCs  isolated  from  aged  individuals  exhibitreduced  life  span  in-vitro  and  undergo  senescence  earlier  as  com-pared  to  young  MSC  (Mendes  et  al.,  2002;  Stenderup  et  al.,  2003;Zhou  et  al.,  2008 ).  In  our  laboratory,  we  investigated  the  role
of  aging  on  the  myogenesis  of  MSCs.  To  this  end,  we  isolatedbone  marrow-derived  myogenic  progenitors  from  neonatal  andadult  sheep  using  a  smooth  muscle  /H9251-actin  promoter  to  driveexpression  of  green  ﬂuorescence  protein.  By  comparing  the  twocell  populations,  we  demonstrated  that  the  proliferation  capacity,the  myogenic  differentiation  potential,  the  contractile  phenotypeand  the expression of  extracellular  matrix  proteins  (collagen  andelastin)  were  greatly  diminished  with  aging  (Han  et  al.,  2010 ).Recently, we shed  light  into  the  mechanism  that  mediates  theeffects  of  aging  on  myogenesis  by  applying  two  widely  establishedmodels of aging:  culture  senescence  and  HGPS.  Our  results  clearlyshowed  that  aging  signiﬁcantly  impairs:  a)  the  response  of  cellsto the myogenic  signal  TGF-beta;  b)  the  ﬁlamentous  organization
of  ACTIN  (critical  for  force  generation  and  contraction);  c)  MRTF-Atranslocation  into  the  nucleus;  d)  SRF-dependent  myogenic  geneexpression  and  ﬁnally;  e)  the  ability  to  generate  contractile  force(Mistriotis  et  al.,  2017 ).  Although  the  link  between  cellular  aging(in  particular  the  cell  intrinsic  changes)  and  the  myogenic  dysfunc-tion  remains  elusive,  loss  of  the  proper  structure  of  the  nuclearenvelope  (e.g.  in  HGPS)  impaired  transport  of  MRTF-A  into  and  outof  the  nucleus,  which  subsequently  affected  actin  polymerization(Ho  et  al.,  2013 ).  Others  have  also  studied  the  effect  of  aging  onthe  anti-inﬂammatory  properties  of  MSC  reporting  that  aged  BM-MSCs  exhibited  reduced  migratory  and  anti-inﬂammatory  capacityin-vitro  and  in-vivo  (Bustos  et  al.,  2014 ).  Thus,  it  becomes  apparentthat  identifying  strategies  to  reverse  the  effect  of  aging  on  stem
cells  may  greatly  facilitate  the  development  of  cellular  therapiesfor  vascular  regeneration.
that  identifying  strategies  to  reverse  the  effect  of  aging  on  stemcells  may  greatly  facilitate  the  development  of  cellular  therapiesfor  vascular  regeneration.1.3.4.  Pluripotent  factors  for  reversal  of  stem  cell  aging  andvascular  regenerationRejuvenating aged  stem  cells  has  been  the  focus  of  several  stud-ies  over  the  years.  Various  approaches  include  hypoxia  (Fehreret  al.,  2007 ),  growth  factor  supplementation  (Coutu  et  al.,  2011 ),knockdown  of  cell  cycle  inhibitors( Yew  et  al.,  2011 ),  and  ectopicexpression  of  telomerase  (Murasawa  et  al.,  2002;  Simonsen  et  al.,2002 )  or  HPV16E6  /  E7  (Hung  et  al.,  2004 ).  Although  these  studiesprovided  evidence  of  stem  cell  rejuvenation  (especially  prolifera-tion),  they  failed  to  capture  all  aspects  of  stem  cell  aging  includingcell  intrinsic  changes,  differentiation  to  all  lineages,  extracellular
matrix  production  and  anti-inﬂammatory  properties  (propertiesimportant  for  reversing  vascular  aging).  In  fact,  although  ectopicexpression  of  human  hTERT  enhanced  proliferation  of  SMCs  fromaged  individuals,  it  failed  to  reverse  the  aging-associated  declinein  ECM  production  suggesting  that  a  more  systematic  approach  isrequired  to  study  reversal  of  cellular  aging  (Klinger  et  al.,  2006 ).In  addition,  whether  stem  cell  aging  can  be  reversed  is  still  underdebate  since  the  majority  of  the  studies  focused  on  delaying  ratherthan  reversing  stem  cell  aging.  Notably,  ectopic  expression  of  tel-omerase  in  senescent  ﬁbroblasts  failed  to  reverse  growth  arrest(Beausejour  et  al.,  2003 ).The  Yamanaka  group  showed  that  ectopic  expression  of  pluripo-tent  factors  can  reset  the  cellular  age  clock  and  transform  adult  cells
into embryonic  like  stem  cells  (Takahashi  et  al.,  2007 )  suggestingthat  this  approach  could  be  applied  to  reverse  organismal  aging.
P.  Mistriotis,  S.T.  Andreadis  /  Ageing  Research  Reviews  37  (2017)  94–116  107Fig.  3.  Effect  of  aging  and  diseases  on  stem  cell  properties.Indeed,  a  recent  study  demonstrated  that  short-term  induction  ofthe  Yamanaka  factors,  OCT4,  SOX2,  KLF4,  MYC  (OSKM)  in  proge-ria  mice  reduced  characteristic  hallmarks  of  cellular  aging  in-vitro(e.g.  DNA  damage,  reactive  oxygen  species,  nuclear  abnormali-ties,  senescent  markers,  SASP,  epigenetic  markers),  whereas  cyclicinduction  of  these  factors  prolonged  the  lifespan  in-vivo .  Notably,they also  reported  that  induction  of  OSKM  reversed  the  loss  of  SMCsin  the  aorta  of  progeria  mice,  suggesting  a  rejuvenating  role  in  theaged  vasculature.  Similar  results  were  also  obtained  using  late  pas-sage  human  cells  as  well  as  aged  mice  exhibiting  metabolic  diseaseand  muscle  injury  (Ocampo  et  al.,  2016 ).
and  muscle  injury  (Ocampo  et  al.,  2016 ).Along  these  lines,  we  hypothesized  that  ectopic  expression  ofa  single  pluripotent  factor,  NANOG,  may  be  sufﬁcient  to  reversecellular  and  organismal  aging.  In  fact,  NANOG  expression  in  MSCscorrelated  inversely  with  cellular  aging  (Tsai  et  al.,  2012;  Yew  et  al.,2011 ),  further  suggesting  that  it  might  play  a  critical  role  in  theaging  process.  In  addition,  studies  have  reported  that  NANOG  notonly  regulates  self-renewal  of  stem  cells  (both  embryonic  and  MSC)but  also  increases  proliferation  of  MSCs  (Boyer  et  al.,  2005;  Go  et  al.,2008;  Liu  et  al.,  2009;  Tsai  et  al.,  2012 )  by  directly  inducing  theexpression  of  DNA  Methyltransferases  that  methylate  the  promoterof  cell  cycle  inhibitors  such  as  p16  and  p21  and  decreases  senes-cence  (So  et  al.,  2011;  Tsai  et  al.,  2012 )  (Fig.  4).  In  our  laboratory,
we  focused  on  the  effects  of  NANOG  on  aged  MSCs.  Our  resultsdemonstrated  that  NANOG  reversed  a  signiﬁcant  part  of  the  tran-scriptome  that  changed  with  aging  and  completely  restored  theimpaired  myogenic  capacity.  These  results  were  veriﬁed  in  threedifferent  models  of  aging:  a)  organismal  aging,  b)  cellular  agingand c)  HGPS  model  (Han  et  al.,  2012;  Mistriotis  et  al.,  2017;  Shahiniet  al.,  2017 ).  Notably,  by  applying  a  tetracycline  inducible  vector,we  demonstrated  that  NANOG  not  only  delayed  but  also  completelyreversed  the  loss  of  myogenic  and  contractile  function  due  to  cellu-lar  aging  (Mistriotis  et  al.,  2017 ).  In  addition,  we  shed  light  into  themechanism  that  mediated  the  effects  of  NANOG.  We  reported  thatNANOG  restored  the  activity  of  the  TGFbeta  and  ROCK  pathways,thereby  activating  ACTIN  polymerization,  MRTF-A  translocation  to
the  nucleus,  SRF-dependent  myogenic  gene  expression  and  forcegeneration (Mistriotis  et  al.,  2017;  Shahini  et  al.,  2017 )  (Fig.  4).Results  in  our  laboratory  also  showed  that  NANOG  fully  restoredthe  impaired  extracellular  matrix  deposition  capacity  of  aged  MSCs(unpublished  data).  Others  have  shown  that  NANOG  also  mediatedthe  anti-inﬂammatory  properties  of  MSCs  through  expression  ofthe  anti-inﬂammatory  factors  such  as  TGF-beta  (Sun  et  al.,  2011 ).Currently,  we  seek  to  identify  whether  NANOG  can  also  reverseaging  in-vivo .Although NANOG  has  not  been  studied  in  aged  EPCs,  evidencesuggests  that  it  is  expressed  in  both  the  endothelium  of  developingvessels  as  well  as  in  cultured  ECs,  and  it  promotes  a  stem  cell  pheno-type  while  regulating  several  important  EC  processes.  Speciﬁcally,NANOG  induced  the  expression  of  VEGFR2  by  directly  binding  to
its  promoter  and  increased  the  proliferative  and  angiogenic  poten-tial  of  EC  (Kohler  et  al.,  2011 ).  NANOG  expression  was  regulated  by
its  promoter  and  increased  the  proliferative  and  angiogenic  poten-tial  of  EC  (Kohler  et  al.,  2011 ).  NANOG  expression  was  regulated  bythe  activation  of  the  Wnt  pathway.  Along  these  lines,  treatment  ofEC  with  low  dose  of  6-bromoindirubin-3’-oxime  (BIO,  activator  ofWnt  pathway  through  inhibition  of  GSK-3 /H9251//H9252)  induced  the  expres-sion  of  NANOG  and  upregulated  several  stem  cell  genes  including,Brachyury,  OCT4  and  CD133  (Kohler  et  al.,  2014;  Kohler  et  al.,  2011 ).BIO  also  induced  NANOG  expression  in-vivo  and  promoted  neovas-cularization  in  a  mouse  model  of  Hind  limb  ischemia  (Kohler  et  al.,2014 )  (Fig.  4).  Collectively,  these  studies  suggest  that  NANOG  mayrepresent  a  novel  gene  target  for  reversing  several  aspects  of  cellu-lar  aging,  thereby  increasing  the  potential  of  stem  cells  for  vascularregeneration  and  anti-aging  treatments.
regeneration  and  anti-aging  treatments.1.4. Conclusions-Future directionsIn  1891  Sir  William  Osler  stated,  “Longevity  is  a  vascular  ques-tion  which  has  been  well  expressed  in  the  axiom  that  man  is  onlyas  old  as  his  arteries”  (Lim  and  Townsend,  2009 ).  Therefore,  under-standing  the  complex  process  of  vascular  aging  may  enable  thedevelopment  of  therapeutic  strategies  to  prolong  lifespan.  In  thisreview,  we  provided  a  systematic  approach  to  uncover  the  causesof  vascular  aging.  We  primarily  focused  on  EC  and  SMC  aging  dueto  their  apparent  role  in  mediating  the  aging  phenotype  of  thevasculature.  We  identiﬁed  two  main  categories  of  factors  that  con-tribute  to  cellular  dysfunction,  intrinsic  and  extrinsic.  We  providedevidence  that  intrinsic  changes  my  cause  extrinsic  changes  andvice  versa  suggesting  a  mechanistic  link.  Currently  it  is  unclear
108  P.  Mistriotis,  S.T.  Andreadis  /  Ageing  Research  Reviews  37  (2017)  94–116Fig. 4.  Effects  of  NANOG  on  MSCs  and  ECs.how  this  link  is  established  and  which  of  these  changes  comeﬁrst during the  aging  process.  However,  it  is  possible  that  extrin-sic  changes  may  be  attributed  mainly  to  the  response  of  healthy(not  senescent)  vascular  cells/stem  cells  to  aging  and/or  diseases.Although,  such  response  is  required  for  the  proper  vascular  repair,the  repair  machinery  is  gradually  exhausted  resulting  into  cellintrinsic  changes  and  eventually  senescence,  as  seen  in  the  casesof  advanced  atherosclerosis  (Gorenne  et  al.,  2006 ).  Alternatively,intrinsic  and  extrinsic  changes  may  occur  simultaneously  duringaging  since  they  both  share  some  common  features  such  as  oxida-tive  stress  and  inﬂammation.  Early  on,  the  balance  may  be  tilted
towards  extrinsic  changes,  whereas  at  later  stages  of  aging  intrinsicchanges  may  prevail.This  review  also  highlights  the  importance  of  rejuvenat-ing/replenishing  aged  and  dysfunctional  ECs  and  SMCs  throughnovel  therapies.  Here,  we  provide  evidence  that  targeting  of  factors,which  mediate  cell  intrinsic  changes,  regenerate  the  aged/diseasedvasculature.  As  such,  advances  in  both  gene  delivery  and  geneediting  may  enable  the  development  of  cell  and  tissue  speciﬁc  ther-apies.  Along  these  lines,  CRISPR  represents  an  ideal  platform  forknockout  or  activation  of  a  speciﬁc  gene  that  participates  in  vascu-lar  aging,  as  it  enables  targeted  genome  editing.  Recent  work  by  Ranet  al.,  demonstrated  that  in-vivo  genome  editing  is  feasible  by  usingthe  small  Cas9  from  Staphylococcus  aureus  (SaCas9)  which  couldbe  packaged  into  adeno-associated  virus  vector  together  with  the
guide  sequence  of  interest.  They  reported  that  targeting  of  Pcsk9(cholesterol  regulatory  gene)  in  the  mouse  liver  decreased  serumPcsk9 as  well  as  serum  cholesterol  levels  with  high  speciﬁcity  (Ranet  al.,  2015 ).  However,  gene  therapies  require  special  considerationof  cell  targeting  as  different  cells  may  exert  different  responsesduring  knockout/activation  of  a  speciﬁc  gene.  For  example,  inhi-bition  of  immune  cell  proliferation  may  delay  the  progression  ofatherosclerosis,  whereas  SMC  senescence  may  be  detrimental  forthe  stability  of  the  atherosclerotic  plaque.  The  stage  of  the  diseaseis  another  area  of  consideration  since  vascular  cells  function  dif-ferently in the  initial  vs.  the  late  stages  of  the  disease.  Therefore,deeper  mechanistic  understanding  of  the  role  of  each  cell  type  invascular  aging  is  required.
vascular  aging  is  required.Stem  cells  represent  an  alternative  approach  for  vascular  regen-eration.  In  fact,  EPCs  and  MSCs  are  present  in  the  blood  vesselsand,  therefore,  the  development  of  strategies  to  mobilize  themmay  enhance  the  repair  of  the  damaged  vasculature.  Alternatively,targeted  stem  cell  delivery  may  also  prove  beneﬁcial  as  seen  inthe  case  of  MSC  delivery  to  atherosclerotic  plaques  (Frodermannet  al.,  2015;  Wang  et  al.,  2015c ).  However,  currently  few  studieshave  utilized  stem  cells  for  the  treatment  of  vascular  aging  andaging-associated  vascular  diseases,  which  may  be  attributed  to  thediminishing  effects  of  aging  on  stem  cell  function.  This  highlightsthe  importance  of  identifying  novel  strategies  to  restore  the  func-tion  of  aged  stem  cells.  Along  these  lines,  we  and  others  have  shown
that  pluripotent  factors  have  a  profound  effect  on  aging  and  stemcell  function,  including  proliferation  and  differentiation.  Interest-
that  pluripotent  factors  have  a  profound  effect  on  aging  and  stemcell  function,  including  proliferation  and  differentiation.  Interest-ingly  we  identiﬁed,  that  a  single  pluripotent  factor,  NANOG  canreverse  the  effects  of  aging  on  fundamental  cellular  properties  suchas  actin  polymerization  and  actomyosin  contractility  with  no  needto  reprogram  to  the  pluripotent  state.  Our  ﬁndings  suggest  thatNANOG  may  also  restore  the  function  of  other  types  of  aged  mus-cle  cells  such  as  skeletal  muscle  and  may  improve  critical  stem  cellfunctions  such  as  motility,  which  is  highly  diminished  during  aging(Kasper  et  al.,  2009 )  and  requires  the  actomyosin  machinery  forefﬁcient  migration  to  the  damaged  tissue  (Paul  et  al.,  2016 ).  How-ever, further  studies  are  required  to  decipher  the  role  of  the  otherpluripotent  factors  on  vascular  cells  and  adult  stem  cells.Acknowledgements
