Ghajar32, irina matei1, Hector Peinado1,33, Jacqueline bromberg34,35 & David Lyden1,14Despite Stephen Paget’s 126-year-old “seed-and-soil” hypothesis1, insufficient progress has been made towards decoding the mecha -nisms governing organ-specific metastasis. In experimental metas -tasis assays, Fidler et al. demonstrated that cancer cells derived from a certain metastatic site displayed enhanced abilities to metastasize to that specific organ, providing support for Paget’s organ-specific metastasis theory2. Subsequent studies investigating organ-specific metastasis focused largely on the role of intrinsic cancer cell proper -ties, such as genes and pathways regulating colonization, in directing
organotropism3–8. Breast cancer cells express chemokine receptors, such as C-X-C motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) and C-C motif receptor 7 (CCR7), which partner with chemokine ligands expressed in lymph nodes (CXCL12) and lung (CCL21), thus guiding metastasis3,4. Tumour-secreted factors can also increase metastasis by inducing vascular leakiness5, promoting the recruitment of pro-angiogenic immune cells6, and influencing organotropism7. Furthermore, the ability of breast cancer to form osteolytic lesions depends on osteoclast-  stimulating growth factors (for example, PTHRP and GM-CSF) released into the bone microenvironment4,8. Therefore, our previ -ous observation that metastatic melanoma-derived factors dictate organotropism is not surprising9. We found that medium conditioned by highly metastatic murine B16-F10 melanoma cells was sufficient to  expand the metastatic repertoire of Lewis lung carcinoma cells that would
typically metastasize to the lung9. We also showed that pre-metastatic niche formation requires S100 protein and fibronectin upregulation by lung resident cells, and the recruitment of bone-marrow-derived 1Children’s Cancer and Blood Foundation Laboratories, Departments of Pediatrics, and Cell and Developmental Biology, Drukier Institute for Children’s Health, Meyer Cancer Center, Weill  Cornell Medicine, New York, New York 10021, USA. 2Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology and Center for Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.  3Graduate Program in Areas of Basic and Applied Biology, Abel Salazar Biomedical Sciences Institute, University of Porto, 4099-003 Porto, Portugal. 4Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan. 5Proteomics Resource Center, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10065, USA. 6Department of Pathology, Memorial

Here we demonstrate that exosomes from mouse and human lung-, liver- and brain-tropic tumour cells fuse preferentially with resident cells at their predicted destination, namely lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells, liver Kupffer cells and brain endothelial cells. We show that
tumour-derived exosomes uptaken by organ-specific cells prepare the pre-metastatic niche. Treatment with exosomes from lung-tropic
tumour-derived exosomes uptaken by organ-specific cells prepare the pre-metastatic niche. Treatment with exosomes from lung-tropic models redirected the metastasis of bone-tropic tumour cells. Exosome proteomics revealed distinct integrin expression patterns, in which the exosomal integrins α6β4 and α6β1 were associated with lung metastasis, while exosomal integrin αvβ5 was linked to liver metastasis. Targeting the integrins α6β4 and αvβ5 decreased exosome uptake, as well as lung and liver metastasis, respectively. We demonstrate that exosome integrin uptake by resident cells activates Src phosphorylation and pro-inflammatory S100 gene expression. Finally, our clinical data indicate that exosomal integrins could be used to predict organ-specific metastasis.

These events establish a favourable microenvironment that promotes the growth of disseminated tumour cells upon their arrival9–11.Recently, we demonstrated that exosomes are one of the tumour-  derived factors inducing vascular leakiness, inflammation and bone mar -row progenitor cell recruitment during pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis11. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles (30–100  nm) containing functional biomolecules (that is, proteins, lipids, RNA and DNA) that can be horizontally transferred to recipient cells12–19.  We showed that an ‘exosomal protein signature’ could identify mel -anoma patients at risk for metastasis to nonspecific distant sites11. Moreover, in the context of pancreatic cancer exosomes, we defined
the sequential steps involved in liver pre-metastatic niche induction20.Taken together, these findings led us to investigate whether mole -cules present on tumour-derived exosomes are ‘addressing’ them to specific organs. To test this idea, we profiled the exosomal proteome of several tumour models (osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms tumour, skin and uveal melanoma, breast, colorectal, pancreatic and gastric cancers), all of which have a propensity to metastasize to spe -cific sites (that is, brain, lung or liver). We subsequently analysed the biodistribution of tumour-secreted exosomes and found that exosomal integrins (ITGs) direct organ-specific colonization by fusing with tar -get cells in a tissue-specific fashion, thereby initiating pre-metastatic niche formation. Remarkably, we found that tumour-secreted exosomes are sufficient to redirect metastasis of tumour cells that normally lack
the capacity to metastasize to a specific organ. Finally, our clinical data indicate that integrin expression profiles of circulating plasma exosomes isolated from cancer patients could be used as prognostic factors to predict sites of future metastasis. Our findings pave the way for the development of diagnostic tests to predict organ-specific  metastasis and therapies to halt metastatic spread.Future metastatic sites uptake exosomesTo examine whether tumour exosomes colonize specific organ sites, we isolated exosomes from organotropic human breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines that metastasize primarily to the lung (MDA-MB-231), liver (BxPC-3 and HPAF-II), or both (MDA-MB-468). We then  retro-orbitally injected 10  μ g of near infrared (NIR) or red fluorescently labelled exosomes into nude mice and, 24  h after injection, quanti -fied exosome biodistribution and uptake in distant organs by NIR  whole-lung imaging and confocal microscopy ( Fig. 1a  and Extended
Data Fig. 1a ). We observed a more than threefold increase in the uptake of MDA-MB-231 and/or 468- versus BxPC-3- and HPAF-II-derived exosomes in the lung ( Fig. 1a, b ). By contrast, liver uptake of BxPC-3 and HPAF-II exosomes was four times more efficient than that of MDA-MB-231 exosomes ( Fig. 1a, b ). Moreover, mouse E0771 breast cancer exosomes were four-to-fivefold more efficiently uptaken in lung, whereas mouse Pan02 pancreatic cancer exosomes were four times more efficiently uptaken in liver ( Extended Data Fig. 1b ). Therefore, the organ specificity of exosome biodistribution matched the organotropic distribution of the cell line of origin in both immune-compromised and immune-competent models.Figure 1  | Cancer-cell-derived exosomes localize to and dictate future metastatic organs. a, Biodistribution of human cancer-cell-line-derived exosomes in the lung and liver of naive mice.

We tested whether exosomes from the MDA-MB-231 sub-lines that colonize lung, bone or brain (4175-LuT, 1833-BoT or 831-BrT, respectively)21–24 would also exhibit organ tropism. Although exosomes from the MDA-MB-231 variants were similar in size and morphology ( Extended Data Fig. 1c ), their bio -distribution varied 24  h after injection: lung-tropic 4175-LuT exosomes preferentially localized to the lung with a more than fourfold increase in exosome-positive cells compared to 1833-BoT and 831-BrT exosomes (Fig. 1c–e  and Extended Data Fig. 1d ), whereas 831-BrT exosomes efficiently localized to the  brain with a more than fourfold increase compared to 1833-BoT and 4175-LuT exosomes ( Fig. 1c–e ). Liver and bone showed no significant differences in lung-, brain- or bone-tropic
MDA-MB-231-derived exosome distribution, with the exception of 831-BrT exosomes that were uptaken less efficiently by bone mar -row cells than exosomes isolated from other MDA-MB-231 sub-lines  (Fig. 1d, e  and Extended Data Fig. 1e ). Taken together, our data sug -gest that exosomes from different cancer models recapitulate the organ specificity of their cell of origin.Exosomes redirect metastatic distributionWe proposed that, in addition to cell-intrinsic genetic determi -nants of organotropism23,24, tumour exosomes could also facilitate  organ-specific metastatic behaviour by preparing pre-metastatic niches.To gain insight into tumour exosome uptake at future metastatic sites, we intravenously injected 4175-LuT exosomes labelled with  FM1-43 dye into naive animals, then used electron microscopy to distinguish endogenous from exogenous exosomes in lung sections. We detected tumour FM1-43-labelled exosomes in pre-metastatic
cells ( Extended Data Fig. 2a ; red arrows, exogenous tumour-derived exosomes; black arrows, endogenous stromal exosomes). Moreover, NIR whole-mount lung imaging revealed that NIR-labelled 4175-LuT exosomes accumulated in the lungs of naive animals after three con -secutive daily exosome injections ( Extended Data Fig. 2b ).To condition or ‘educate’ cells in specific organs, we retro-orbitally injected 4175-LuT or 1833-BoT exosomes into mice every other day for three weeks11. To test exosome education of target organs function -ally, luciferase-expressing 4175-LuT or 1833-BoT cells were injected into exosome-educated mice via the tail vein ( Fig. 1f, g  and Extended Data Fig. 2c ) or intracardially ( Extended Data Fig. 2d ). Lung-tropic 4175 exosomes marginally increased the lung-metastatic capacity of 4175-LuT tumours. Remarkably, education with 4175-LuT-derived exosomes, but not with 1833-BoT exosomes or PBS, yielded a signifi -
cant (sevenfold with intravenous and ten-thousand-fold with intracar -diac injections) increase in lung metastatic capacity of 1833-BoT cells (Fig. 1f, g  and Extended Data Fig. 2d ). Conversely, 1833-BoT-derived exosomes did not affect 4175-LuT cell metastasis to the lung ( Fig. 1f   and Extended Data Fig. 2c ). These data suggest that organotropic tumour exosomes prepare pre-metastatic niches potent enough to facilitate metastasis even for tumour cells poorly capable of colonizing these sites.Exosomal ITGs determine organotropismWe then postulated that exosomal adhesion molecules could regulate local microenvironments within future metastatic organs. Quantitative mass spectrometry of brain-, lung- and liver-tropic metastatic exosomes identified six integrins among the top 40 most abundant adhesion  molecules, making integrins the most highly represented protein family in this analysis. These data indicate a correlation between exosomal
integrins and metastatic tropism ( Extended Data Fig. 3a ).
in this analysis. These data indicate a correlation between exosomal integrins and metastatic tropism ( Extended Data Fig. 3a ).Interestingly, we found that integrin expression profiles corre -lated with tissue organotropism. Both quantitative mass spectrom -etry ( Fig. 2a ) and western blot analysis ( Fig. 2b  and Extended Data  Fig. 3b ) revealed that integrin alpha 6 (ITGα  6), and its partners ITGβ  4 and ITGβ  1 (ref. 25), were present abundantly in lung-tropic exosomes. By contrast, ITGβ  5, which associates only with ITGα  v (ref. 25), was detected primarily in liver-tropic exosomes ( Fig. 2a, b ). We confirmed these findings by exosome proteomics for 28 organ-specific metastatic cell lines ( Extended Data Tables 1  and 2). Qualitative mass spectrometry  revealed that ITGα  6 was present in lung-tropic exosomes, whereas ITGβ  5 was found in liver-tropic exosomes ( Extended Data Tables 1   and 2), consistent with our quantitative proteomics data. Exosomes
from 4173, 4175 and 4180 lung-tropic MDA-MB-231 variants expressed ITGα  6β 4 (Extended Data Table 1 ). Meanwhile, ITGβ  3 was present in exosomes isolated from brain-tropic cells (Extended Data Table 1).

All rights reservedor epithelial MCF10A exosomes, metastatic cell exosomes contained ITGα  2β 1, suggesting that this integrin could serve as a biomarker for metastasis (Extended Data Table 1). Importantly, exosomal integrin expression does not necessarily reflect cellular integrin expression, con -sistent with selective packaging of integrins in exosomes ( Extended Data Fig. 3c ). Taken together, our data suggest that exosomal integrin expression patterns underlie organotropism to the lung, liver and brain.Distinct cells uptake tropic exosomesTo identify the cells uptaking tumour exosomes in each organ, we intravenously injected red fluorescently labelled exosomes from 4175-LuT, 1833-BoT, BxPC-3-liver-tropic (BxPC-3-LiT) or 831-BrT  cells into mice ( Fig. 2c  and Extended Data Fig. 4a, b ). Both 1833-BoT  and 4175-LuT exosomes promoted vascular leakiness 24 h after
injection, before exosome uptake by specific lung cells ( Extended Data Fig. 4b ). These observations fit with our previous studies using melanoma exosomes11, suggesting that exosomes first per -meabilize vessels, allowing for exosome diffusion before uptake by parenchymal cells. Unexpectedly, we found that the specific  cell type responsible for exosome uptake varied depending on the metastatic organ. Lung-tropic 4175 exosomes mainly co-localized with S100A4-positive fibroblasts and surfactant protein C (SPC)-positive epithelial cells (40% and 30% of  exosome-positive cells, respectively) in the lung ( Fig. 2c  and Extended Data Figs 4 a and 5a, top). By contrast, pancreatic cancer exosomes derived from BxPC-3-LiT cells fused with Kupffer cells20 (90% of exosome-  positive cells; Fig. 2c  and Extended Data Figs 4 a and 5a, middle). Finally, 831-BrT exosomes interacted mainly with CD31-positive brain endothelial cells (98% of exosome-positive cells; Fig. 2c  and Extended
Data Figs 4 a and 5a, bottom). Collectively, these data demonstrate that specific tissue-resident stromal cells differentially uptake tumour exosomes in metastatic target organs.We proposed that the unique exosomal integrins may interact with cell-associated extracellular matrix (ECM), mediating exosome uptake in specific target organs. We found that 4175-LuT exosomes expressing ITGα  6β 4 and ITGα  6β 1 co-localized with S100A4-positive cells in laminin-rich lung microenvironments ( Extended Data Fig. 5b ,  top). Meanwhile, ITGα  vβ 5-expressing pancreatic BxPC-3-LiT exosomes co-localized with F4/80+ macrophages in fibronectin-rich liver microenvironments ( Extended Data Fig. 5b , bottom). Therefore,  specific exosomal integrins may selectively adhere to ECM-enriched cellular areas in the lung and liver.Figure 3  | Exosomal ITGβ4 expression functionally contributes to  4175-LuT exosome localization and mediates lung metastasis. a, Top,

To test the requirement for exosomal ITGβ  4 in lung tropism, we knocked down ITGβ  4 expression in 4175-LuT cells using short hairpin RNAs  (shRNAs) (4175β  4KD; Extended Data Fig. 6a ). We found a more than threefold reduction in labelled ITGβ  4KD exosomes in the lung com -pared with labelled control exosomes 24  h after injection ( Fig. 3a–c ). To test the requirement for exosomal ITGβ  4 binding to laminin for lung tropism, we blocked integrin binding using RGD and HYD-1 peptides. Pre-incubation of 4175-LuT exosomes with HYD-1, which blocks laminin receptors26, markedly reduced exosome uptake in the lung, whereas RGD, which blocks fibronectin receptors but not
ITGβ  4 (ref. 27), did not significantly alter exosome uptake in the lung ( Fig. 3a–c ). Pre-treatment of 4175-LuT exosomes with HYD-1 peptide also prevented their uptake by WI-38 lung fibroblasts  in vitro  (Extended Data Fig. 6b ). Conversely, ITGβ  4 overexpression in 1833-BoT exosomes was sufficient to increase exosome uptake in lung ( Extended Data Fig. 6c  and Fig. 3d ). These data demon -strate that integrins are responsible for organ-specific uptake of exosomes, and that ITGβ  4 promotes tumour exosome adhesion  within the lung.We next investigated whether ITGβ  4KD exosomes could modu -late the metastatic organotropism of 4175-LuT models. Knockdown of ITGβ  4 was sufficient to reduce the lung metastatic capacity of 4175-LuT cells ( Fig. 3e ). Education with 4175-LuT exosomes, but not ITGβ  4KD exosomes, rescued the metastatic ability of ITGβ  4KD cells, yielding metastasis similar to 4175-LuT cells ( Fig. 3e  and
Extended Data Fig. 6d ). Therefore, ITGβ  4-expressing exosomes can confer lung-metastatic behaviour to cells with limited capacity  to colonize the lung. Similarly, ITGβ  5 knockdown in BxPC-3-LiT  exosomes decreased liver uptake by sevenfold compared with con -trol BxPC-3-LiT exosomes (Extended Data Fig. 6e, f). Moreover, pre-incubation with RGD peptide or anti-ITGα  vβ 5 antibody, but not HYD-1 peptide, significantly reduced BxPC-3-LiT and Pan02-LiT exosome adhesion to the liver ( Extended Data Figs 6 g and 7a, respec -tively). Importantly, RGD peptides also inhibited the education effect of Pan02-LiT exosomes, subsequently blocking pre-metastatic niche formation and liver metastasis ( Extended Data Fig. 7b ). Our data sup -port the hypothesis that local microenvironmental changes induced by specific exosomal cargo (that is, ITGβ  4 or ITGβ  5) can dictate meta  static organotropism.Exosomal ITGs activate S100  genes
organotropism.Exosomal ITGs activate S100  genesTo identify the downstream effects of exosomal interaction with target cells, Kupffer cells were educated with either BxPC-3-LiT or BxPC-3-LiT ITGβ  5KD exosomes every other day for two weeks. Unbiased analysis of gene expression by RNA sequencing in Kupffer cells identified 906 genes upregulated more than twofold after treat -ment with BxPC-3-LiT exosomes compared to BxPC-3-LiT ITGβ  5KD exosomes. Cell migration genes were the most prominently upregu -lated (twofold for 221 genes; fourfold for 42 genes). Of these, S100A8  and S100P  were upregulated more than fourfold ( Fig. 3f ; GEO acces -sion GSE68919). Since pro-inflammatory S100  gene expression correlates with metastasis28,29, we analysed S100  genes in tumour exosome-educated lung WI-38 fibroblasts and in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs). Several S100  genes ( S100A4 , - A6, - A10,  - A11, - A13 and -  A16) were upregulated more than fivefold after

Moreover, exosome-treated lung fibroblasts proliferated and migrated more than controls ( Extended Data Fig. 7c, d ), which correlated with a higher frequency of S100A4+ cells in the lungs after three weeks of education with 4175-LuT, but not 4175β  4KD, exosomes ( Extended Data Fig. 7e ). We then surveyed, by in-cell western blot analysis, ITGβ  4 Figure 4  | Exosomal integrin expression as a potential predictor of patient organ-specific metastasis. a, Exosomal ITGβ  4 levels in breast cancer patients who were metastasis-free at the time of blood draw.

All rights reservedsignalling proteins30–34 in WI-38 fibroblasts treated with 4175-LuT or 4175β 4KD exosomes. Notably, only Src or phosphorylated Src (pSrc) levels increased in an exosomal ITGβ 4-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 7f ), consistent with the known roles of ITGα 6β 4 in Src activa -tion and S100A4 expression30. Therefore, in addition to their adhesive properties, exosomal integrins can activate Src and upregulate pro-  migratory and pro-inflammatory S100 molecules in specific resident cells within distant tissue microenvironments, influencing the expres -sion of genes implicated in facilitating tumour metastasis.Exosomal ITGs as organotropism biomarkersNext we investigated whether exosomal integrin content could predict tumour progression. ITGβ 4 levels were increased in the plasma of mice six weeks after orthotopic 4175-LuT cell injection into the mammary
fat pad, but were significantly reduced after successful tumour resection (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Furthermore, we performed ELISA assays for plasma-derived exosomal integrins in patients with lung (ITGβ  4) or liver (ITGα V, the binding partner of ITGβ 5) metastasis. We found increased ITGβ  4 levels in exosomes from patients with lung metastasis (regardless of tumour type) compared with patients with no metastasis or liver metastasis (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Exosomes isolated before metastasis from patients with breast cancer that progressed to develop lung metastasis (POD) expressed the highest levels of exosomal ITGβ 4 (Fig. 4a). ITGα v was significantly increased in exosomes isolated from cancer patients with liver metastasis compared with patients with no metastasis or lung metastasis (Extended Data Fig. 8c). Finally, exosomal ITGα v levels at diagnosis were higher in patients with pancreatic cancer
who developed liver metastasis than in those without liver metastasis within three years of diagnosis or in control subjects ( Fig. 4b ). Taken together, our data indicate that the specific exosomal integrins in breast and pancreatic cancer patient plasma correlate with and predict likely sites of metastasis.DiscussionSince Stephen Paget’s hypothesis first emerged, many studies have focused on identifying cell-intrinsic determinants of organ-specific metastasis3,7,23,24,35. We now show that tumour-derived exosomes prepare a favourable microenvironment at future metastatic sites and mediate non-random patterns of metastasis. We identify determinants of exosome-mediated organ-specific conditioning that allow the redirection of metastasis. Previously, adhesion and ECM molecules, such as integrins, tenascin and periostin, were shown to promote metastasis of disseminating cancer cells36–39. We define a specific repertoire of integrins expressed on tumour-
derived exosomes, distinct from tumour cells, which dictates exosome adhesion to specific cell types and ECM molecules in par -ticular organs. Notably, exosomes expressing ITGα vβ 5 specifically bind to Kupffer cells, mediating liver tropism, whereas exosomal ITGα 6β 4 and ITGα 6β 1 bind lung-resident fibroblasts and epithelial cells, governing lung tropism (Fig. 4c).Interestingly, bone-tropic exosomes expressed a limited integrin repertoire, but were capable of inducing vascular leakiness in the lung despite lack of uptake in the lung parenchyma. These results suggest that whereas induction of vascular leakiness may be the first exosome-mediated step during the metastatic cascade, it is insuffi -cient to promote metastasis. Thus, integrin-independent mechanisms may mediate vascular leakiness and exosome involvement in bone metastasis.Cell-type-specific exosome integrin uptake promoted pro-migratory  and pro-inflammatory S100 gene upregulation (S100A4, - A6, - A10,
-A11, - A13 and - A16 in lung fibroblasts; S100P and -A8 in Kupffer
and pro-inflammatory S100 gene upregulation (S100A4, - A6, - A10, -A11, - A13 and - A16 in lung fibroblasts; S100P and -A8 in Kupffer cells). Notably, tumour exosomes failed to elicit S100 upregulation in lung epithelial cells, highlighting the cell-type specificity of exosomal education. Since S100A4 regulates lung metastasis40 and is controlled by ITGα 6β 4 (ref. 41), we conclude that exosomal ITGα 6β 4 activates the Src–S100A4 axis in lung fibroblasts during pre-metastatic niche formation. Therefore, we propose that exosomal integrins not only promote adhesion, but also trigger signalling pathways and inflam -matory responses in target cells resulting in the education of that organ and rendering it permissive for the growth of metastatic cells.We provide the proof-of-principle that integrin-blocking decoy peptides successfully ablate tumour exosome adhesion in an integrin-  specific and organ-specific manner. Thus, it is no longer surprising that
targeting ITGα v in breast cancer cells prevented metastasis to other organs but not to the lung42–44. However, strategies targeting exosomal integrins may effectively block organ-specific metastasis. Collectively, our data suggest that exosomal integrins and exosome-inducible  S100 molecules in target cells represent candidates for anti-metastatic combination therapies.Overall, our findings suggest that circulating tumour-derived exosomes may be useful not only to predict metastatic propensity7, but also to determine organ sites of future metastasis. We believe exosomes perform distinct roles during each of the sequential steps (that is,  vascular leakiness, stromal cell education at organotropic sites, bone-marrow-derived cell education and recruitment) necessary to complete pre-metastatic niche evolution11,20,45.Future studies will focus on identifying exosomal integrins and pro -teins that could dictate metastasis to other organs, as well as further
exploring the potential of exosomal ITGα 2β 1 as a marker and driver of all cancer metastasis. Our findings demonstrate an important role for exosomes in dictating organ-specific metastasis, thus providing a basis for deciphering the mystery of organotropism.Online Content Methods, along with any additional Extended Data display items and Source Data, are available in the online version of the paper; references unique to these sections appear only in the online paper.received 30 October 2014; accepted 29 September 2015.

HBEpC cells were cultured in airway epithelial cell growth medium (PromoCell). All cells were
maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. FBS was depleted of bovine exosomes by ultracentrifugation at 100,000g  for 70 min. All cells lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma and were found to be negative.Exosome purification, characterization and analyses.  Exosomes were purified by sequential centrifugation as previously described46. In brief, cells were removed from 3–4-day cell culture supernatant by centrifugation at 500g  for 10 min to remove any cell contamination. To remove any possible apoptotic bodies and large cell debris, the supernatants were then spun at 12,000g  for 20 min. Finally, exosomes were col -lected by spinning at 100,000g  for 70 min. Exosomes were washed in 20 ml PBS and pelleted again by ultracentrifugation (Beckman 70Ti rotor). Exosome preparations were verified by electron microscopy. Exosome size and particle number were ana-lysed using the LM10 or DS500 nanoparticle characterization system (NanoSight,
Malvern Instruments) equipped with a blue laser (405 nm). Normal mammary fat pad tissue-derived exosomes were obtained by culturing five mammary fat pads isolated from healthy 4–6-week-old C57BL/6 mice in 3 ml of FBS-free RPMI for 12 h. The final exosome pellet was resuspended in PBS and protein concentration was measured by BCA (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific).Proteomics analysis.  Mass spectrometry analyses of exosomes were performed at the Rockefeller University Proteomics Resource Center using 20  μ g of exosomal protein. Samples were denatured using 8 M urea, reduced using 10 mM dithioth-reitol (DTT), and alkylated using 100 mM iodoacetamide. This was followed by proteolytic digestion with endoproteinase LysC (Wako Chemicals) overnight at room temperature, and subsequent digestion with trypsin (Promega) for 5 h at 37 °C. The digestion was quenched with formic acid and resulting peptide mixtures
were desalted using in-house made C18 Empore (3M) StAGE tips47. Samples were
37 °C. The digestion was quenched with formic acid and resulting peptide mixtures were desalted using in-house made C18 Empore (3M) StAGE tips47. Samples were dried and solubilized in the sample loading buffer containing 2% acetonitrile and 2% formic acid. Approximately 3–5 μ g of each sample was analysed by reversed phase nano-liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) (Ultimate 3000 coupled to QExactive, Thermo Scientific). After loading onto the C18 trap column (5 μ  m beads, Thermo Scientific) at a flow rate of 3  μ l min−1, peptides were separated using a 75-μ m inner diameter C18 column (3 μ m beads, Nikkyo Technos Co.) at a flow rate of 200 nl min−1, with a gradient increasing from 5% buffer B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile)/95% buffer A (0.1% formic acid) to 40% buffer B/60% buffer A, over 140 min. All LC–MS/MS experiments were performed in data-dependent mode. Precursor mass spectra were recorded
in a 300–1,400 m /z mass range at 70,000 resolution, and 17,500 resolution for fragment ions (lowest mass: m /z 100). Data were recorded in profile mode. Up to 20 precursors per cycle were selected for fragmentation and dynamic exclusion was set to 45 s. Normalized collision energy was set to 27.Semi-quantitative data analysis.  MS/MS spectra were extracted and searched against Uniprot complete human or mouse proteome databases (January 2013) concatenated with common contaminants48 using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific) and Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science). All cysteines were consid-ered alkylated with acetamide. N-terminal glutamate to pyroglutamate conver -sion, oxidation of methionine, and protein N-terminal acetylation were allowed as variable modifications. Data were first searched using fully tryptic constraints. Matched peptides were filtered using a Percolator49 based 1% false discovery rate
(FDR). Spectra not being matched at a FDR of 1% or better were re-searched allowing for semi-tryptic peptides. The average area of the three most abundant peptides for a matched protein50 was used to gauge protein amounts within and between samples.Label-free quantitative mass spectrometry.  LC–MS/MS data from three technical replicates of six organ-tropic samples were analysed using MaxQuant (version 1.5.0.30) and Perseus software (version 1.5.0.9)51, searching against a Uniprot human database (July 2014). Oxidation of methionine and protein N-terminal acetylation were allowed as variable modifications, and cysteine carbamidomethyl was set as a fixed modification. Two missed cleavages were allowed for specificity: trypsin/P . The ‘match between runs’ option was enabled. FDR values at the protein and peptide level were set to 1%. Protein abundance is expressed as LFQ values. Only proteins quantified in at least two out of three replicates in at least one group
were retained, and missing values were imputed. A multiple sample ANOV A test was performed and corrected for multiple hypotheses testing using a permuta -tion-based FDR threshold of 0.05.Exosome treatment and labelling . To assess lung, liver and bone exosome dis -tribution, exosomes were injected via the retro-orbital venous sinus, the tail vein or intracardially. Exosome distribution patterns were consistent regardless of the route of injection. For brain distribution, exosomes were only observed in the brain after intracardiac injection. For 24-h exosome treatments, 10 μ g of total exosomal protein were injected via the retro-orbital venous sinus, the tail vein, or intracardially in a total volume of 100 μ l PBS. For exosome-tracking purposes, purified exosomes were fluorescently labelled using PKH67 (green) or PKH26 (red) membrane dye (Sigma-Aldrich) or FM1-43FX dye (Life Technologies) for the photo-conversion experiment. Labelled exosomes were washed in 20 ml of PBS,
collected by ultracentrifugation and resuspended in PBS. When performing pep-
the photo-conversion experiment. Labelled exosomes were washed in 20 ml of PBS, collected by ultracentrifugation and resuspended in PBS. When performing pep-tide blocking experiments, exosomes were incubated with 0.06 μ M RGD or HYD-1 (peptide sequence: KIKMVISWKG) peptides for 30 min at 37 °C before exosome injection. An average of five random fields was counted per sample at 20×   magnifi -cation, and representative pictures were taken at 40×   magnification. For education experiments, mice received 10 μ g of exosomes retro-orbitally every other day for  3 weeks. To measure exosome uptake by specific cell types, labelled exosomes were injected 24 h before tissue collection and tissues were analysed for exosome-  positive cells by immunofluorescence. Pictures were taken at 60 × magnifica -tion. For in vitro  uptake assays, the membrane of WI-38 cells was labelled with PKH67 dye while 4175-LuT exosomes were labelled with PKH26 dye. Exosomes
(10 μ g ml−1) were first incubated with PBS or HYD-1 peptide for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by an incubation for 1 h with WI-38 cells at 37 °C. Excess exosomes were washed off and pictures were taken by Nikon confocal microscope (Eclipse TE2000U). The amount of exosomes localizing to the lung was analysed by immuno  fluorescence or using the Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). In brief, NIR dye-labelled exosomes were injected 24 h before tissue collection and tissues were analysed for exosome-positive areas. Whole-lung images were ana -lysed using image J software, quantifying red fluorescence area in arbitrary units.Photoconversion and electron microscopy processing.  Cryostat sections prepared at a 15-μ m thickness were placed on glass slides and re-fixed in 0.075 M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde. For photoconversion, slides were washed twice in 0.1  M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. Autofluorescence
was quenched using 100 mM NH4Cl in cacodylate buffer for 45 min. On the basis of optimization experiments, sections were photoconverted for 2 h by incubation in 5.4 mg ml−1 3,3′ -diaminobenzidine in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, and exposure to the light of an Intensilight C-HGFI 130-W mercury lamp and a 4× /0.1 NA objective (Nikon Inverted Microscope Eclipse Ti).For electron microscopy processing, sections were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide buffer for 15 min on ice. After washing with water, slides were placed in 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 30 min. Sections were washed with water, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol concentrations and subsequently in acetone for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were embedded in Eponate. Serial sections were cut at 70 nm in thickness and transferred to formvar-coated slot grids and imaged on a JEOL 100CX at 80 kV with an AMT XR41 digital imaging system.
Gene expression analysis.  Cell lines were analysed for specific genes using pre-designed TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems). In brief, RNA was extracted from tissues or cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and reverse transcribed using Superscript Vilo (Life Technologies). qRT–PCR was performed on a 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Relative expression was normalized to β -actin levels.Knockdown and overexpression cell preparation . For shRNA-mediated knock -down of ITGβ  4 and ITGβ  5, specific interfering lentiviral vectors containing GFP reporter and puromycin resistance gene cassettes were used.

As a control, we used the empty pLKO.1 vector. For retrovirus production for integrin overexpression, the pWZL and pBabe vectors systems were used. pWZL-hygro-ITGB4 and pBabe-puro-ITGB4 were provided by F. Giancotti. Lentiviral and retroviral particles were packaged using 293T cells. Infected tar -get cells were selected using 500 μ g ml−1 hygromycin B or 2 μ g ml−1 puromycin (Invitrogen).Flow cytometry analysis.  Bone marrow was prepared for flow cytometry as pre -viously described1. For analysis of lung, tissues were minced and then digested at 37 °C for 20 min with an enzyme cocktail (collagenase A, dispase and DNaseI, Roche Applied Science). Single-cell suspensions were prepared by filtering through a 70-μ m strainer and passing through an 18G syringe. Lung fibroblasts were identified by flow
cytometry using an anti-mouse rabbit polyclonal S100A4 (1:50, Abcam; ab27957), or SPC (1:100, Santa Cruz; FL-197), revealed by Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary (A-11011, Life Technologies, 1:400). For liver, tissues were mechanically dissociated, and single-cell suspensions were filtered through a 40-μ m strainer. Allophycocyanin-conjugated F4/80 (1:100, eBioscience; clone BM8) was used to identify liver macrophages by flow cytometry. Cell fluorescence indicating fluores -cently labelled exosome uptake was analysed using a FACSCalibur or a FACSCanto (Beckton Dickinson). FACS data was analysed with FlowJo software (TreeStar Inc.).Migration assay.  Twenty-thousand cells were plated in 24-well transwell plates with inserts (8-μ m pore size, Corning) and were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. Cell inserts were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min, followed by PBS wash and haematoxylin staining to allow visualization and counting. Nine random
fields were counted per well at 20×   magnification and the average number of migrated cells per field was calculated.Human studies.  Human peripheral blood samples were obtained from control healthy subjects and cancer patients with lung or liver metastasis, or from patients without distant metastasis at Weill Cornell Medical College, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Oslo University Hospital, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and University of Nebraska Medical Center, all pathologically confirmed. All individuals provided informed consent for blood donation on approved institutional protocols (WCMC IRB 0604008488 (DL), MSKCC IRB 12-137A (JB)). Plasma or serum exosomes were isolated as previously described1. ITGβ 4 and ITGα v levels in exosomes were measured by ELISA (ABIN417641 and ABIN417609 from Antibodies Online, and LS-F7188 from LifeSpan Biosciences), using 2 μ g of exosomes per 100 μ l of sample diluent, in duplicate reactions, accord -
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions.Mouse studies.  All mouse work was performed in accordance with institutional, IACUC and AAALAS guidelines, by the animal protocol 0709-666A. All animals were monitored for abnormal tissue growth or ill effects according to AAALAS guidelines and euthanized if excessive deterioration of animal health was observed. No statistical method was used to pre-determine sample size. No method of rand -omization was used to allocate animals to experimental groups. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. Mice that died before the predetermined end of the experiment were excluded from the analysis. In none of the experiments did tumours exceed the maximum volume allowed according to our IACUC protocol, specifically 2 cm3. For exosome localiza -tion, education and tumour implantation experiments for mouse cell lines, 6-week-
old C57BL/6 Mus musculus  females purchased from Jackson labs were used. For
tion, education and tumour implantation experiments for mouse cell lines, 6-week-old C57BL/6 Mus musculus  females purchased from Jackson labs were used. For exosome localization, education and tumour implantation experiments for human cell lines, 6–8-week-old NCr nude (NCRNU- F sp./sp.) females purchased from Taconic were used. For lung metastasis studies using organotropic lines, 6–8-week-old nude female mice were pre-educated with exosomes for 3 weeks followed by tail vein injection of 2 ×  105 or intracardiac injection of 1 ×  105 luciferase-positive cancer cells resuspended in 100 μ l PBS. Four weeks after intracardiac injection and eight weeks after tail vein injection, lung metastasis was measured using the IVIS 200 bioluminescence imaging system (Xenogen, Caliper Life Sciences), and tissues were cut in 6-μ m sections and stained with haematoxylin and eosin for histology. To analyse the role of exosome education in tumour metastasis, 6–8-week-old
C57BL/6 female mice pre-educated with pancreatic cancer-derived exosomes were injected intrasplenically with 1 ×  106 Pan02 mCherry cells resuspended in 30 μ l of Matrigel (Corning). One or twenty-one days later, mice were euthanized, and livers were analysed for metastatic lesions by measuring liver weight.To follow the levels of tumour-derived exosomes in plasma of tumour-bearing mice, 1 ×  106 4175 lung-tropic cells were injected in the mammary fat pad of nude mice. Mouse blood (250 μ l) was drawn from the retro-orbital sinus when tumour size was over 800 mm3, followed by tumour resection. One week after the tumour was resected, mice were analysed by bioluminescence IVIS imaging for luciferase activity and separated into two groups: recurrence/tumour-free and recurrent tumours. Mouse blood was drawn and the plasma of mice within the same group was pooled for exosome isolation. Western blot analysis with anti-human ITGβ  4
antibodies was used to detect tumour-derived exosomes.To assess exosome-induced vascular leakiness, 10 μ g of total exosome pro -tein were injected by retro-orbital injection. Then 20 h after exosome treatment, mice were injected with 2 mg of Texas Red-lysine fixable dextran 70,000 MW (Invitrogen) via retro-orbital injection. One hour after dextran injection, mice were euthanized and perfused with PBS. Lungs were dissected and fixed in a mix of 2% PFA and 20% sucrose overnight, then embedded in Tissue-tek O.C.T. embedding compound (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and frozen in a dry-ice/ethanol bath. O.C.T. blocks were sectioned and stained for DAPI, pictures were taken using a Nikon confocal microscope (Eclipse TE2000U). Images were analysed using image J software, quantifying red fluorescence area in arbitrary units.Tissue processing and immunofluorescence.  For histological analysis, tissues were dissected and fixed in a mix of 2% PFA and 20% sucrose in PBS overnight,
then embedded in Tissue-tek O.C.T. embedding compound. Blocks were frozen in a dry-ice/ethanol bath. For immunofluorescence, 6 μ m O.C.T tissue cryosections were stained with antibodies against F4/80 (1:100, eBioscience; BM8), fibronectin (1:50, Santa Cruz; IST-9), S100A4 (1:100, Abcam; ab27957), SPC (1:100, Santa Cruz; FL-197), laminin (1:50, abcam; ab11575), CD31 (1:100, Santa Cruz; MEC 13.3), EpCAM (1:50, Santa Cruz; HEA125). Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or 549 were used (A-11001 and A-11007, Life Technologies). Fluorescent images were obtained using a Nikon confocal microscope (Eclipse TE2000U) and analysed using Nikon software (EZ-C1 3.6).Western blot analysis.  Exosomes or cells were lysed with RIPA buffer containing a complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). Lysates were cleared by centrifu -gation at 14,000g  for 20 min. Supernatant fractions were used for western blot.
Samples were separated on a Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris Plus Gel (Life Technologies),
gation at 14,000g  for 20 min. Supernatant fractions were used for western blot. Samples were separated on a Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris Plus Gel (Life Technologies), and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore). Membranes were processed for Ponceau red staining followed by 1  h blocking and primary antibody incu -bation. The antibodies against the following proteins were used for western blot analysis: ITGβ  1 (1:1,000, Cell Signaling; 4706), ITGβ  4 (1:500, Cell Signaling; 4707), ITGα 6 (1:1,000, Cell Signaling; 3750), ITGα 2 (1:10,000, abcam; ab133557), ITGα 3 (1:1,000, abcam; ab190731), ITGα v (1:500, abcam; ab117611), ITGβ 5 (1:500, Cell Signaling; 4708), ITGβ 3 (1:500, Millipore; AB2984) Alix (1:1,000, Cell Signaling; 3A9), and GAPDH (1:10,000, Cell Signaling; 14C10).

Cells were plated in a 96-well plate and treated with 10 μ g ml−1 exosomes for 2 h and then processed according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. In brief, cells were fixed with 4% PFA and washed with 0.1% TritonX-100/PBS. Cells were then blocked using Odyssey blocking buffer for 1 h and stained overnight at 4 °C with pri -mary antibody in Odyssey blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20. The next day cells were washed again and incubated with LI-COR secondary antibodies for 1 h  at room temperature followed by fluorescent imaging using Odyssey.
