Many cosmetic companies have started to formulate neurocosmetic productsthat exhibit their activity on the cutaneous nervous system by affecting the skin’s neuromediators
through different mechanisms of action. This review aims to clarify the deﬁnition of neurocosmetics,and to describe the features of some functional ingredients and products available on the market,with a look at the regulatory aspect. The attention is devoted to neurocosmetic ingredients forcombating skin stress, explaining the stress pathways, which are also correlated with skin aging.“Neuro-relaxing” anti-aging ingredients derived from plant extracts and neurocosmetic strategies tocombat inﬂammatory responses related to skin stress are presented. Afterwards, the molecular basisof sensitive skin and the suitable neurocosmetic ingredients to improve this problem are discussed.With the aim of presenting the major application of Botox-like ingredients as the ﬁrst neurocosmeticson the market, skin aging is also introduced, and its theory is presented. To conﬁrm the efﬁcacy ofthe cosmetic products on the market, the concept of cosmetic claims is discussed.

IntroductionSkin and Brain: A Psychobiological ConceptThe skin, a wonderful and complex organ, manages the relationships between us andthe outside world. It provides information that allows us to analyze, examine, and monitorits status—to understand and know it. The skin can appear as a canvas on which a largepart of our interior world is painted: it is a dynamic structure, in continuous transformation,that expresses subjective psychological contents through which emotions take shape [ 1].The French writer and poet Paul Val éry, in a literary dialogue that binds the deep to thesurface being reported: “ What is most deep in man is the skin .” [2,3]. So, the concept of skin ismore complex than we can expect and, if at ﬁrst glance the skin’s surface can be considered
to be a passive barrier, on the contrary, it is more than just what the eye can see, and it is far
more complex than we can expect and, if at ﬁrst glance the skin’s surface can be consideredto be a passive barrier, on the contrary, it is more than just what the eye can see, and it is farfrom this concept [ 4,5]. Indeed, the skin is directly connected to the central nervous system,and it can be considered a living sensory receptor organ [ 6,7]. The Italian dermatologistEmiliano Panconesi reported the interesting and complex concept of a “ reuniﬁcation of thetwo ectodermal brothers, brain and skin ”, to indicate the whole sensations that arise from thecontact between one’s own skin and that of others [ 1]. As well described by Andrea Bovero,in his Dermocosmetology manual, the skin and the nervous system’s common origin deeplyinﬂuences the relationship that we have with ourselves and others. Touch is the senselinked to the skin, and requires constant contact between the touching body and element

Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 2 of 80touched: this contact generates deep sensations that translate into emotions that, in turn,can be perceived and communicated to others. Thus, hands represent the virtual extensionsof one’s interiority [ 1]. The French psychoanalyst Didier Anzieu, in his works The SkinEgo,A Skin for Thought , and Psychic Envelopes , developed a theory of the unconsciousconnection between the human skin’s protective and the coordinative ego functions. Withthis approach, Anzieu reported the surface of the body—the skin—as a key constituent ofthe mental structures and functions [ 8].Starting from these physiological functions (containing/retaining, separating/comm-unicating), Bovero reported Anzieu’s concept, and The Skin Ego acquires the dual possibil-ity to establish barriers and ﬁlter exchanges with the outside [ 1]. Just as the cell membranesdelimit the cells, ensuring their individuality, similarly The Skin Ego guarantees the body’s
individuality, differentiating it from others, enhancing and safeguarding the self-identity. Itis easy to understand that, if the skin represents an extension of the central nervous system,some skin manifestations could result from psychological discomfort [ 1]. For example,during facial dermatoses, such as seborrheic dermatitis or rosacea, some neuromediatorscould play an important role, and since sensitive skin clinically results in vasodilationand pain, it is probably linked to neuronal hyperactivation. Moreover, Misery reportedthat the nervous system is involved in many dry skin problems and delayed healing [ 9].Furthermore, Bovero described this concept as more complex, and the origin of psycho-somatic skin disease could also be sought in early childhood [ 1]. On the basis of theseconsiderations, it clearly appears plausible that the healing of several skin diseases couldbe improved through the combination of speciﬁc psychotherapeutic treatments [ 10], and
this concept has its root in 1925, with the dermatologist Joseph Klauder. In other words, ifthe skin is a seismograph that reproduces the psychological self-condition, on the otherhand, the body can choose to respond somatically to the different situations of anxietyand stress. Sometimes, these are normal skin reactions that quickly pass—such as a hotﬂash that accompanies a moment of embarrassment—but dermatological manifestationsthat evolve into real pathologies are often observed. Therefore, the most common skindiseases can also have psychosomatic origins and—for example—dermatitis, psoriasis,and some dermal allergies can be taken into consideration. As a result, this psychobio-logical concept moved towards a self-consistent medical–scientiﬁc discipline identiﬁed aspsycho-neuro-endocrine-immunology (PNEI); as reported by Bovero (2011) and Françaet al. (2017), PNEI can be deﬁned as the study of the relationship between the psyche and
the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems [ 1,10].The studies performed in this “new” and fascinating ﬁeld are radically transformingthe human approach and research, moving progressively from a sectorial vision of thedifferent organs, considered as independent systems, to a global vision of the wide networkof hormones, cytokines, and neuropeptides that closely connect mind and body. Once again,as well described by Bovero, the skin, nervous system, and immune system are integratedinto a single network that is deﬁned as the neuro-immuno-cutaneous system (NICS). [ 1].This interesting relationship between the skin and the nervous system was for a longtime neglected, but today represents one of the most important ﬁelds investigated in skinbiology. The associations between nerve ﬁbers and skin are very close from an anatomicaland physiological point of view, and these can be observed at the cellular level [ 11,12].
The complex concept related to “skin identity” clearly arises from these considerations,
and physiological point of view, and these can be observed at the cellular level [ 11,12].The complex concept related to “skin identity” clearly arises from these considerations,evidencing the skin’s importance not only because it acts as a protective barrier againstexternal aggressors [ 8,13], but also for its connection with the brain. Furthermore, it isworth mentioning that undamaged and intact skin is more attractive from an aestheticpoint of view, and it confers a youthful aspect [ 14]. Since good health also considersthe improvement of the skin’s appearance, the use of safer and more effective cosmeticproducts as a strategy, especially for combating skin aging, has progressively increasedover the years [ 15]. Indeed, with the increasing longevity of the worldwide population,good health has become essential for a better quality of life, even in advanced age. Hence,the skin becomes the target of any cosmetic product; as reported in Article 2.1 (a) of the
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 3 of 80European Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009: “ any substance or mixture intended to be placed incontact with the external parts of the human body (epidermis, hair system, nails, lips..) with a viewexclusively or mainly to cleaning them, perfuming them, changing their appearance, protectingthem, keeping them in good condition or correcting body odors ”. [15]. Thanks to the aim ofpreserving wellbeing over time, a cosmetic product should be considered a powerfultool that breaks down the barrier between beauty and health; for this reason, cosmeticsare largely used not only by beauty experts, but also by regular people throughout theday [ 16]. There are different cosmetic forms on the market, each with its own function anddifferent ingredients, which are used in novel products, meeting ancient traditions andrecent innovations, with the purpose of restoring and improving skin blemishes. However,
as already discussed, since these imperfections—generated by an external and internaldiscomfort—are the consequence of some phenomena of a physio-pathological nature(which manifest themselves on the skin, and are reﬂected at the physical, psychological,and social levels) [ 1], the concept of “traditional” cosmetics has been overpassed in the lastyears, looking instead for skincare products able to affect skin–brain connections: theseare neurocosmetics. They generate many doubts when confused with the neurosciencesor the wellbeing and hedonistic feelings arising from the use of cosmetic products. Thus,this review aimed to clarify these ambiguous concepts, contextualizing the applicationsof neurocosmetics. The review is opened by brieﬂy describing the well-known cosmeticfunctions and uses that have been regulated for years, then landing in the neurocosmeticworld, presenting it carefully. With the aim of understanding some general concepts
about the functions of neurocosmetics, ingredients available on the market for a skincarebeauty routine will be examined. The connection between skin and brain will be thusexplored, along with a view on skin aging, offering an overview of what is known aboutthis fascinating neurocosmetic research ﬁeld, and what is still ambiguous. Finally, someaspects of cosmetic claims and efﬁcacy, safety assessment, and regulation of cosmeticproducts, in order to frame the regulation of neurocosmetics, will be further discussed.2. A Brief Overview: From Cosmetology and Cosmetic Functions to NeurocosmeticsIn agreement with the European Regulation (EC) 1223/2009, cosmetic products aredesigned for a speciﬁc use, and equipped with several features that they can exhibit throughdifferent mechanisms of action [ 16]. Cosmetology is the science that studies the cosmetics’mechanisms of action and their biological effects in humans, deﬁning how to use them.
In particular, the ﬁeld of functional cosmetics aims to formulate products for restoringthe normal skin balance, preventing or counteracting the onset of any blemishes. It is worthmentioning that the physiological balance is a dynamic condition; thus, it does not refer toa situation in which transformation processes do not take place (static balance), but to asystem in which transformation processes continuously occur under dynamic equilibrium.When the skin is examined, as for any other organ, it should be thought of as a system inwhich several biochemical reactions take place, ensuring the life of cells and tissues. Asa result, under normal physiological conditions, all of these reactions are in equilibriumwith one another. However, in particular situations, this equilibrium can be lacking, withdifferent consequences on the skin (for example, changes in pH, alterations in the watercontent, changes in the composition of the hydrolipidic ﬁlm, and so on) [ 1]. In general,
our organism is able to self-restore its normal “physiological” conditions but, in some
content, changes in the composition of the hydrolipidic ﬁlm, and so on) [ 1]. In general,our organism is able to self-restore its normal “physiological” conditions but, in somecases, the imbalances get worse, encouraging the onset of blemishes or real pathologies.Therefore, several cosmetic treatments represent useful tools for ameliorating some skinmanifestations, such as acne [ 1]. However, cosmetics must not claim therapeutic properties,but should protect the skin, keeping it in good condition and carrying out preventiveactivities [ 17–20].Although cosmetics are formulated with many ingredients with different functions, itis possible to distinguish them into three main classes, according to their prevalent function:skincare (protective/nourishing function), makeup (aesthetic/decorative function), andtoiletries (hygienic/cleansing function). In particular, the cosmetic functions allow us to
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 4 of 80classify different products according to their activity performed at the skin or mucosallevel.By focusing the attention on the skincare category, which represents the topic of thisreview, this class includes all products that aim to preserve, over time, the physiologicaland functional skin characteristics of the area where they are applied. However, sincemodern cosmetology is mainly oriented towards the formulation of products with “mixedfunctions”, referring to a broad spectrum of activities, it is clear that these differences areobsolete. Starting from these considerations, the boundary between the different cosmeticfunctions is narrowing; there is a tendency towards a general concept of cosmetics inwhich beauty and wellbeing become essential both for skin health maintenance and for theprevention of skin blemishes and diseases. Focalizing the attention on the action exhibitedby different cosmetic ingredients, it is possible to identify [ 1]:
• Anti-aging action: this refers to all ingredients that, via different pathways, combat theskin aging processes, preventing and ﬁghting the signs of aging, revitalizing senescentskin, promoting the elimination of toxins, improving microcirculation, and reducingthe number and the depth of wrinkles;• Antioxidant action: this includes ingredients that can capture and inactivate freeradicals at the skin level, reducing the “oxidative stress”;• Anti-wrinkle action: this concerns ingredients that counteract the onset of wrinkles;• Depigmenting action: this includes ingredients that lighten the skin color;• Eudermic action: this considers ingredients that invoke a feeling of wellbeing whenapplied on the skin;• Eutrophic action: this refers to substances that nourish the skin and improve itsappearance;• Soothing, anti-redness action: exhibited by ingredients able to soothe pain and reduceskin redness in cases of mild inﬂammation, counteracting irritation, and bringing
relief to stressed skin;• Regenerating action: this refers to ingredients with eutrophic properties, promotingcell regeneration, and providing the necessary elements for skin development andmaintenance over time;• Toning, “lifting” action: this concerns ingredients that restore skin tone and ﬁrmnessby acting at both the epidermis and dermis levels, encouraging the typical turgor ofyoung and healthy skin [ 1].Interestingly, recent research advances against skin aging have developed innovativeproducts [ 14,15]—the so-called neurocosmetics—that could revolutionize the cosmeticworld due to their fascinating properties. The ﬁrst deﬁnition of these very interestingproducts was attributed to Prof. Misery in 2000, referring to them as “not absorbedproducts applied on the skin, exhibiting activity on the cutaneous nervous system or ingeneral effects on the skin mediators” [ 9]. So, neurocosmetics are nontoxic, bioactive topical
products that contain ingredients designed to work at a neurological level [ 5], and notelsewhere [ 21,22].Furthermore, today, consumers are looking for “technological” skincare products thatcould prevent skin aging, protect skin from environmental damage, and provide cosmeticoptions for several skin problems. In particular, consumers’ preference is devoted to theresearch of natural, non-irritating, preservative-free, and green products. Hence, it shouldbe mentioned that the challenges of manufacturers are devoted to the development ofsafe, stable, and effective products that, at the same time, are eco-sustainable and meetconsumer demands [ 23].The most common ingredients are botanicals, marine extracts, peptides, and vitaminsas antioxidants [ 2].On these grounds, in the following paragraphs, a careful discussion is presented aboutneurocosmetics, offering to the readers an overview of their actions at the skin level and
the related important mechanisms that can be affected by their use.
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 5 of 803. The Neurocosmetics3.1. Towards Neurocosmetics and How to Understand It: A More in-Depth Insight about SkinInnervation and NeurotransmittersSkin is constituted by the epidermis—the outer, waterproof, stratiﬁed, squamousepithelium layer of ectodermal origin—and dermis, the inner and thicker supporting layerof connective tissue of mesodermal origin (Figure 1) [24,25]. A dense innervation involvesthe outermost skin layers, except for the stratum corneum [ 9,25].Figure 1. Diagram of the skin.From the spinal cord, sensitive nervous or neuro-vegetative ﬁbers innerve the skin [ 9],modulating thermoregulation, sebaceous secretion, or melanogenesis [ 4], explicating onceagain the deﬁnition of Misery “ Les nerfs àﬂeur de peau ” [9]. Indeed, many emotions are felt atthe skin level: fear, stress, and happiness manifest themselves in paling (vasoconstriction),sweating, goosebumps, raised hairs, blushing (vasodilatation), or radiance [ 8].
The skin, as a system for the surveillance of environmental changes (heat, humidity,etc.) and perception of the environment (body limits, recognition of the non-self andobjects, touch, etc.), produces stimuli that, through mediators, are transmitted to thenervous system [ 12,24]. For example, among mediators, there are neurotransmitters [ 24,25];These are chemical messengers, naturally synthesized by nervous ﬁber endings, that arealso produced by skin cells (keratinocytes, melanocytes, ﬁbroblasts, etc.) and the immunesystem [ 11,12].The release of neuromediators can be induced by physical, chemical, or even emotionalstimuli [ 26]. Among the 200 neuromediators currently known, about 25 have been foundin the skin. Some examples include neuropeptides such as substance P , calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and bradykinins; neurohormones such as melanocyte-stimulatinghormone (MSH), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH); catecholamines; enkephalins;
endorphins; and acetylcholine [ 9,26]. However, the neuromediators’ level changes accord-ing to the person and their physiological or pathological circumstances [ 9,26]. Speciﬁcreceptors for these neuromediators, and enzymes for degrading them, are expressed bycutaneous and immune cells. The binding of neurotransmitters to receptors induces themodulation of cell properties and skin functions (immunity, cell differentiation, prolifera-tion, pigmentation, etc.). For example, substance P activates keratinocytes by increasing thesynthesis of interleukin 1 αandβ, interleukin 8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF- α), as wellas intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression on the keratinocyte surface [ 9,26].Hence, keratinocytes, Langerhans cells, melanocytes, endothelial cells, ﬁbroblasts, andother skin or immune system cells are modulated and controlled by nerves. Reciprocally,the skin can modulate neuronal activity and growth. Nerve growth factors are slightly
involved for this purpose, controlling both the neuronal growth and the neurotransmitters’secretion [ 9,26].
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 6 of 80The result is that the skin is the window that connects the nervous, immune, cutaneous,and endocrine functions; it is important for maintaining physiological homeostasis [ 27].As previously mentioned, the skin can interact with both endogenous and exogenousstimuli, and it is the target of nonmedical and medical treatments for healthy and diseasedstates.This interesting connection, where the skin transmits and receives information from in-ternal and external sources, induces the response of the neuroimmune-cutaneous-endocrine(NICE) system [ 5,9], and is useful for understanding neurocosmetics and the related brain–skin connection for skincare.3.2. Neurocosmetics, the Cosmetic of Neurotransmitters: The Brain and SkincareAfter the deﬁnition of Misery in 2000 [ 10], neurocosmetics only began to receive greatattention during the annual meeting of the New York Society of Cosmetic Chemists in
2007 [ 28]. To improve the skin’s appearance and imperfections, neurocosmetic research wasmainly focused on ingredients with structural analogies to endogenous neuromediators.Hence, when formulating neurocosmetics, considering that skin cells have receptors thatbind neurotransmitters to regulate their functions, the knowledge of the connection mecha-nisms between the skin and the brain should be useful in choosing functional ingredientsable to interact with both systems, obtaining speciﬁc results [ 2,9,29].For example, by targeting nerve clusters sensitive to heat, cold, pain, itching, and/orpressure, neurocosmetic products can affect the brain’s responses to topical treatments.More speciﬁcally, the involved receptors send signals to the spinal cord that are subse-quently transmitted to the cerebral cortex [ 2,12,28,30].Neurocosmetic ingredients can act by following the mechanisms reported below:
• Directly on the cutaneous nervous ﬁber endings [ 9], as modulators of the neurotrans-mitter release [ 14]. Examples are the botulinum-like peptides that encourage facialmusculature relaxation to obtain wrinkle-smoothing, and peptides that inhibit neu-rons, mainly used to make hypersensitive skin less reactive towards environmentalstimuli (temperature changes, air humidity, smog, etc.) [ 9];• They modulate non-nervous cells’ functions as agonist/antagonist molecules of theneuropeptide receptors or neurotransmitter effects modulators [ 9,14].To clarify the concept of a neurocosmetic functional ingredient, a simple example isrepresented by menthol and its derivatives, which can act on the skin as a physical coolantor a heat source, according to the used formulations, area of application, and amountused [ 31–34].However, over the years, a great number of functional ingredients—such as biomimetic
peptides [ 35] deriving from different origins [ 36], and several plant extracts [ 37], able toperform neuro-modulatory actions—have been developed [ 38–40].As a result, a new way to bring beneﬁts to the skin’s nervous system arises, whichresults in improved skin health, and the potential impact of this emerging ﬁeld on skincareis signiﬁcant [ 2]. Indeed, cosmetic manufacturers would treat the individual as a whole:the body and the mind.However, it should be mentioned that neurocosmetics are largely used in anti-agingproducts. Therefore, neurocosmetic activities, by targeting the interactions between theskin and the nervous system, can play a signiﬁcant role in skin balance [ 15,29].In particular, neurocosmetics can render the skin smoother, more radiant, healthier,and less wrinkled, decreasing the inﬂammatory response and conferring a soothing effect.For example, savvy brands try to overpass the traditional cosmetics limits, formulating
skin solutions to ﬁght stress and aging [ 2]. Thus, neurocosmetics seems to be the newcosmetic trend, but is everything really clear? Or are neurocosmetics manufacturersmisleading with the idea that the use of some products—especially referring to makeup
cosmetic trend, but is everything really clear? Or are neurocosmetics manufacturersmisleading with the idea that the use of some products—especially referring to makeupproducts—“induce” feelings of pleasantness and wellbeing?
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 7 of 803.2.1. Feelings of Pleasantness and Wellbeing vs. NeurocosmeticsIn most of the relevant online blogs, it is possible to read that the world of cosmeticsis increasingly oriented towards a holistic vision of beauty, confusing the feelings ofpleasantness and wellbeing derived from the application of a cosmetic product with apleasant texture that induces hedonistic sensations, with neurocosmetics. The same occursif a cosmetic is packaged in a particular way. A peculiar sensory experience, felt during theuse of personal care products, can reduce life stress and, at the same time, persuade theconsumers to buy a product from a speciﬁc brand. For example, when leave-on skincareproducts are taken into account, the sensory feel is an important aspect. Indeed, in thiscase, a sensory experience is offered to the consumers, which must not be confused withthe neurocosmetic effects [ 41,42].
the neurocosmetic effects [ 41,42].Moreover, cosmetic products described as euphoric or antidepressant are not un-common. Several cosmetic companies proposed “happiness cosmetics”, associating them,uncritically, with neurocosmetics, due to the presence of particular active ingredients intheir formulation [ 8,43]. Some examples are reported in the following: Kenzoki Face FelicityIlluminating Serum, proposed by KENZO, induces the brightening of the facial skin usingthe white lotus extract in its formulation [ 44–48]. DEBORAH GROUP LABORATORIESdeveloped the Gloss Euphoric Shine, a lipstick with a mix of components “that gives animmediate feeling of wellbeing” due to the presence of the nourishing and moisturizingblue poppy extract, omega-6 and -9, vitamins, and the innovative molecule EuphorylTMΩ3 [49]. This active ingredient is a mix of Sacha inchi oil—rich in omega-3 [ 50–52]—andSchinus terebinthifolia (pink pepper) extract [ 37,53]. Omega-3 fatty acids help to counteract
hypersensitivity, dryness, and inﬂammation, reﬁning skin appearance, and also have an-tioxidant properties, thereby helping keep women’s skin healthy and glowing. EuphorylTMencourages dopamine synthesis at the skin level, allowing the lightening of the complexion.Furthermore, subjective studies have shown that it improves skin hydration, freshness, andcomfort, which is signiﬁcantly perceived by consumers [ 54]. However, the claims reportedfor this product could be misunderstood by consumers, erroneously making it appear tobe a neurocosmetic.So, the concepts of neurocosmetics, “good mood” cosmetics, and neurosciences areoften discussed without drawing attention to their substantial differences, rendering theconcepts unclear for both consumers and cosmetic experts as a consequence [ 55].Although, for years, the fascinating and complex interconnection between the skinand the brain has drawn strong interest among cosmetic companies for its potential, the
topic is very intricate, and it is perceived as confusing and fragmented [ 5,26,56,57].Indeed, since the molecules synthesized at the brain level (brain, cerebellum, and brainstem) are the same as those used by the cutaneous nervous system for cell communication,an ability to regulate complex phenomena, such as mood, has been wrongly attributed toneurocosmetics.This tendency to confer neurocosmetic functions to non-neurocosmetic ingredientscould be called “neurocosmetics-ﬁction” [ 11]. This is so far from the correct deﬁnitionof neurocosmetics that it can be better clariﬁed considering the examples of Schinus tere-binthifolia extract and Sacha inchi oil (EuphorylTMO3) activity to explain the role of afunctional neurocosmetic ingredient. Firstly, it should be taken into account that manyneurotransmitters and neurohormones, typically produced and released by the nervoussystem (serotonin, dopamine, endorphins, etc.), can also be produced and released in loco
by speciﬁc skin cells, acting with different local functions. In this particular case, it has
system (serotonin, dopamine, endorphins, etc.), can also be produced and released in locoby speciﬁc skin cells, acting with different local functions. In this particular case, it hasbeen widely demonstrated that, when applied to the skin, the Schinus terebinthifolia andSacha inchi extracts can increase the release of dopamine by skin neurons, leading to twoeffects: the enhancement of skin blood supply and the skin barrier performance, and aglobal improvement of the complexion [ 58–60].However, it must be highlighted that these effects differ from those observed whendopamine is produced at the central nervous system level, where dopamine plays therole of a neurotransmitter involved in brain network complexes associated with pleasure,
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 8 of 80satisfaction, and good mood [ 61]. Thus, the aforementioned neurocosmetics must not beconsidered to be “products” able to act on mood and happiness; attributes such as “antide-pressant”, “happiness”, “euphoric”, and “exhilarating” have been mistakenly conferred toproducts containing these extracts, going towards the pharmacological (and psychiatric)spheres, different from neurocosmetics. Indeed, only if the release of cutaneous dopamineis massive should it penetrate the blood, reaching the brain, but this is a not a probablescientiﬁc hypothesis for a cosmetic product that, by deﬁnition, must not penetrate the skin,and should remain on the epidermis [ 11].Unfortunately, marketing uses these inaccurate concepts to attribute false claims tosome cosmetic products—particularly belonging to the makeup category; this type of claimhas led to poor market outcomes, inducing discomfort and fear in consumers [ 11].
In conclusion, neurocosmetics must not be confused with psychocosmetics or neuro-sciences, as better detailed in the following two paragraphs.PsychocosmeticsWith respect to neurocosmetics, the concept of psychocosmetics is intrinsically corre-lated with the concept of cosmetics itself. Indeed, cosmetic products help one to have apositive perception of oneself (self-esteem); therefore, cosmetics are promoters of wellbeing,enabling the relationships and conditions necessary to obtain gratiﬁcation [ 62].So, although cosmetics, by deﬁnition, are not considered to be drugs, they have afundamental role in promoting health due to their ability to improve the individual’smental and social wellbeing, mood, and quality of life [ 60,63].As a consequence, all cosmetics can be considered to be psychocosmetics, from de-odorants, skin moisturizers, makeup, detergents, etc., to oncological aesthetics, which
is deﬁned as the noble cosmetics branch that helps women to take care of their image,especially if altered by anticancer therapies [ 11].NeurosciencesNeurosciences, with respect to neurocosmetics, are devoted to the study of the nervoussystem. As reported by Lombardi et al. (2019), there are different branches of neuroscience,depending on the research studies, methods, and tools. Some examples are:• Cellular Neurosciences study the behavior of nervous cells in vitro ; these relatedexperiments are usually performed by manufacturing companies on neurocosmeticfunctional ingredients;• Behavioral Neurosciences study the cognitive (thoughts, memories, and other mentalprocesses) and affective (emotions, feelings, and mood) behavior of individuals [ 11].Neuroscience Applications in the Cosmetic FieldIn recent years, neuroscience and psychological research have become an importanttopic both for marketing strategies and for research linked to consumers [ 55,62].
Not surprisingly, experts in neurology, psychology, and neuroscience have demon-strated that emotions, and the unconscious connection between consumers and products,could strongly affect the consumers’ choices for purchasing cosmetics; hence, these studiescan provide additional information for innovative products [ 60].Niedziela reported that a cosmetic product seen on the shelf is an example of ap-plied consumer neuroscience: it creates an immediate and strong impression on the con-sumer [ 41] and, in this case, it is important to understand how the product labeling andpackaging affect the consumer’s perceptions. Emotions play a signiﬁcant role in thedecision-making process, mixing the unconscious and conscious aspects of the experience.As a result, the addition of emotional proﬁling to the traditional and sensory proﬁling hasadded a new dimension during product development [ 41].To create more appealing packaging designs, the psycho-behavioral approach and
the traditional market research, neuroscientiﬁc, and psychological methodologies could be
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 9 of 80combined for understanding not only consumer expectations (brand perceptions), but alsounconscious interactions with consumer products [ 41].For example, the action readiness (whether the product is used or purchased) andautonomic stimulation (which reﬂects the degree of motor preparation for a certain action)are typically evaluated with physiological measures of the autonomic nervous system(ANS), where different aspects of the products are evaluated, and each type of evaluationis associated with speciﬁc physiological, expressive, or motivational changes [ 41].Among methodologies, it is worth mentioning a range of techn ologies, from biometrics—such as heart rate variability (HR), galvanic skin response (GSR), facial electromyography(fEMG), etc.—to brain imaging, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).Biological, psychological, and ethological data can also be collected and analyzed byusing different methods:
using different methods:• Vital parameters such as heart activity recorded with ECG [ 64], respiratory activ-ity/frequency, salivary samples for monitoring cortisol release [ 65,66] (i.e., the de-crease in cortisol secretion in saliva after the use of a soothing cream should beobserved) [ 56,67], thermography related to cutaneous blood ﬂow (i.e., when blushing,etc.), the evolution of facial skin temperature under stress [ 64], and the electrical cur-rent perception threshold (CPT); the hyperexcitability of nerve endings (A β) increaseswith age, in which a threshold increase indicates a reduction of unpleasant excitability,(i.e., an improved state of wellness . . . ) [ 64];• Psychometric tests (perceived stress), such as the Ethological Coding System for In-terviews (ECSI) (non-verbal behavior) [ 68,69]. Furthermore, using questionnaires,the effects (the hedonic pleasure of products) and appraisal (good/bad or pleas-ant/unpleasant) can be evaluated.
ant/unpleasant) can be evaluated.For cosmetic products, texture is also strongly involved in customer loyalty, so theemotional effects of tactile stimulation could be one of the keys to creating successfulproducts. By means of neuroscientiﬁc instruments and methodologies, Lombardi et al.(2017) demonstrated in their study that three lip balms, containing the same ingredients—different for only one emollient—could trigger different emotional responses during theirapplication to the lips [ 70]. In detail, “lip balm 1” contained Octyldodecyl PCA, “lip balm2” contained octyldodecanol, and “lip balm 3” contained Lauryl PCA—all at the sameconcentration. Moreover, the products tested had the same appearance and aroma. Theresearch demonstrated that the ﬁnal results were associated only with the tactile propertiesof the stimulus. For this purpose, the Authors used simultaneous electroencephalography(EEG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) measurements throughout the whole experiment.
EEG is a non-expensive, noninvasive, and passive technique that, by using electrodesplaced on the scalp, records the electrical activity generated by neurons’ synchronizedactivity. GSR is one of the most sensitive methods for emotional arousal—the phenomenonby which the skin temporarily becomes a better conductor of electricity. When a positive ora negative stimulus is emotionally arousing, it activates the autonomic nervous system,which triggers an increase in sweating, especially in the palms of the hands and in theﬁngers, as well as the soles of the feet. Both positive and negative stimuli can result in anincrease in arousal, triggering GSR. GSR measurement cannot reveal emotional valence, buthas to be integrated with other data sources in order to paint the full picture of emotion [ 55].The obtained results showed that “lip balm 1” was the best appreciated product; conversely,“lip balm 3” was least preferred. Thus, the PCA esters used as emollients—Octyldodecyl

“lip balm 3” was least preferred. Thus, the PCA esters used as emollients—OctyldodecylPCA adopted for “lip balm 1”, and Lauryl PCA for “lip balm 3”—showed highly signiﬁcantdifferences in their unconscious effects. The authors supposed that the different chemicalstructures—i.e., the length of the alcoholic part of the esters’ aliphatic chains—had adifferent impact on peripheral receptors, such as tactile receptors and nociceptors, amongothers [ 55].In this context, the recent work by Sgoifo et al. (2021) indicates how a cosmeticroutine can also be considered to be a way of helping stress resilience. In particular, thestudy suggests that a good strategy for ﬁghting stress, obtaining long-lasting physio-

Neurocosmetic IngredientsNeurocosmetic functional ingredients can be formulated in different cosmetic formstargeted for every consumer’s skin type and age. Some of the marketed neurocosmeticingredients are thus discussed in the following section, focusing on anti-aging skincareingredients, and to better understand their mechanisms of action, a brief insight into theaffected biological pathways will also be presented.In detail, the functional neurocosmetic ingredients for ﬁghting skin aging will bepresented, starting from neurocosmetics indicated for use against skin stress manifesta-tions, followed by neurocosmetic ingredients speciﬁcally suitable for sensitive skin types.
Finally, Botox-like peptides or plant extracts are also explored. The principal functionalneurocosmetic ingredients used on the market are reported in Table 1, carefully detailingthe related features useful for their use.

Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 22 of 804.1. Neurocosmetic Ingredients for Combating Skin StressThe cosmetic strategies to combat skin stress are different, and neurocosmetic ingredi-ents can be suitable for this purpose.4.1.1. Skin Stress and the Stress Pathway: The Role of CortisolIn modern life, stress is deﬁned as the body’s response to a whole range of externaland psychological factors that disrupt homeostasis [ 71–73].Pollution, UV radiation, blue light, insufﬁcient sleep, social media, relationships,work-related worries, and the high number of working hours are just some of the everydaymodern stressors [ 37].In 1946, the endocrinologist Hans Selye proposed the term “stress” to describe a set ofsignals that he noticed in his patients [ 72]. Indeed, as reported in the literature, there arepieces of evidence that psychological stress could encourage some skin diseases—such asacne, psoriasis, dermatitis, or rosacea—or, in other cases, promote hair loss [ 72,74–76].
Persons’ moods, emotions, and sensations occur in the brain; subsequently, the brainsends biochemical signals to the body, including the skin, producing physiological ef-fects [ 72,74,77].If the exposure to stress is prolonged, skin cells do not stop the production of cortisol,also known as the stress hormone; thus, its levels remain elevated, causing a cascade ofdamaging consequences [ 65,66,71,72]. In this regard, the breakdown of skin homeostasistakes place, inducing inﬂammation and a visibly tired look [ 56]. Only when a feedbackmechanism is established does the body return to normal physiological conditions: thestress hormones and the related consequences are eliminated, restoring homeostasis [ 56,78].This is the ﬁeld in which neurocosmetics could act.In particular, as previously asserted, the skin and the brain are in communication forcoordinating external and internal “danger” signals by cytokines, chemokines, neurotrans-mitters, and neurohormones.
mitters, and neurohormones.With particular regard to cortisol, its release is mediated by the brain through thehypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal gland axis. Since the origin of the skin and the brain isthe same, skin cells are also able to induce cortisol production if stimulated by externalstress factors [ 56,76,78,79].The enzyme 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11 β-HSD1) converts inactivecortisone into biologically active cortisol and, as a result, under conditions of stress, thelevels of cortisol in the skin increase, driving collagen to atrophy and reducing cell growth.In aged and UV-exposed skin, cortisol production is more pronounced due to theupregulated 11 β-HSD1 levels. The more stress that people feel, the more their cortisollevels increase, initiating a possible cycle in which the visible stress signs on the skinencourage a physiological stress response inside the body (Figure 2).

Diagram of the stress pathway.More speciﬁcally, some of the negative effects of cortisol can be summarized as follows:• Increased blood sugar levels, which promote “glycation” in the skin, damaging col-lagen and elastin. As a result, long-term aging and loss of the skin’s ability to fullybounce back are accelerated;• Due to the strong catabolic effect of cortisol, the degradation of dermal proteins occurs;• Skin dryness due to the reduction in the production of hyaluronic acid—a naturalmoisturizer for our skin, associated with an increase in transepidermal water loss(TEWL);• Increase in the appearance of ﬁne lines and wrinkles, thinning skin, reduced elasticity,and lower skin barrier functionality [ 72,80].Some studies also reported that psychological stress induces less effective skin barrierrepair [ 81,82]. Furthermore, elevated concentrations of cortisol can disrupt epidermalcohesion [ 82].
cohesion [ 82].It was also demonstrated that the increase in cortisol levels could affect the epidermalbarrier in a reconstructed human model; this was attributed to a decrease in forkheadbox O3 (FOXO3) mRNA expression. FOXO3 is a gene involved in longevity and senes-cence [ 83,84]. In detail, Meyrignac et al. (2019) performed experiments using a recon-structed epidermal model with signs of senescence by knocking down FOXO3 [ 85,86]. Thisknockdown of FOXO3 damaged the epidermal cohesion by reducing the expression levelof claudin-1 ( −27.4%) and e-cadherin ( −18.2%)—two essential proteins for the integrity ofthe epidermal barrier. The authors also studied the impact of the combined effects of UVBirradiation and FOXO3 knockdown [ 83–86].From these considerations, some of the damages induced by stress are evident. There-fore, awareness about the impact of stress on facial skin is a topic growing in importance. In
particular, young people recognize the link between the anxieties they feel and their appear-ance. According to an online study conducted by Lightspeed GMI/Mintel on 2000 users,58% of people aged between 9 and 21 years agree that stress affects facial appearance.Thus, new and inspiring stress-rebalancing skincare formulations should be consid-ered [ 72].In other words, the question is: is it possible that a cosmetic routine could help theskin to balance cortisol levels for reducing stress, with immediate and long-lasting effects?The answer is in the use of neurocosmetics for combating skin stress.
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 24 of 80Neurocosmetic Ingredients for Rebalancing Cortisol Levels in the SkinFor years, the company DSM studied the link between cortisol, 11 β-HSD1 enzymeactivity, and skin homeostasis, contrasting one of the factors involved in visibly acceleratedskin aging. The result is Bel-Even®, a new DSM-patented molecule that reversibly inhibitsthe 11β-HSD1 enzyme [ 87,88]. It is formulated for skincare applications to rebalancecortisol levels in the skin, improving the skin barrier, elasticity, and density. As claimed onthe DSM webpage for Bel-Even®, and in the corresponding brochure [ 87], its effectivenesswas studied by using ex vivo studies on human skin cell cultures. For this purpose, the cellsamples were subjected to stress, measuring the cortisol levels in both the control sampleand the sample treated with Bel-Even®. The ﬁrst of these studies was related to the use of
samples stressed via UV irradiation, and the results showed that Bel-Even®, by inhibitingthe 11β-HSD1 enzyme, avoided the UV-induced type III collagen damage. The secondtest used cortisone as the stressor agent, revealing that, in unprotected skin, cortisone wasconverted to active cortisol; conversely, by adding the active ingredient Bel-Even®to cells,the transformation of cortisone to cortisol was inhibited.However, in both stress tests, the Bel-Even®mechanism of action rebalanced cortisollevels by inhibiting the enzyme 11 β-HSD1, and the results were particularly evidentin keratinocytes and ﬁbroblasts [ 87,88]. With the aim of performing in vivo tests, facialmeasurements of skin elasticity, density, and skin barrier strength (TEWL) were alsoconsidered. Interestingly, the facial skin elasticity appeared to be improved by 15.7% after12 weeks of 1% Bel-Even®application when compared with the placebo. Furthermore, the
active ingredient signiﬁcantly increased the skin density after 4 and 12 weeks, thanks to theincreased protein content in the dermis, mainly referring to collagen production [ 87,88].4.1.2. “Neuro-Relaxing” Anti-Aging IngredientsThe β-Endorphins: A Strategy for Skin WellnessAs previously said, if stress situations can cause imbalance in skin homeostasis, onthe other hand, positive touch, such as massage or hugs, could induce the release ofneurotransmitters that cause feelings of comfort and protection [ 89].To better understand this condition, it should be remembered that the skin is a sourceof the opioid β-endorphins—neurotransmitter peptides produced at the central nervoussystem level that induce analgesia (absence of pain) [ 90,91]. In detail, by acting on thecentral and peripheral opioid receptors, β-endorphins inhibit the transmission signals vianervous cells from the source of the pain (nociceptor) to the spinal cord. Thus, endorphins,
due to their connections with the brain’s “pleasure centers”, generate euphoric feelingswhen binding to the opiate receptors. Moreover, β-endorphins also bind their receptorsto immune system cells; they seem to be involved in the ﬁne-tuning of the immuneresponse. β-Endorphin receptors are expressed in skin cells. In this particular case, it isdemonstrated that β-endorphins can accelerate skin regeneration and wound healing. Inhuman keratinocytes, it has been conﬁrmed that the presence of a β-endorphin/ µ-opiatereceptor system is related to keratinocyte differentiation, the wound healing process, andmigration [ 89–93].As a result, this complex β-endorphin/ µ-opiate qualitatively improves the skin’sappearance [ 7].Bigliardi et al. (2002) showed the involvement of the skin’s β-endorphins in communi-cation with peripheral nerve endings [ 94]. The authors reported that keratinocytes positive
forβ-endorphin staining are clustered around the terminal ends of afferent C-ﬁbers, whichsignal the sensations of warmth, cold, or pain to the central nervous system. Moreover,the authors described the µ-opiate receptor as being expressed in the dermis and epider-
signal the sensations of warmth, cold, or pain to the central nervous system. Moreover,the authors described the µ-opiate receptor as being expressed in the dermis and epider-mis nerve ﬁbers. It has been supposed that keratinocytes can communicate directly withthe nervous system due to the opiate receptor system; hence, this should open potentialtherapies for skin diseases—for example, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis [ 94].Another interesting aspect regarding β-endorphin synthesis is POMC processing.As discussed before, endogenous opioids—a group of peptide hormones that include
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 25 of 80β-endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins—are produced by our body. They share theN-terminal amino acid sequence Tyr–Gly–Gly–Phe–X (X = Met or Leu), necessary to bindto the opioid receptor [ 95]. The proopiomelanocortin (POMC)—a protein that contains267 amino acid residues—is a precursor of these peptide hormones, and β-endorphin isone of them, originating from its cleavage [ 95–98]. Among other peptide hormones derivedfrom POMC, it is worth mentioning the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)—also knownas corticotropin, which stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete the anti-inﬂammatory andanti-allergic hormone cortisol—and the melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), whichis involved in skin pigmentation [ 99,100]. Generally, the POMC and the related cleavageproducts are produced mainly in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland’s anterior lobe,but the in situ production of POMC and its products (ACTH, MSH, β-endorphins, and
their corresponding receptors) has also been revealed in skin cells [ 97,99,101]. Indeed, it hasbeen proposed that the cutaneous POMC system acts in an autocrine manner in responseto external or internal stresses, evidencing the effect of opioids on skincare and presentingthe necessity of “neuro-relaxing” cosmetic ingredients derived from plant extracts, suitablefor the formulation of anti-aging products [ 102–106].Discovering Neurocosmetic Ingredients from Plant ExtractsTo ensure skin regeneration and vitality, MIBELLE BIOCHEMISTRY developedHappybelle-PE, a Vitex agnus-castus extract encapsulated in a double delivery systemdesigned to control the release of phyto-endorphins along with their bioavailability inorder to obtain anti-aging beneﬁts and radiant skin [ 107–110].The chaste tree ( Vitex agnus-castus ), also known as monk’s pepper, is a medicinalplant from the Mediterranean area and Asia that produces aromatic berries rich in phyto-
endorphins. These compounds bind to the µ-opiate receptor, stimulating the in vivoproduction of β-endorphins, thus offering beneﬁts for skincare [ 111–115].These dried monk’s pepper berries are treated in ethanol, glycerin, and β-cyclodextrin.The ﬁnal ingredients consist of monk’s pepper berry extract, lecithin, tocopherol (vitaminE), ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate (vitamin C-ester), and β-cyclodextrin. The combined use of β-cyclodextrin and lecithin leads to a double vector system: the hydrophobic monk’s pepperberries are hosted in the β-cyclodextrin cavity, and these complexes are enclosed in thelecithin liposomes; the lipophilic vitamins are encapsulated in a nanoemulsion, stabilizedwith lecithin [ 107,109,112,116]. The in vitro studies showed that the complex stimulated thecell activity and increased the production of type I and III collagens [ 109]. Another in vitrostudy performed on human keratinocyte cells has shown that Happybelle-PE favors cell
proliferation [ 109], while, in vivo tests demonstrated the increase in skin hydration (up to28% within 28 days), skin ﬁrmness (up to 20%), and the decrease in the wrinkle depth ofcrow’s feet (by more than 20%) [ 89,107,109–111].The phyto-endorphin complex extracted from the berries of the Vitex agnus-castusshrub also characterizes the JOYDERM cosmetic line. In this case, the phyto-endorphin com-plex acts topically to improve skin hydration, cell vitality, skin regeneration, and melano-genesis regulation—essential for skin wellbeing and preventing skin aging [ 114,117,118].With Happy Skin, PROVITAL discovers Rhodiola rosea root extract’s beneﬁts tostimulate the production of β-endorphins in the skin, granting it a more glowing appear-ance [ 119–121].NUXE cosmetic company dedicated part of its studies to the formulation of the cos-metic line Nirvanesque, which shows the “neuro-relaxing” properties of Paeonia suffruticosa
extract. Interestingly, NUXE performed its researches by adopting a “reverse pharmacog-
metic line Nirvanesque, which shows the “neuro-relaxing” properties of Paeonia suffruticosaextract. Interestingly, NUXE performed its researches by adopting a “reverse pharmacog-nosy” approach. By considering that the skin releases enkephalins through nerve ﬁbers,NUXE Laboratories established that enkephalins are the molecules of skin relaxation [ 5],being able to reduce stress messages. Starting from these considerations, the aim was toﬁght the appearance of the “stress”-related expression of microcontractions and wrinkles.Unfortunately, enkephalins exhibit a very short lifetime (about 20 seconds), because theenkephalinase enzymes rapidly destroy them [ 122]. Thus, intending to extend the lifetime
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 26 of 80of enkephalins, NUXE performed a screening of 165,000 plants, identifying those containinga sufﬁcient amount of pentagalloyl glucose (PGG)—the molecule able to inhibit the activityof enkephalinases [ 123–125]. This approach allowed them to ﬁnd Paeonia suffruticosa (treepeony), a perennial plant with large blooming ﬂowers that originally comes from Tibet,but it is also found in Europe, and has been used in traditional Chinese pharmacopeia formore than a millennium. Its root is collected in the fall, dried under the sun, and used rawor roasted [ 123,126,127]. Thus, NUXE began to produce the tree peony root concentratedextract (with patent pending), in blend with blue lotus seed, poppy seed, and althea root,resulting in Nirvanesque, which exhibited a double neurocosmetic action: a “Botox-like”booster for reducing skin’s micro-tensions (wrinkles), and an enkephalinase inhibitor [ 128].
LANC ÔME has created the exclusive NeuroCalm ™, a complex rich in Peonia suffruti-cosa ( Paeonia Suffruticosa extract/ Paeonia Suffruticosa root extract), French rose ( Rosa gallicaextract/ Rosa gallica ﬂower extract), Crithmum maritimum extract, and Moringa ( Moringapterygosperma seed extract) extract introduced in the Hydra Zen cream, formulated to neu-tralize the effects of environmental stress on the skin. The Hydra Zen “Antistress” soothingday cream moisturizes, nourishes, and protects facial skin from external aggressions suchas wind and air conditioning, which can promote its dehydration. Thanks to its soft texture,suitable for all skin types (very dry, dry, normal, mixed, oily, impure, mature, or sensi-tive), the cream is rapidly absorbed, leaving a soft, smooth, and radiant skin face [ 129].GIVAUDAN performed a speciﬁc extraction process for obtaining a concentrated extractenriched in speciﬁc sugars, including stachyose and ciceritol, from the seeds of Tephrosia
purpurea [89,130,131], creating Neurophroline ™[78]; it is designed to combat the multiplestress source effects present daily [ 56,130,132]. In detail, Neurophroline ™works to reducethe production of cortisol by skin cells ( −70% within 2 h, in vitro ) and to stimulate the re-lease ofβ-endorphins (+163% within 24 h, in vitro ). Moreover, when human keratinocytesand ﬁbroblasts were incubated with Neurophroline ™at 1%, a signiﬁcant stimulation inthe gene expression involved in the skin cells’ homeostasis was observed. Speciﬁcally,Neurophroline ™(1%), in both keratinocytes and ﬁbroblasts cells, if incubated for 24 or48 h ( in vitro ), promoted the expression of the major marker proteins involved in cellularstress response and oxidative stress, i.e., the heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) (up to 3000%),and the NADPH quinone dehydrogenase (NQO1) (200%). In ex vivo tests, the actionof Neurophroline ™on the production of the HMOX1 and NQO1 proteins was studied
using reconstructed human epidermis (RHE). RHE was topically treated for 2 days withNeurophroline ™at 1% in a placebo formula, or with positive controls. To quantify theexpressed amounts of HMOX1 and NQO1, the RHE was then analyzed by immunoﬂuo-rescence assay [ 78]. As a result, an improvement of the epidermal matrix, the reductionof inﬂammation and redness (by boosting HMOX1 up to 888%), and the stimulation ofnatural superoxide scavenger activity for advanced antioxidant and pollution protection(increases NQO1 up to 528% within 2 days) were observed [ 89].Neuphroline’s in vivo efﬁcacy was also demonstrated: within 2 weeks, Neurophro-line™signiﬁcantly recovered volunteers’ skin color and luminosity, even when tested inpolluted environments, and visibly reduced the signs of stress after one month of use. Inparticular, dark circles, eye bags, and the appearance of redness were reduced, conﬁrming
its fast action on stress relief [ 78,89]. Due to these properties, Neurophroline ™can be usedto formulate anti-aging night and day creams, antistress/fatigue serums, and eye care
its fast action on stress relief [ 78,89]. Due to these properties, Neurophroline ™can be usedto formulate anti-aging night and day creams, antistress/fatigue serums, and eye careproducts [ 78].GIV AUDAN proposed the same T ephrosia Purpurea seed extract to formulate body sculpt-ing products—such as Betaphroline, which stimulates the re lease ofβ-endorphins [ 56,133].4.1.3. Neurocosmetics as a Strategy to Combat Inﬂammatory Responses Related toSkin StressIt has been reported that the constant exposure to stress affects NF- κB (nuclear factorkappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) transcription factor in skin keratinocytes,increases cytokines, chemokines, and inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS), promotescell inﬂammation, redness, dehydration, and dull skin tone, and worsens rosacea-prone
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 27 of 80skin [ 89,134–137]. To reduce (up to 10% in vivo ) the skin inﬂammation and redness in-duced by stress, PROVITAL launched Agascalm, a ﬂower/leaf/stem extract derived fromAgastache mexicana , to provide a solution for inhibiting the release of cytokines (up to104% in vitro ) and the movement of NF- κB transcription factor to the nucleus (up to 70%in vitro ) [138–140]. Additionally, the improvement of vascular tonicity and the restorationof the skin’s moisture barrier (reducing water loss up to 13% in vivo ) are other beneﬁts.More youthful skin radiance and skin tone for a more uniform complexion are furthereffects [ 89].To boost skin comfort by reducing inﬂammation, Sepicalm S WP and Sepicalm VGWP (both Seppic)—derived from Nymphaea alba ﬂower extract, combined with amino acidsand minerals—are presented to soothe irritation, calm redness, and relieve any stinging
sensation [ 141,142]. These ingredients work by limiting the transcription factors necessaryfor the expression of inﬂammatory genes, reducing inﬂammation on both the dermal andepidermal skin layers by reducing IL-6 and IL-8 (key inﬂammatory mediators) and theirexpression, and by favoring the skin’s production of β-endorphins. The in vivo test resultsshowed an overall soothing effect and an improvement in skin radiance [ 89,143].4.1.4. Intriguing Hints about Sleep-Related Beauty: The Melatonin Receptor MT1It was reported that the melatonin receptor, MT1, is related to sleep and beauty. In thisregard, for example, the relationship between atopic dermatitis and sleep disorders is welldocumented [ 144,145]. Disorders of the circadian rhythms can locally affect melatonin syn-thesis in the skin. Indeed, poor sleep efﬁciency is associated with increased cortisol-inducedstress reactivity. Consequently, skin inﬂammation is caused by destroying the collagen
content and reducing the skin’s blood ﬂow efﬁciency, producing a subsequent decrement ofoxygen and amounts of nutrients. The eyes are particularly affected, manifesting dullnessand dark circles, making the skin look older [ 146–149].Several articles reported the connection between beauty sleep—understood as analternative to the alteration of circadian rhythms—and skincare ingredients via the skin–brain connection, based on their studies on the activity of melatonin and its receptor MT1in skin cells [ 150–152].In particular, a study presented at the 25th IFSCC conference on “CosmEthic Scienceand Conscience”, (Milan, 30 September–2 October, 2019) tested the efﬁcacy of a topicalformulation with sunﬂower stem cell extract ( Helianthus annuus cell culture extract, HACCE;rich in ﬂavonoids, polyphenols, and “phyto-melatonin”) as an alternative to melatonin, bymonitoring notable in vitro parameters in stressed and unstressed cells (such as melatonin
MT1 receptor gene expression, antioxidant activity, mitochondrial cell membranes, and soon), observing many clinical beneﬁts related to the skin–brain connection, stress reduction,and improved skin quality. Overall, HACCE extract exhibited very promising results:in vitro studies using HACCE at 0.002% as an optimal concentration were performed inorder to evaluate melatonin MT1 receptor gene expression in cells in the absence of stress(estimated about +130%), and in the presence of UV radiation (estimated about +117%)as a stressor. The means of MT1 signaling was studied, observing a reduction ( −99%) incyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in forskolin-stimulated cells and a consequentdecrease in adenylyl cyclase activity. Furthermore, in vitro antioxidant activity tests werealso performed: SOD and catalase gene expression in ﬁbroblasts were quantiﬁed by ELISAin the absence of stress and under UV irradiation, observing similar activities in all different
antioxidative enzymes (SOD 1, 2, and catalase).In vitro experiments on mitochondrial cell membranes and mitochondrial cells stressed
antioxidative enzymes (SOD 1, 2, and catalase).In vitro experiments on mitochondrial cell membranes and mitochondrial cells stressedby H 2O2were also objects of the study. In particular, by using HACCE at 0.002%, an ROS(reactive oxygen species) reduction in stressed cells of about −18% and −26%, respectively,was observed.Finally, in the in vitro experiments on the extracellular matrix, an increase in the typeI and III collagen gene expression (+42% and +31%, respectively, by ELISA quantiﬁcation),
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 28 of 80and a matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1) gene expression decrease ( −17%), were alsoobserved when applying a HACCE concentration ﬁxed at 0.002%.The HACCE “antistress” melatonin-like activity was also demonstrated by performingin vivo experiments. Female volunteers of self-described stressed conditions applied aproduct formulated with HACCE 2 times daily. Their stress levels were recorded by astressometer and measured by an endpoint datum, which showed a signiﬁcant decreasein stress index after using a 1% HACCE complex for 1 month. Thus, the activation of theMT1 receptor in the skin could safely reinforce its natural defense responses by attenuatingthe aging-associated stress signs; this promotes skin repair and beauty, demonstrating theskin–brain connection [ 153].4.2. Neurocosmetic Ingredients for Sensitive Skin4.2.1. Neuro-Sensitization of the SkinThe concept of “sensitive skin” is a complex dermatological condition deﬁned by
abnormal sensory symptoms. According the International Forum for the Study of Itch (IFSI),sensitive skin is deﬁnable as follows: “a syndrome deﬁned by the occurrence of unpleasantsensations (stinging, burning, pain, pruritus, and tingling sensations) in response to stimulithat normally should not provoke such sensations. These unpleasant sensations cannotbe explained by lesions attributable to any skin disease. The skin can appear normal orbe accompanied by erythema. Sensitive skin can affect all body locations, especially theface” [ 154]. Approximately half of the population considers their skin to be sensitive,mainly women [ 155–157]. Three main types of sensitive skin can be considered, and as awhole, their manifestations could be ascribed to reduced barrier functions, inﬂammationwith an intact barrier function or, commonly, to healthy individuals having skin thatoverreacts to environmental factors (wind, pollution, UV , temperature changes, and so on),
detergents, cosmetics, or clothes [ 155].These reactions can range from slight discomfort to frequent visible skin irritationsigns, such as redness. In detail, the adverse reactions refer to objective/visible andsubjective/sensory symptoms—for example, tightness, stinging, burning, and tingling, orsometimes pain, itching, and discomfort [ 155,158–161].Thus, it appears that these manifestations involve cutaneous nerve ﬁbers [ 162–164]due to the overactivation of transient receptor potential (TRP)-type receptors in the skin,which leads to constant inﬂammation and local redness. In detail, with regard to TRPreceptors, the attention should be focused on the transient receptor potential ion channelssubfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) involved in neuroinﬂammation. [ 165–169].The Molecular Basis of Sensitive Skin: TRPV-1-Mediated NeuroinﬂammationIt is known that an important role in the transduction of pain from a variety of envi-
ronmental stimuli is played by TRP channels—in particular, the TRPV1 vanilloid receptor.This receptor responds to different irritant stimuli—such as temperature (heat), pH (acids),and some chemical compounds (for example capsaicin)—by opening the transmembranechannel, allowing the inﬂux of Ca2+ions inside the cell [155,163,170,171].The result is theactivation of the signaling pathway, which promotes the release of neuromediators able toinduce inﬂammation, pain, and itching sensations [ 155,166,171].In general, TRPV1 receptors are largely present in sensory nerve cells, but it is worthremembering that they are also expressed in keratinocytes and ﬁbroblasts [ 155,166,172,173].Since the keratinocytes are the ﬁrst cell types exposed to external stimuli, they canquickly induce the pain signal to the underlying nerve cells. In sensitive skin, an increase inthe nervous response to harmless environmental inﬂuences is often due to an overreaction
of the TRPV1 receptor, attributable to the lower activation threshold and higher expressionlevels of TRPV1 [ 163,167,174].
of the TRPV1 receptor, attributable to the lower activation threshold and higher expressionlevels of TRPV1 [ 163,167,174].Interestingly, TRPV1 also plays a role in skin aging. Indeed, it was shown that inphoto-aged human skin, TRPV1 is usually overexpressed [ 170,175,176]. Furthermore, theconstant activation of TRPV1 caused, for example, by heat and/or infrared radiation, leads
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 29 of 80not only to inﬂammation, but also to the upregulation of enzymes that destroy collagen inthe skin, inducing premature skin aging [ 155,175,177–179].The inﬂammation process develops through the classical pathway that involves therelease of cytokines (interleukins), with visible effects, and neuroinﬂammation perceiveddifferently by each subject. When external factors interact with the skin, as the ﬁrststep, the keratinocytes release interleukin-1 α(IL-1α), provoking an immediate inﬂam-matory response [ 89,180,181]. As the second step, the keratinocytes communicate withneuron ﬁbers through the nerve growth factor (NGF) (overexpressed during inﬂammationprocesses, [ 27]), which activates a speciﬁc receptor—the tropomyosin receptor kinase A(trkA)—which, in turn, interacts with the TRPV1 receptor, enhancing its expression levelsat the surface of the nerve ﬁbers [ 182–185].Since TRPV1 controls the release of neuropeptides and delays the recovery of the
skin barrier function, the diffusion of many inﬂammatory mediators occurs. Thus, in-creased sensitivity of nociceptors to noxious stimuli manifests, leading to long-term skinsensitivity [ 167,186].Moreover, all of the stress effects discussed so far are worsened by aging and lack ofsleep [ 166].TRPV1 receptor activation is also involved in atopic skin (atopic dermatitis)—achronic inﬂammatory disease with a prevalence of 25% during childhood and 7–10%in adults [186–188]. Atopic dermatitis is a skin physiopathology caused by to impairedskin barrier function and neurogenic inﬂammation, which manifests as signiﬁcant skindryness and red spots frequently covered by small vesicles (small “bubbles”) that causea strong itching (85% of subjects) [ 189]. It is really the activation of TRPV1 that increasesoxidative stress and causes itching and burning sensations. Indeed, by blocking TRPV1,the skin barrier function improves [ 188,190,191]. Thus, a possible solution for sensitive
skin is to strengthen the tolerance level by reducing the reactivity of TRPV1 [ 155,186,190].4.2.2. Providing Solutions for Sensitive Skin: Neurocosmetic IngredientsPerfect skin is a common consumer desire. However, this goal is not easily achievable,because several “stressors” exist that render the skin tone irregular. For these reasons,there is a strong need for functional cosmetic ingredients that protect the skin. As anexample, Mariliance ™by GIVAUDAN is claimed to be a “neuro-soothing” extract de-rived from Rhodosorus marinus, a red microalga [ 89,158,162,185,192,193]. In order to assessthe sensitivity of skin towards external stimuli, in vitro tests using Mariliance ™demon-strated that it downregulates TRPV1 expression in astrocytes and inhibits the release ofneuroinﬂammatory mediators, with particular reference to IL-1 αand NGF [ 162,166].This product’s efﬁcacy through the skin layers was further evaluated by performing
ex vivo and in vitro penetration tests. In particular, its capacity for reducing skin sensitivitywas demonstrated by using the clinical evaluation of capsaicin. Mariliance ™signiﬁcantlydecreased the pain sensation, and 100% of panelists conﬁrmed that a cream containing thisingredient at 3%, soothes and softens the skin by inducing a general feeling of comfort.Thus, thanks to these properties, Mariliance ™can be used to formulate day creams, coldcreams, after-sun products, and shampoos for sensitive skin, and is also suitable forformulating post-depilatory, post-peeling, and after-shaving cosmetic products [ 162,192].MIBELLE BIOCHEMISTRY proposes Pinolumin, an extract from Swiss stone pinewood that contains high amounts of pinosylvin , a stilbenoid resveratrol-like molecule [ 194].The idea of its use as a “neuro-relaxing” ingredient in cosmetic products derived frominteresting research demonstrating that, when sleeping in a Swiss stone pine bed, the pine
The idea of its use as a “neuro-relaxing” ingredient in cosmetic products derived frominteresting research demonstrating that, when sleeping in a Swiss stone pine bed, the pinewood stimulates relaxation during deep sleep phases and reduces the heart rate [ 195–197].More detailed studies about its action mechanism showed that the Swiss stone pineextract inhibits the TRPV1 receptor, protects skin collagen by preventing the UVA-inducedproduction of MMP-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-1, a collagen-degrading enzyme), andreduces the production of inﬂammatory markers during oxidative stress, as well as localredness and age spots [ 198,199].
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 30 of 80Oxidative stress induced by ROS—generally caused by pollution, UV light, or agingprocesses—leads to inﬂammation and, consequently, skin redness. The exposure to UV lightupregulates MMP-1 and stimulates melanin overproduction, resulting in the formationof age spots [ 200,201]. Pinosylvin not only neutralizes free radicals by upregulating hemeoxygenase-1, but also reduces the amounts of intra- and extracellular ROS. Furthermore, byinhibiting inﬂammatory gene expression, pinosylvin reduces skin inﬂammatory responsesand neuroinﬂammation [ 199,202].Swiss stone pine extract’s ability to modulate sensory neuron activation was evaluatedin a cell culture model simulating the irritation of nerve endings due to TRPV1 receptoractivation. In particular, sensory neurons were irritated using capsaicin—a TRPV1 receptoragonist—both in the presence and absence (control) of Swiss stone pine extract. In the
case of irritated neurons, they reacted by releasing the calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP), provoking vasodilation and histamine release, along with activating inﬂammatorypathways. Meanwhile, in the presence of the Swiss stone pine extract, the dose-dependentCGRP release induced by capsaicin was reduced, suggesting a soothing effect. Indeed,in vivo studies demonstrated that Pinolumin, when present at 2%, improved skin tonehomogeneity, with a visibly radiant skin appearance [ 166,203].Skinasensyl®LS 9749 (liquid synthetic tetrapeptide) and Skinasensyl®LS 9852 (pow-dered synthetic tetrapeptide) from BASF are other two functional ingredients designedto soothe sensitive skin [ 204–206]. These ingredients improve skin comfort by reducingoverreactions that lead to burning and stinging [ 207]. Furthermore, both Skinasensyl®LS9749 and Skinasensyl®LS 9852 inhibit the release of the neuromediator CGRP from sensoryneurons, and increase the skin’s tolerance threshold [ 207–209].
With the aim of relieving sensitive skin, Wandrey et al. (2017) studied a bioinspiredpeptide from the analgesic component of sea anemone ( Heteractis crispa ) venom protein,proposing it as a novel neurocosmetic soothing ingredient, with interesting effects soonafter the ﬁrst application [ 210]. Interestingly, in the venom of the leathery sea anemone,scientists have discovered a small protein called analgesic polypeptide HC1 (APHC1),which was the ﬁrst polypeptide inhibitor of the TRPV1 receptor [ 211–213]. It was alsoshown that treatment with APHC1 improved the effects on the pain response in both acuteand chronic pain models [ 214]. Therefore, this protein is a very interesting molecule fortargeting TRPV1 to reduce irritation in sensitive skin [ 215].A supramolecular assembly made of a shea-butter-based soft sphere carrier sys-tem incorporating the peptide was proposed for improving the skin’s peptide uptake
and protecting it from degradation. An in vitro assay showed that this peptide reducedthe activation of the TRPV1 pain receptor. During clinical studies, the increase in theskin’s electrical current perception threshold (CPT)—measured using a Neurometer—alsodemonstrated its ability to decrease the skin’s reactivity and sensitivity towards an irritantstimulus; thus, the skin appears more resistant to environmental stresses [ 210,216].Thanks to the studies on the sea anemone protein, a pentapeptide (RRRFV) wasdesigned to mimic the TRPV1 binding sequence for formulating soothing cosmetic prod-ucts. The peptide was synthetically produced in order to respect sustainability and purityrequests, and the resulting soothing active ingredient SensAmone P5 by MIBELLE BIO-CHEMISTRY was obtained [ 217]. A placebo-controlled double-blind clinical study wasperformed on volunteers with sensitive skin in order to assess the related skin-comforting
properties via in vivo tests. In detail, a cream containing 2% SensAmone P5 was applied
performed on volunteers with sensitive skin in order to assess the related skin-comfortingproperties via in vivo tests. In detail, a cream containing 2% SensAmone P5 was appliedon one half of the subjects’ faces, while the corresponding placebo cream was applied onthe other half. The obtained results revealed that the single application of the 2% soothingactive ingredient increased the CPT, suggesting a reduced reactivity of the skin towardsexternal stimuli [ 210,218].Interestingly, Fatemi et al. (2016) identiﬁed the inhibitory effect of bPOMC—an inno-vative POMC-derived biomimetic tripeptide present in Neutrazen™, by LUCAS MEYERCOSMETICS—on humans’ sensory irritation induced by capsaicin. To improve its pene-tration and efﬁcacy, bPOMC was linked to a lipid [ 27]. The authors reported that bPOMC
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 31 of 80soothed irritated skin, and maintained and restored the sensitivity threshold of normalskin without affecting melanogenesis. It was concluded that the bPOMC reduced thecapsaicin-induced inﬂammation by limiting the release of substance P and preventing therelease of IL-1-induced IL-8 [ 27].These considerations can be better understood by considering that the skin is also a tar-get organ for POMC peptides, whose activities determine antagonism and downregulationof adhesion molecules and reduce inﬂammation by modulation of IL-10 production [ 121].POMC peptides are expressed by melanocytes, keratinocytes, ﬁbroblasts, microvascularendothelial, mast, Langerhans, and immune cells (monocytes and macrophages) [ 100].Thus, to organize the skin’s stress response system against local stress, the skin’s neuroen-docrine system—regulated by POMC peptides—should interact with the skin’s immunesystem [ 103,180].
system [ 103,180].In detail, the POMC peptides exert their effects through ﬁve subtypes of heterodimericG-protein-coupled receptors with seven transmembrane domains indicated as melanocortinreceptors (MC-1R through MC-5R) [ 96,100,110].During in vitro experiments, it has been observed that POMC binds to melanocortin-1receptor (MC1-R), reducing the production of interleukin 8 (IL-8)—a proinﬂammatorychemokine that is involved in the pathogenesis of some inﬂammatory skin diseases—without affecting melanogenesis [ 100,219,220].Experimental evidence revealed that both neuropeptides and neurohormones exertan important immunoregulatory role, and that the articulated cascade of mediators thatinteract with one another is involved in the physiopathology of sensitive skin. In particular,the latter refers to a nonspeciﬁc reaction that involves cutaneous sensory innervationthrough unmyelinated (C) or myelinated (A δ) ﬁbers that respond to a wide range of
chemical and physiological stimuli [ 27,176,221].For example, sensitivity to capsaicin is mediated by non-mechanosensory C ﬁbers,while during heat perception, mostly mechanosensory C ﬁbers and BC ﬁbers are in-volved [ 29,222].The application of capsaicin to the skin boosted the noxious stimuli: it binds to theTRPV1 receptor and activates the C nerve ﬁbers, resulting in the appearance of redness andlocal inﬂammation—a process called “neurogenic inﬂammation” [ 174]. Thus, starting fromthese considerations, this biomimetic peptide bPOMC should represent another strategy toinhibit sensory irritation [ 27]. For example, when used for formulating skincare products,bPOMC reduces the symptoms of contact dermatitis [ 110].It should be remembered that the POMC peptide chain, synthesized and released bykeratinocytes, contains the β-endorphin sequence which, in turn, contains enkephalin—apentapeptide composed of Tyr–Gly–Gly–Phe–Met/Leu, found near epidermal nerve end-
ings (Merkel cells) [ 100,223]. It has also been supposed that the anti-pruritic effectiveness ofopioids is due to their action on these nerve ﬁbers. Furthermore, cooperation between thecalcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and opioids in the suppression of the pain processcan also be considered: the main effect is centered on met-enkephalinergic neurons, whichrelease their opioids under the stimulation of CGRP . Some opioid peptides, synthesized byepidermal and nervous cells, can act at the CGRP-releasing sensory nerve level to sootheskin [ 29].Other interesting experimental studies reported that the endogenous dipeptide Tyr–Arg named kyotorphin, discovered in 1979, has receptors that activate calcium inﬂux (IP3gate) by releasing met-enkephalin, inducing analgesia [ 209,224,225]. However, kyotorphinis not suitable for cosmetic applications due to its hydrophilicity, which prevents it fromreaching the epidermis. Lintner et al. (2009) derivatized the peptide to improve its
bioavailability by synthesizing N-Acetyl–Tyr–Arg–Hexadecyl ester (NATAH) [ 29]. This
reaching the epidermis. Lintner et al. (2009) derivatized the peptide to improve itsbioavailability by synthesizing N-Acetyl–Tyr–Arg–Hexadecyl ester (NATAH) [ 29]. Thislipopeptide is commercially available from SEDERMA under the name Calmosensine [ 226].As a ﬁrst step of the study, human keratinocytes were incubated with different con-centrations of the NATAH peptide for 24 h, with the aim of investigating its pseudo-opioidability for upregulating the gene responsible for POMC synthesis. Indeed, the POMC
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 32 of 80increase, observed in the presence of the NATAH peptide, indicates an improved secre-tion of opioid derivatives such as the keratinocyte met-enkephalin. In a second step, theNATAH-mediated CGRP modulation was studied. During in vitro experiments, sensoryneurons spontaneously released CGRP into the culture medium. This phenomenon wasalso observed after stimulation with different stressors (capsaicin, for example), indicatingthe neuronal activation and the existence of action potential. With the NATAH peptide,marked desensitization was noted at a concentration of 5 ppm, reducing CGRP secretionto half its baseline value. As a result, it appears that NATAH has the proﬁle of a potentialsoothing and “relaxing” neurocosmetic ingredient [ 29].DEFENSIL®-SOFT by RAHN AG is a neuro-soother formulation based on the extractof an edible mushroom Albatrellus ovinus , and proposed as a functional ingredient [ 227].
Due to the presence of the bioactive phenolic compounds grifolin, neogrifolin, and scutig-eral in this extract, the effective inhibition of the TRPV1 receptor was observed duringin vitro studies [ 203,228,229]. Furthermore, when applied to the skin, DEFENSIL®-SOFTprovides soothing ( in vivo study) and anti-aging effects [ 230]. In detail, from in vivo andin vitro studies, it has been reported that DEFENSIL®-SOFT counteracts neuroinﬂamma-tion, reduces skin irritation, and soothes hyperalgesic skin, as well as preventing IR agingby protecting skin from IR-induced heat stress [ 227].On the whole, DEFENSIL®-SOFT delays intrinsic and extrinsic skin aging, as well asthermal aging, and resets the skin’s pain threshold.Based on the relatively recent scientiﬁc evidence that POMC-derived neuropeptidesexert anti-inﬂammatory activity in the skin through the binding to—and subsequent activa-tion of—MC1-R, LUCAS MEYER COSMETICS developed Neutrazen ™, a soothing lipopep-
tide derived from the α-MSH sequence, particularly suitable for sensitive skin [231,232];itis composed of three amino acids coupled with palmitic acid to help its absorption throughthe skin. Among the other biomimetic peptides tested in in vitro experiments, Neutrazen ™demonstrated a high binding afﬁnity for MC1-R (comparable to that of α-MSH), a weakmelanogenic activity, and the ability to counteract the skin’s inﬂammatory processes [ 27].Generally, the in vitro experiments showed that α-MSH downregulates the produc-tion of proinﬂammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- αand, conversely,upregulates the production of the cytokine synthesis inhibitor IL-10 [ 233–235]. Part of theanti-inﬂammatory effect seems to be mediated by the inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) at a molecular level. α-MSH binds MC1-R with a high afﬁnity, exerting anti-inﬂammatory activity, as conﬁrmed by experiments carried out using MC1-R-selective
synthetic agonists [ 236,237]. Many skin cells are targets for the anti-inﬂammatory effects ofα-MSH, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, keratinocytes, melanocytes,ﬁbroblasts, and endothelial cells [ 238]. Keratinocytes respond to external stimuli such asUV radiation by producing interleukins, which act as messengers mobilizing inﬂamma-tory cells. The ﬁrst cytokines to be released are IL-1 and TNF- α[103,239]. In the skin,interleukin-driven inﬂammatory reactions are a major cause of erythema (redness) andedema (swelling) [ 240,241]. In this regard, for example, Neutrazen ™reduces UVB-inducedinﬂammatory response, and consequently protects from the harmful effects of sun ex-posure. In vitro tests showed that in keratinocytes, it downregulates the production ofUVB-induced inﬂammatory cytokines such as interleukin 8 (IL-8), and in ﬁbroblasts in-hibits the release of IL-1-induced IL-8, reinforcing its anti-inﬂammatory potential. When

hibits the release of IL-1-induced IL-8, reinforcing its anti-inﬂammatory potential. Whentested ex vivo, Neutrazen ™inhibited neurogenic inﬂammation by reducing the effectsof substance P on skin explants. More speciﬁcally, the addition of Neutrazen ™to skinexplants reduces edema formation (by 60%), inhibits blood vessel dilation in the presenceof substance P , and prevents the release of TNF- αproduced during substance-P-inducedneurogenic inﬂammation. Knowing that neurogenic inﬂammation is linked to photo-aging,Neutrazen ™potentially also prevents the signs of premature aging of/on the skin. Clinicalstudies were performed to evaluate and compare the anti-inﬂammatory and anti-irritantefﬁcacy of a Neutrazen ™formulation when applied as preventive care or soothing care onchemically challenged skins. The chemical agent used for these tests was sodium dode-
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 33 of 80cyl sulfate (SDS)—an anionic surfactant—at a concentration of 0.5%. The results provedthat Neutrazen ™effectively reduces redness in SDS-challenged skin, and successfullyalleviated the signs of inﬂammation. Thus, it can be recommended for soothing care tomaintain a normal skin sensitivity threshold. Additionally, after performing consumertests, it appeared that Neutrazen ™quickly reduces sensations of burning, tingling, andirritated skin, soothes itching, and provides protection and skin comfort. Overall, visiblysmoother skin, reduced wrinkles, healthier and more radiant complexion, and an increasedinﬂammatory resistance were observed [ 242].4.2.3. Providing Solutions for Sensitive Skin: “Coolant” Neurocosmetic IngredientsAn Insight about the Skin Sensation: Warm and Cold ReceptorsCutaneous skin sensitivity refers to sensory inputs from the skin surface, and describes
the neurobiological processes that confer to the skin the ability to “sense.” When cosmeticproducts are applied onto the skin’s surface, the skin’s sensory neural architecture is highlyreceptive to different physicochemical forms of stimulation: the skin’s sensations can bedescribed by referring to touch, temperature, itch, and pain, which are related to differentreceptors [ 4]. In particular, these sensations, by traveling along different pathways, reachdifferent targets in the brainstem. The sensory information is thus represented in the brainin the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, where the contralateral body surfacesare mapped in each hemisphere.Focusing the attention on the effect that temperature could have on the skin, it is worthmentioning that the cutaneous somatosensory system can detect an impressive range oftemperature changes.The free nerve endings for cold- or warm-sensitive nervous ﬁbers are located beneath
the surface of the skin, and can sense temperature changes, not absolute temperature.Particularly, non-glabrous skin contains a system of nerves that speciﬁcally code for thepleasant properties of touch [ 4].The thermal stimuli that differ from the homeostatic condition excite speciﬁc temperature-sensory nerves in the skin, and transmit this change to the spinal cord and brain. There aretwo kinds of thermosensory ﬁbers: warm and cold receptors, which respond to warmthand cold, respectively. These receptors can be distinguished from nociceptors that respondto noxious low and high temperatures (<20◦C and >45◦C), and also from thermosensitivemechanoreceptors [ 4].In this ambit, the cooling ingredients—intended to work on a neurological level byeliciting a feeling of freshness—can be inserted and considered to be neurocosmetics. Oneof the ﬁrst and oldest coolant ingredients present on the market was menthol and, later, itsderivatives [ 243].
derivatives [ 243].With HydroSal™SalCool, SALVONA proposes a patented blend of cooling ingredientsthat act in a non-competitive way on the skin’s different sensory nerve endings, and conferthe pleasant sensation without adaptation phenomena [ 244]. HydroSal™SalCool is madeof submicron spheres with a diameter of approximately 0.1–0.3 µm, suitable to enhancethe products’ delivery to sensory nerves while avoiding bodily cooling. In particular, theslow release of the substances constituting this ingredient is optimized in order to obtaina long-lasting, enhanced, refreshing experience, without skin irritation. Furthermore, asdescribed in SALVONA’s brochures, this technology is suitable and safe for all differentskin types—even near the eyes [ 245].Similarly, GIVAUDAN provided a patented combination of cooling active ingredientsin Evercool Skin [ 246].In vitro /ex vivo tests demonstrated the activation of the cold sensa-
tion receptor TRMP8 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 8),while in vivo experiments proved a long-lasting cooling effect (also after 120 min from itsapplication to the skin) using it at 2% [ 47,247,248].
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 34 of 804.2.4. Soothing Neurocosmetic Products on the MarketSome neurocosmetic functional ingredients have been used for formulating sensitiveskincare products targeted not only to the mass market, but also to beauty centers or spas.Many examples are presented below:DOCTOR BABOR Intensive Calming Cream is claimed to soothe the manifestation ofneuro-sensitive, extremely sensitive, and very dry skin [ 249]; it relieves unpleasant feelingsof tightness and itching, aiming to obtain an even skin appearance. This product can also beused as a helpful skincare treatment for atopic eczema during symptom-free intervals [ 249].The active complex is Neuroxyl, made of gamma-linolenic acid from evening primrose oil,panthenol, and micro silver. Its action reduces irritation and redness and relieves itching.It promotes the regeneration of the skin’s natural protective barrier, and improves skinresistance and elasticity [ 250,251].
resistance and elasticity [ 250,251].Similarly, DOCTOR BABOR Neuro Sensitive Cellular Intensive Calming Cleanser isformulated with a Neuroxyl complex [ 249]; it is a mild, cleansing milk that replenisheslipids, speciﬁcally designed for extremely dry and sensitive skin; it reduces unpleasantitching and pulling sensations, promotes skin barrier regeneration, and improves the skin’ssmoothness and elasticity [ 249].Recently, due to the increased popularity of neurocosmetics, many brands workedto produce professional skincare products available in spas and beauty centers. ZensibiaNeoZen Mask, from ISABELLE LANCRAY, is one example; it is a soft leave-on mask thatcan be applied as a skincare cream, and is particularly indicated for aged, sensitive, anddry skin that presents redness. The Camellia sinensis leaf extract and ceramides contained inZensibia NeoZen Mask help to repair, reinforce, and protect the skin barrier. If, on the one
hand, the contained polyphenols (for example, magnolol), minerals, and micronutrientsexhibit antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory properties, on the other hand, the probioticingredients (Lactobacillus/Arundinaria gigantea ferment ﬁltrate, Leuconostoc/radishroot ferment ﬁltrate) ensure healthy skin ﬂora, and activate the skin’s natural immunesystem [ 252–255].The neurocosmetic ingredients palmitoyl tripeptide-8 (Neutrazen) and acetyl dipeptide-3 aminohexanoate (Bodyfensine by LIPOTEC) work to regenerate skin, reduce redness,and strengthen vein walls for a glowing skin appearance [ 256,257].Since sensitive skin needs special precautions, especially regarding the use of speciﬁccosmetic products that should not exacerbate the problems of this imperfection, interestedconsumers must be reassured in the conscious choice of the products that they will buy,even from a simple reading of the label—especially with regard to neurocosmetics.4.3. Neurocosmetic Ingredients for Skin Aging
4.3. Neurocosmetic Ingredients for Skin AgingOver the years, signiﬁcant anatomical and physiological changes at the skin level,which progressively decrease skin thickness, elasticity, tone, and chromatic uniformity, areobserved. Although the aging process is gradual, skin aging times and methods largelydepend on individual characteristics. The nature of the main causes that affect agingare genetic and environmental; for this reason, intrinsic aging and extrinsic aging aredistinguished, as well described in the literature [ 1,258–260].• Intrinsic (chronological) aging or chrono-aging.Intrinsic aging is linked to the subject’s age; it depends on complex physiologicalmechanisms involving a series of skin changes (exposed or not to sunlight), and is mani-fested through a slow process of tissue degeneration. If it is thought of as a phenomenonregarding a single individual, it can occur earlier or later depending on their genetic pre-
disposition, and hormonal levels can inﬂuence the thickness of the skin, the quantities ofcollagen, and its water content. When considering people of the same age and lifestyle, the
disposition, and hormonal levels can inﬂuence the thickness of the skin, the quantities ofcollagen, and its water content. When considering people of the same age and lifestyle, thesigns of aging appear more evident in women than in men due to the lower thickness ofthe female skin, their greater sensitivity to hormones, and their frequent expressiveness ofthe face. Furthermore, male skin is also richer in sebaceous glands that favor the forma-
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 35 of 80tion of a hydrolipidic ﬁlm containing more lipids, guaranteeing protection from externalagents [ 261–263].• Extrinsic agingExtrinsic aging is age-independent, and is associated with many features, includinglife behaviors, diseases, environmental pollution, and sunlight exposure (photo-aging).In particular, smoking, toxic substances, some drugs, and UV rays induce the release ofinﬂammatory mediators, the deactivation of the body’s natural defense systems, and theproduction of free radicals, with a consequent increase in the tendency for the manifestationof aging skin. Photo-aging mainly depends on the individual’s skin phototype, sunexposure time, use of sun-care products, and geographical position (by latitude, the sun’srays reach the ground with a different inclination) [ 261–263].4.3.1. Physiological and Morphological Characteristics of Aged SkinAmong the most frequent phenotypic manifestations of intrinsic and extrinsic ag-
ing, there are the onset of wrinkles at different depth levels, hyperkeratosis, reductionin the production of hydrolipidic ﬁlm (natural moisturizing factor, NMF), and modiﬁ-cations to the dermo–epidermal junction (basal membrane), dermis, hypodermis, andskin appendages. Moreover, melanin distribution is often inhomogeneous, and this fa-vors the formation of dyschromia and hyperpigmentation, especially at the level of thephoto-exposed areas [ 1,239,264].4.3.2. Skin Neuro-Aging and Neurocosmetic IngredientsSeveral studies have demonstrated that neuronal cells, like other cellular types, aresubject to aging, and this process is known as neurodegeneration [ 265].The latter process was deeply investigated, and the role of a neurotoxic peptide—amyloid-beta (A β)—involved in the formation of senile plaques on the surface of nerveendings has been highlighted [ 266]. This protein is obtained from the proteolytic cleavage
of the s-amyloid precursor protein (APP) [ 267,268]. The APP cleavage follows two differentenzymatic pathways: the amyloidogenic cleavage pathway, and the non-amyloidogenicpathway. In the ﬁrst enzymatic process, the β-secretase enzyme causes the generation ofneurotoxic A β, releasing the N-terminus of A βfrom APP , and a presenilin-dependentγ-secretase complex releases the C-terminus of A βfrom the membrane. In an alternative,non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP is processed by the α-secretase enzyme, generating anN-terminal fragment (the sAPP αpeptide), considered to be a potent neurotrophic factorwith neuroprotective properties [ 269–272].These two cleavage pathways exist in a balanced manner within a neuronal popu-lation that could be considered young. The aging process and oxidative stress lead toa gradual imbalance, in which the neurotoxin becomes dominant, enhancing the neuro-aging [ 271,272]. When exposed to neuro-aging, the messengers released by neurons affect
ﬁbroblasts’ viability, causing skin aging—neuro-aging promotes ﬁbro-aging [ 21,273,274].In this research ﬁeld, studies by CODIF demonstrated that neurons’ aging inﬂuences thecommunication between nerves and ﬁbroblasts, decreasing the vitality of collagen, elastin,and ﬁbroblasts, which visibly impacts the skin [ 89,261,275,276]. With this in mind, CODIFdeveloped the active ingredient Neuroguard, which targets the aging of nerve endings bystimulating the sAPP αneuroprotector, restoring the features of neurons not exposed toneuro-aging [ 275,276].While neurons not exposed to neuro-aging have active synapses, an extensive network,and integral cell nuclei, the neuro-aged ones show fragmented nerve endings, “burnt-out” nuclei, and a limited network [ 275,276].In vitro experiments demonstrated thatNeuroguard increased soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha production by 87% within24 h, protecting the neurons from neurodegeneration [ 89,275,276]. It is possible to say that
this ingredient has revolutionized the neurocosmetic world thanks to its mechanism of
24 h, protecting the neurons from neurodegeneration [ 89,275,276]. It is possible to say thatthis ingredient has revolutionized the neurocosmetic world thanks to its mechanism ofaction [ 276].
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 36 of 80Neuroguard is an oligosaccharide composed of guluronic and mannuronic acid, ob-tained via the enzymatic depolymerization of polysaccharides from the brown algae Lami-naria hyperborea and Lessonia nigrescens [275,276]. It was developed to re-establish healthycommunication between nerves and ﬁbroblasts and regenerate dermal cells weakened bythe “messenger of aging” [ 265,277,278]. Thanks to the reactivation of collagen and elastinsynthesis, Neuroguard can treat deep wrinkles within 28 days [ 275,279–282].As reported in CODIF’s brochure, Neuroguard can effectively protect neurons’ vi-ability when used both before neuro-aging begins, and when neuro-aging is already inprogress [ 275,283,284].Another interesting property of this active ingredient is its ability to protect neuronsagainst H 2O2toxicity (42% of protection). It has been reported that the high presenceof free radicals induces a gradual imbalance, more pronounced with age, between the
neuroprotector sAPP αand the neurotoxic A β[275,284,285]. Neuroguard’s neuroprotectiveproperties have been studied on both affected and unaffected nerve endings, observingpreventive and restorative effects towards ﬁbroblasts and extracellular matrices [ 89,265,280].Interestingly, by preserving the activity of the ﬁbroblasts from neuro-aging toxicity, thein vitro tests revealed that Neuroguard promoted the expression of genes coding for typeIII collagen (+40%), elastin (+17%), syndecan (+29%), laminin IV (+31%), and extracellularmatrix proteins [ 27,53] Tests performed in vivo showed a 25% reduction in the volume ofcrow’s feet wrinkles over 56 days for smoother skin (+ 11%) [ 89,275,280,281].In summary, in terms of cosmetic beneﬁts, Neuroguard’s neuroprotective actionprevents neuro-aging by protecting neurons from free radicals’ toxicity, stimulates thesynthesis of the neuroprotector sAPP α, restores a healthy communication between nerve
cells and ﬁbroblasts, protecting dermal cells from aging, and prevents ﬁbro-aging byprotecting and reactivating collagen and elastin synthesis [ 279,286,287].Neuroguard, especially for mature skin types, provides a speciﬁc anti-wrinkle solution,preventing and delaying cellular disorders [ 276].Glistin by BIOSIL TECHNOLOGIES is another interesting neurocosmetic functionalingredient that offers an original approach for cellular communication [ 288]. It is a pep-tide able to substitute the NGF, favoring nervous cells’ survival and development in theepidermis via NGF-like effects [ 289]. Indeed, while in the skin, nerve cells regulate theactivity of all cell types by secreting cytokines, keratinocytes, ﬁbroblasts, and adipocytes,which secrete NGF, ensuring the survival and development of nerve cells. With aging, themetabolism of all skin cells slows down. Keratinocytes, ﬁbroblasts, and adipocytes produce
less NGF; thus, nerve cells are unable to support the activities of other cells—especiallykeratinocytes. Starting from these considerations, a neuroprotection strategy should beadopted, and it should consist of:• The protection of nerve cells in the epidermis by providing good support for otherskin cells;• The maintenance of good barrier function in order to improve skin hydration (in theepidermis, nervous cells could stimulate the activity of keratinocytes, enhancing thebarrier function that, in turn, causes hydrated and protected skin);• The ﬁrming of skin by preserving the lipolytic activity in adipocytes. In the hypoder-mis, nervous cells stimulated the adipocytes’ lipolytic activity, which decreases withaging. By protecting nerve cells, good skin ﬁrmness is ensured [ 290].Furthermore, it is well known that skin changes exposed to different stresses can leadto a re-organization in the skin’s structures and reduce cellular communication, slowing
the cutaneous metabolism. In particular, cellular communication is present at all skin
to a re-organization in the skin’s structures and reduce cellular communication, slowingthe cutaneous metabolism. In particular, cellular communication is present at all skinlevels—in the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis—enabling cells to assist and supportone another. Some exchanges occur between different cell types belonging to the samecompartment, or between cells in different compartments. Therefore, it clearly appearsessential to maintain these exchanges at all levels.On these grounds, Glistin offers the solution to the problem, as a functional ingredientthat can protect the skin’s cellular communication from aging effects, maintain hydration,
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 37 of 80and give maximum comfort. This ingredient was speciﬁcally designed to target stem cellsin the epidermis, in order to stimulate their proliferation and increase their resistance toUV rays.Another peptide ingredient provided by BIOSIL TECHNOLOGIES is Glutrapep-tide [ 291]; its action mechanism is focused on cellular communication that involvesadipocytes and nerve cells at the hypodermis level. Glutrapeptide supports the activ-ity of adipocytes, and their related ability to eliminate fats by protecting nerve cells [ 291].As previously explained, when chronic stress occurs, cortisol levels increase, impactinghypodermis cells. In fact, since cortisol inhibits the production of NGF in adipocytes,neurodegeneration begins. As a result of neurodegeneration, neurons secrete less nore-pinephrine, which reduces lipolysis (the adipocytes’ ability to consume fats), and then
adipogenesis (the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature and functional adipocytes)is stimulated.Stress is thus responsible for the increasing number of adipocytes with a low fat-excretion capacity due to the effects of cortisol. Glutrapeptide’s action lies in preventingneurodegeneration by substituting for NGF, promoting the survival and development ofnerve cells in the hypodermis by increasing their capacity to excrete fats and inhibiting theeffects of cortisol on lipolysis; it is compatible with traditional lipolytic treatments, such ascaffeine, for a synergistic effect [ 290,292].Rethinking Skin Aging by Modulating Senescence Marker Proteins: The Case of ProgerinFor daily life and social wellbeing, the skin’s appearance and vitality have primaryimportance [ 261–263].It has been discovered that ﬁghting the signs of aging is not the only strategy toimprove skin appearance—the delaying of processes of senescence should also be rele-
vant [ 293]. Senescence refers to changes that occur in the biology of an organism duringthe aging process. In particular, the concept of cellular senescence indicates the loss ofnormal cells’ ability to divide, even if the cells are still active. Moreover, an increase in themetalloproteinase activity promoting extracellular matrix degradation arises [ 294–296].Senescent cells are also linked to progerin (from the Latin “progeria”; Greek “prema-ture old age”), a toxic protein deﬁned as an “aging biomarker” [ 297–299].During the cells’ aging process, the amount of progerin increases, inducing nucleardefects, DNA damage, and the appearance of signs of aging [ 293,298].Progeline ™by LUCAS MEYER [ 300], a three-amino-acid biomimetic peptide (tri-ﬂuoroacetyl tripeptide-2), was thus developed to improve wrinkles and sagging skin bymodulating progerin [ 301,302]. More speciﬁcally, this active compound decreases progerin
synthesis and accumulation, and inhibits metalloproteinases [ 297,303].In vivo tests performed using a cream containing 2% Progeline ™applied to the faceand neck, both in the morning and evening, for 56 days, demonstrated how the volume ofthe jawline decreases [ 302].Progeline ™, showing its efﬁcacy on skin slackness and sagging, reduces the appear-ance of wrinkles and increases skin ﬁrmness, elasticity, and viscoelasticity [ 300]. In otherwords, Progeline ™shows several properties: rebuilding collagen matrices, remodelingfacial contour lifting, improving skin micro-sculpture and architecture, lifting jawlines, andreducing drooping cheeks [ 302]. As a ﬁnal beneﬁt, the skin’s ﬂexibility and elasticity arerestored.Cell Communication Supports by Stimulating POMC-Related Receptor ExpressionCarli et al. (2016) reported that an excess of neuropeptides in the absence of receptorscould induce the cells’ desynchronization. For example, during aging processes in the

human epidermis, when the levels of the POMC neuropeptide in the keratinocytes rise,the melanocortin receptor-2 (MC-2R) and micro-opioid receptor 1 (MOR-1)—which arethe ACTH and β-endorphin receptors, respectively—decrease [ 100,112,304]. Hence, animbalance of communication between the nervous and skin cells occurs [ 89,305].
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 38 of 80BASF selected a neurocosmetic ingredient— Achillea millefolium extract, marketed asNeurobiox—able to upregulate receptor expressions [ 305–307]. The ingredient works forrebalancing communication, with the aim of improving cellular message transmission [ 89].BASF evaluated the Achillea millefolium extract’s effects on the different epidermal differenti-ation markers’ expression patterns during ex vivo studies performed on normal human skinbiopsies [ 306,307]. The Achillea millefolium extract’s properties for smoothing and rejuve-nating skin’s surface appearance were also evaluated during in vivo studies. The obtainedresults showed an improved expression of cytokeratin 10, transglutaminase-1, and ﬁlaggrin,and an increased epidermal thickness (+10%), cohesion, and regeneration [ 304,308].Another aspect in which the results of Neurobiox ’s use are interesting is some skin
defects due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as hormones, diet, and stress. Becauseof these, the skin can develop irregularities and lose its natural glow. To prevent theseconsequences, attention should be focused on proper skin exfoliation, puriﬁcation, andregulation of sebum [ 307].With this aim, in vivo treatments with 2% Achillea millefolium extract demonstrated animproved appearance of wrinkles (reduction up to −14%) and pore size (reduction up to−21%), compared to placebo, after 2 months of treatment [ 89,100,305,307].Thus, pores are visibly reﬁned, and dark spots are reduced for an overall lighter,brighter, smoother, and more radiant skin appearance [ 307]. Therefore, beyond nervecell communication, Achillea millefolium extract decrypts, targets, and provides preventivetreatment against skin neuro-aging [ 275].A Strategy to Combat Dark Spots and Skin StressOne of the most common features of aged and photo-exposed skin is pigment spots.
Indeed, recent studies demonstrate that skin’s cellular stress is an intrinsic factor for formingdark spots. In particular, literature and CODIF studies reported a correlation between thedegree of skin innervation, an important release of neuropeptides, and photo-induced skindamage, including pigment spots [ 180,309,310].The p53 protein, known as “the stress protein” because its levels increase duringcellular stress, shows a critical role for cell survival [ 311–313]. It was demonstrated thatp53 directly regulates POMC expression, which encodes α-MSH, involved in melanogen-esis activation [ 313–315]. Hence, when inhibiting the expression of POMC, melanin’soverproduction cannot be triggered, thus preventing the pigment spots [ 309].Melanogenesis occurs in melanocytes, and to export the synthesized melanin, theycommunicate with keratinocytes through their dendrites. Melanocytes are also connected
to nerve ﬁbers, which release neuropeptides. When the latter bind to their receptors atthe dendrites’ surface, these neuropeptides cause melanin synthesis and/or the exportto keratinocytes. In detail, the neuropeptide substance P binds to tachykinin receptor1 (TacR1)—also known as neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R), or substance P receptor (SPR).TacR1 is placed on the surface of the melanocyte dendrites and activates melanin’s exportto the upper layers of the skin. If the length of dendrites and the synthesis of substance Preceptors are limited, a reduction in the quantity of melanin exported to the surface of thepigment spots can be enabled [ 137,309,316].For this purpose, CODIF has developed Neurolight.61 G—an aqueous extract ofPancratium maritimum , able to reduce the area and the pigmentation of dark spots (up to−61%) by inhibiting both the melanin synthesis induced by stressed keratinocytes and themelanin release triggered by substance P [ 279,309].
CODIF reported that when Neurolight.61 G is used at 0.33%, it can inhibit POMCexpression by 65%, reducing both melanin synthesis ( −73%) and melanin transfer (by
CODIF reported that when Neurolight.61 G is used at 0.33%, it can inhibit POMCexpression by 65%, reducing both melanin synthesis ( −73%) and melanin transfer (by−62%). A 50% reduction of receptor TacR1 for substance P synthesis was also observed,thus reducing substance P’s effects [ 309].In vitro tests demonstrated that Neurolight.61G could be considered to be a solution for clarifying dark spots’ pigmentation withoutlightening all skin [ 59], with additional functionality as an anti-aging ingredient [ 279].
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 39 of 80The Youth Proteins: KLOTHO and FOXOFOXO (forkhead box) proteins are a family of transcription factors that play importantroles in regulating the gene expression involved in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation,and longevity [ 84,317–319].The role of FOXO proteins in cellular protection and longevity to ﬁght aging is wellknown. In particular, the “nuclear” form of FOXO activates the transcription of the geneinvolved in cellular detoxiﬁcation and in repairing DNA damage. When phosphorylatedby the AKT (protein kinase B, PKB) factor, FOXO becomes FOXOP and leaves the nucleusfor the cytoplasm, where it loses its properties. The AKT factor activation occurs mainlywith age, favoring the inactive form FOXOP (Figure 3A) [319].Figure 3. Role of FOXO ( A) and KLOTHO ( B).KLOTHO is considered to be the “new youth protein” that slows down aging [320–323],is able to inhibit AKT activation, and maintains FOXO inside the cell nucleus. Its mutation
favors the traditional signs of aging, leading to premature death [ 322–324]. A large numberof signaling pathways involve the KLOTHO protein, aiming to restore optimal cellularfunction (Figure 3B) [322,323].Unfortunately, the decrease in KLOTHO expression starts from 30 years of age, andthe problem worsens with the aging of ﬁbroblasts [ 322]. Thus, a new strategy to combatskin aging should be devoted to increasing KLOTHO synthesis in ﬁbroblasts.Recently, the KLOTHO protein has received great attention in cosmetic studies [ 325].In this regard, as a result, a liposoluble extract derived from Pistacia lentiscus —a plantnative to the Mediterranean region, able to increase the KLOTHO protein synthesis inﬁbroblasts—has been discovered [ 326].Lakesis is the commercial name of a functional ingredient provided by CODIF [ 327].In accordance with in vitro test protocol, human dermal ﬁbroblasts from donors of different
ages were incubated with Lakesis at 0.005% for 24 h, observing a 28% decrease in activeAKT levels. By inhibiting the AKT factor, Lakesis lowers the phosphorylation of FOXO,which activates the transcription of detoxiﬁcation and cellular repair factors in the nucleus.In this case, the predominance of the active form of FOXO was estimated to be 16%.Moreover, the in vitro test demonstrated that Lakesis increases the catalase level—part ofthe enzymatic pool that detoxiﬁes the cell—by 145%.
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 40 of 80By following in vitro protocol, it was observed that 0.2% Lakesis, when appliedtopically for 24 h to reconstituted human skin, promotes cellular detoxiﬁcation processesby inhibiting the thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) (50% decrease), a thioredoxininhibitor. Thioredoxin is a powerful antioxidant system widely studied for its involvementin cellular detoxiﬁcation, and in combating cellular senescence [ 328,329].In vitro tests performed on human dermal ﬁbroblasts from donors of different agesshowed that Lakesis improves cellular activity, increasing the total amount of cellularRNA and, thus, fronting off the aging process. Indeed, the amount of RNA present insidea cell provides important information about the cellular activity rate, which drops withage. Lakesis, when employed at 0.003% for treating human dermal ﬁbroblasts for 24 h,improves type I collagen synthesis by 47%. Indeed, in vitro tests performed on 54-year-
old human dermal ﬁbroblasts treated with Lakesis at 0.005% for ﬁve days showed therejuvenating effect of Lakesis on the extracellular matrix via the reactivation of the synthesisof ﬁbrillin—a major component of elastic ﬁbers—and collagen. In clinical tests, the anti-aging effects of Lakesis on the dermis were also evaluated. With twice-daily applicationof a cream containing 0.2% Lakesis to the whole face for 28 days, by 20 volunteers agedfrom 55 to 65 years old, it was shown that Lakesis increased the density of the supportingﬁbers throughout the dermis, and also ensured their homogeneous distribution. As aresult, from consumer analysis, it exhibits anti-aging efﬁcacy on the face. In detail, afterLakesis treatment for 4 weeks, two-thirds of women involved in the studies observedan improvement of facial contours (+24%), skin ﬁrmness (+23%), and skin thickness(+22%) [ 327].4.4. Biomimetic Peptides
(+22%) [ 327].4.4. Biomimetic PeptidesAs arises from the previous discussion, with the aging of the population and the desireto maintain a young and healthy aspect, the signiﬁcant development of anti-aging productshas been prompted [ 330]. Interestingly, since 2000, the use of peptides has increased rapidlyfor a wide range of skincare applications [ 301,331–333]. This highlights the necessity ofacquiring in-depth knowledge of the different molecules and their associated physiologicalprinciples [ 301].Chemically, peptides are short chains of amino acids linked together by peptidebonds [ 209]. Instead, in the personal care industry, the term ”peptide” refers to moleculesthat can signal physiological changes at the dermal level or, in some cases, effectivelytravel into the dermis and compete with neurotransmitter-binding sites to alter physio-logical activity temporarily [ 301,331–334]. Today, peptides can be developed or modiﬁed
in several ways—to improve solubility, to have better penetration, to increase receptoractivity, etc. [ 301]. More speciﬁcally, it is better to specify that in the ﬁeld of researchand development of skincare cosmetic formulations, bioactive peptides—also known asbiomimetic peptides—are compounds that have an identical amino acid sequence to physi-ological peptides, but are frequently synthesized biotechnologically [ 110,331,332]. They arebecoming increasingly popular for preventing or attenuating the clinical manifestations ofdamaged and dysfunctional skin, especially during the aging process, hyperpigmentation,and wrinkle development [ 35,110]. Many peptides marketed in cosmetic products asanti-aging, antioxidant, skin-lightening, tissue repairing, soothing and neuromodulating,hair growth controlling, moisturizing, and barrier repair peptide ingredients are claimedto slow down the skin’s aging process [ 35,209,332]. Hence, the commercial potential for
these molecules appears to be high [ 301].Biomimetic peptides play several biological roles, especially as signaling/regulating
these molecules appears to be high [ 301].Biomimetic peptides play several biological roles, especially as signaling/regulatingmolecules in a variety of physiological processes (for example, defense, immunity, stress,growth, and homeostasis) [ 110,333], by mimicking the mechanisms of action and the effectsexerted by natural peptides such as growth factors, by interacting with the correspondingreceptors and leading to ﬁnal effects (i.e., slowing of aging) [ 110,331,335–337].Several companies, such as PHARMASPECIAL®, GALENA®, BIOTEC®, LIPOTEC®,and SILAB®, are investing in technologically innovative signal- and neurotransmitter-
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 41 of 80inhibitor peptides particularly indicated as anti-aging ingredients for the formulation ofskincare products [ 110,303].In recent years, advanced techniques to study molecular structures and extract, isolate,characterize, and synthesize novel molecules have been greatly improved [ 35,338–340].Although the process is not complicated or difﬁcult to perform, peptide synthesis, witha deﬁned sequence and high purity (> 90%), can be expensive [ 209,332,341,342]. In thisregard, however, it should be noted that the high efﬁcacy compensates for the cost. In otherwords, for the formulation of cosmetic products, it is possible to employ these peptides inlow amounts [ 303,343].Regarding synthetic procedures, usually, as precursors, the standard synthetic processfor obtaining peptides to be adopted as cosmetic ingredients utilizes amino acids fromplants, fermentation origin, or extracted from certain protein hydrolysates [ 36,331,338,340].
For years, the recombinant production of peptides has also been studied, because it isconsidered less expensive, but the end products are unlikely to be considered to be aspure as those obtained synthetically. In any case, other synthetic approaches for peptidesexist, providing the opportunity to create novel “designed” skincare ingredients [331,338].Indeed, through the synthesis of peptides, the screening of these virtually endless combi-nations of amino acid sequences, the optimization of the chemical structure of potentialpeptide ingredients, their delivery, and their formulation, should open new possibilities forthe future of cosmetic ingredients [ 331,338,339,344].Another aspect for consideration is the peptide concentration that should be supportedby clinical and product-speciﬁc studies [ 332,333]. As a whole, peptides act at extremelylow concentrations—generally at the nanomolar level (10−9mol/L)—because they exhibit
a speciﬁc activity at a speciﬁc target level through a speciﬁc binding process [ 209,331].Indeed, each peptide sequence shows a highly selective binding afﬁnity that translates intoa speciﬁc message. The well-known and simpliﬁed concept of “key” and “lock” interaction(referring, in this case, to the peptide and receptor, respectively) is used to explain thisaction. Unfortunately, peptides exhibit a short lifetime in the organism due to the pres-ence of proteolytic enzymes that break their structure to avoid the overload at the targetsite [ 209,332]. Therefore, the stability of bioactive peptides within a cosmetic formulationis a key feature to ensure active form preservation with the related beneﬁcial effects. Thecost/beneﬁt ratio should depend on the ability to use suitable and optimized amino acid se-quences intended to maximize the bioactivity and targeted beneﬁts [209,332,333,339,345].4.4.1. Topical Peptides and Their Skin Permeability
Topical peptides can be classiﬁed as signals, carriers, enzyme inhibitors, or neurotrans-mitter inhibitors [ 110,301,303,335,346].In detail, signal oligopeptides—also called matrikines—are commonly synthesizedfrom extracellular matrix proteins (EMPs). They boost ﬁbrillogenesis, i.e., they stimulatedermal ﬁbroblasts, with the intent of modulating the EMP network. Furthermore, theyincrease the levels of collagen, elastin, proteoglycan, glycosaminoglycan (GAG), andﬁbronectin deposition, causing ﬁrmer and younger-looking skin, as do the subclass ofcarrier peptides [ 336,344,345,347]. In fact, carrier peptides can be considered a subcategoryof signal oligopeptides [ 336,344]. As an example of this class of topical peptides, it is worthmentioning that Matrixyl (palmitoyl pentapeptide-3) is the ﬁrst peptide to be formulatedin skincare products [ 301,303,331,332,336,344,345,348,349].Enzyme inhibitor peptides act directly and indirectly on enzymes, causing cellu-
lar anti-aging effects in the dermis, generally ascribed to ﬁbrillogenesis and deposi-tion [ 301,303,336,350].
Enzyme inhibitor peptides act directly and indirectly on enzymes, causing cellu-lar anti-aging effects in the dermis, generally ascribed to ﬁbrillogenesis and deposi-tion [ 301,303,336,350].Neurotransmitter peptides proteolyze acetylcholine, releasing proteins at the neuro-muscular junction—such as SNAP-25, syntaxin-1, and synaptobrevin [ 110,303,346,348,351].In detail, the most common peptides that affect the biological function of acetylcholineinclude acetyl hexapeptide-3, pentapeptide-18, pentapeptide-3, acetyl octapeptide-3, andtripeptide-3. [ 303,336,337,344,348,349,352–354]. These peptides can be considered to be
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 42 of 80valid alternatives to botulinum neurotoxin (Botox)—a protein produced by the bacteriumClostridium botulinum (which will be discussed later).The main difﬁculty that should be taken into account when peptides are studied istheir skin permeability [ 224,301,331,335,336,355,356], which generally depends on:• The physicochemical properties of the substance (pKa, molecular size, stability, bind-ing afﬁnity, solubility, and partition coefﬁcient);• The time necessary for the permeation;• The integrity, thickness, and components of the skin, and the cutaneous metabolism;• The site, area, duration of application, and local depot at the site of application.The ideal parameters for topical peptides are listed below:• Molecular weight of less than 500 Da;• Moderate log of partition coefﬁcient octanol/water between 1 and 3;• Melting point less than 200◦C;• Reasonable aqueous solubility (>1 mg mL−1);• Zero or few polar centers.
• Zero or few polar centers.It is worth mentioning that peptides’ transdermal penetration is an important parame-ter to measure the activity and efﬁcacy of topical peptides [ 301,349,356,357]. In this regard,the superﬁcial layer of the epidermis—the stratum corneum (SC)—provides the ﬁrst andmost rate-limiting barrier for skin permeation by substances [ 356,358,359].The SC is a negatively charged tissue, is bound together by tight junctions, and itspH ranges from 5 to 6. It is composed of dead corneocytes surrounded by an intercellularlipid layer, and contains structural proteins, water, and lipids. More speciﬁcally, theextracellular lipid system, which acts as a protective barrier to maintain skin hydration,contains ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. Sebum, organic acids, antioxidants,glycerol, GAGs, and inorganic ions are also present at the surface. Molecules’ diffusivitythrough the stratum corneum is related not only to the size of the molecule, but also to
the number of hydrogen bonds present in the molecule itself. In detail, the diffusivityis maximal for small, non-hydrogen-bonding molecules, and reaches a minimum whenapproximately four hydrogen bonds are present. It is necessary for a peptide to cross thecutaneous barrier to reach the viable epidermis (keratinocytes), the basal layer (melanocytes,nerve cell endings), the dermis (ﬁbroblasts), and even the hypodermis (adipocytes) [ 209,336,360–362]. However, since peptides and proteins contain many amide bonds (as hydrogenbond donor and acceptor groups), and usually show large molecular size, a low diffusivityin the skin is exhibited [ 335,362].Although the topical use of peptides can be considered promising in terms of efﬁcacy,the delivery across the skin could be difﬁcult due to the ionic nature of these materials.Indeed, these peptides are charged at physiological pH, and as a result, they are intrin-
sically hydrophilic. Thus, the lipophilic stratum corneum represents a barrier to theirpenetration [ 332,335,359]. Moreover, proteolytic enzymes and the skin’s bacterial ﬂorasupport this barrier in degrading topical peptides [ 336].Interestingly, regarding the SC, the skin permeability varies on different parts of thebody. However, three main permeation methods can be taken into account for topicaldrugs: intercellular, transcellular, and transappendageal [ 360,363,364].Hydrophobic substances are more permeable in parts of the skin with higher lipidcontent, such as the face. In contrast, hydrophilic substances permeate more readily in thepalms and the soles of the feet, since they contain relatively lower lipid quantities [ 336].Lastly, permeation is affected by biological factors, including age, the integrity of theskin, its thickness, and its components, as well as the cutaneous metabolism [ 336] and the
skin type (particularly in the case of dry or aged skin) [ 262,332,365]. Overall, aged skincontains fewer lipids. Therefore, topical peptides may be more effective in aged people
skin type (particularly in the case of dry or aged skin) [ 262,332,365]. Overall, aged skincontains fewer lipids. Therefore, topical peptides may be more effective in aged peoplethan in younger populations [ 262,336].With the advent of more sophisticated software, there is considerably further pre-dictability in estimating a compound’s behavior with respect to skin penetration [ 332].
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 43 of 80For example, Ham et al. demonstrated that, by simple amino acid substitution, the skinpenetration of peptides might be signiﬁcantly increased [ 366].4.4.2. Delivery Systems for PeptidesLiposome formulations and colloidal carrier systems are preferred for the dermaldelivery of peptides through the epidermal barrier by targeting hair follicles or structurallyaltering the intercellular lipid network [ 335,336,361,367,368]. An important advantage ofthe use of liposomal carriers is the ability to protect encapsulated proteins, and deliverto different cell types while avoiding, according to the case, skin toxicity—especially ifliposomes are made of epidermal lipids [ 336,364,369,370].The delivery efﬁcacy is related to the site and time of the topical protein’s application,and to the possibility of creating a local depot at the application site [ 336,364,371,372].The use of chemical penetration enhancers might also be valu able [ 332,335,342,349,373].
Another approach to improve delivery is the use of fatty acid derivatives that increase thepeptides’ lipophilic properties (for example, the palmito yl derivative) [333,335,336,349,374].Interestingly, recent studies have discovered good, alternative ways to increase tran-scutaneous delivery—by using amphiphilic cell penetration peptides (CPP) [ 374–376],attaching a polyarginine chain to a peptide [ 377–380], or designing hyaluronic acid (HA)conjugates [ 379,381]—thus improving peptides’ bioactivity and bioavailability [ 331]. Inrecent years, other approaches for the transdermal delivery of peptides are gaining popu-larity, including iontophoresis—which uses small electric currents to enable the passage ofcharged peptides through the skin—and microdermabrasion, a method that removes someof the layers of the SC in order to improve the absorption of topical peptides, suitable forﬁne lines and wrinkles [ 336,355,370,382–385].
ﬁne lines and wrinkles [ 336,355,370,382–385].Another important aspect that should be taken into consideration, especially froma regulatory and toxicological point of view, is the safety of peptides’ use in cosmeticproducts. In particular, they should be non-immunogenic and non-irritant in order toavoid any side effects [ 209,331,332,338]. Therefore, studies were performed both in vitroand in vivo on the safety of the bioactive peptides.For example, according to the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), up to 2012,palmitoyl-like peptides have been the most extensively tested molecules, together with thebioactive acetyl hexapeptide-3, whose safety has been evaluated via skin irritation test andpatch test [ 110,353,354,386,387].In conclusion, new horizons in this ﬁeld are expected, and some of them suggest theuse of functional foods, such as nutritional supplements, as a comprehensive approach tohealth maintenance [ 333,338,388–390].
health maintenance [ 333,338,388–390].Moreover, since the demand on the personal care market is growing, the manufactur-ers’ competition to guarantee claims about the improvement of the appearance of skin isalso increasing [ 301,303,391]. Research to develop novel ingredients, smart delivery sys-tems, and convenient technologies is a fascinating challenge facing cosmetic manufacturers.It is worth mentioning that despite these formulation challenges, peptides remain the mostpopular, widely used functional ingredients—especially for anti-aging skincare products.4.4.3. Neurotransmitter-Affecting PeptidesWrinkles are partially due to excessive stressor stimuli on the facial muscles; unsur-prisingly, it is usual to refer to them as “ expression lines ” [392–394].From a physiological point of view, the release of a speciﬁc neurotransmitter—acetylch-oline—allows muscles to contract. This mechanism starts at the presynaptic terminal, where
a cascade of protein–protein interactions ends with the fusion of vesicles loaded with acetyl-choline to the neuron membrane. In detail, a variation in membrane potential enhances the
a cascade of protein–protein interactions ends with the fusion of vesicles loaded with acetyl-choline to the neuron membrane. In detail, a variation in membrane potential enhances theentry of Ca2+ions into the neuron. Then, once these ions enter the presynaptic terminal,the release of acetylcholine from the vesicles occurs [ 301,393]. SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein 25)—a membrane receptor protein associated with vesicles, involving theSNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor activating protein receptor) complex—
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 44 of 80modulates this process, regulating the binding and fusion of the vesicles [ 301,395,396]. Indetail, to form the SNARE complex, Munc-18 (mammalian uncoordinate-18) proteins mustbind to syntaxin, followed by SNAP-25 and VAMP (vesicle-associated membrane protein,necessary for the synaptic vesicle’s docking and fusion to the presynaptic membrane forthe acetylcholine release) [ 397,398].Munc-18 proteins are considered important both as components of the synaptic vesi-cle fusion protein complex, and for exocytosis. This protein directly promotes syntaxinstability by controlling the assembly of core complexes for SNARE-dependent fusion, orby interacting with the SNARE core. In particular, Munc-18a binds to the N-terminal ofsyntaxin, favoring a conformational change that induces the activation of syntaxin, whichin turn connects to the ternary SNARE complex [ 399].It has also been reported that proteins belonging to the Munc-18 class bind to the
C-terminal of synaptobrevin, suggesting that this type of protein is involved in membranefusion.The VAMP protein is linked to a vesicle containing acetylcholine that, after the SNAREcomplex’s formation, fuses with the neuron membrane, inducing the release of acetyl-choline into the synaptic space [ 397,399]. Thus, acetylcholine binds to its receptors onmuscle cells, leading to muscle contraction through the release of Ca2+ions [ 301,397,400].It is worth mentioning that some synthetic peptides, used for anti-aging cosmetic products,exhibit structural analogies with the sequence present within the SNAP-25 (amino acids12–17) N-terminal region, and compete with SNAP-25 for the binding sites in the SNAREcomplex, modulating its formation [ 110,301,303,330]. This structural feature destabilizesthe SNARE complex, causing the inhibition of the acetylcholine release and the attenuationof muscle contraction [ 330].
of muscle contraction [ 330].These kinds of peptides that speciﬁcally inhibit neurosecretion, relax muscles, andsoften wrinkles are known as neurotransmitter-inhibitor peptides [ 110,301,338,348,401,402];pentapeptide-3, acetyl tripeptide-30 citrulline, and pentapeptide-18 can be considered someexamples (see Table 2).• Pentapeptide-3 (Vialox) is a synthetic peptide derived from snake venom, which actsat the postsynaptic membrane level by following a tubocurarine-like mechanism ofaction [ 301,335,344,348]. It is a competitive antagonist of the nicotinic acetylcholinemembrane receptor [ 21,403]. Indeed, it prevents the release of sodium ions (Na+)required for the depolarization and contraction of muscle ﬁbers, leading to musclerelaxation [ 21,335,336]. Less frequent contractions of muscles result in thinner lines.Softened wrinkles and reduced skin roughness were observed during in vivo andin vitro studies performed for testing this product; the results showed that, after
28 days of twice-daily use, wrinkle depth was reduced by about 49% [ 21,335];• Vanistryl®, commercialized by Galena and Lipotec [ 404], is a complex of the bioac-tive peptides acetyl tripeptide-30 citrulline and pentapeptide-18 [ 110,404]. If acetyltripeptide-30 citrulline is a signal peptide [ 301,335,336], conversely, pentapeptide-18is a neurotransmitter inhibitor peptide [ 335,336,348,405]. These peptides are used informulations for wrinkle smoothing, and act synergistically, when applied to the skin,to modulate muscular tension and inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [ 110,406].Vanistryl®protects the connective tissue from degradation, and rebuilds ECM anddermal components, conferring to skin the integrity and elasticity needed. Further-more, it exhibits wound-healing and smoothness effects, and reduces skin tension.In vivo skin surface studies (tightness and drying), color studies, and skin elasticity
analysis were performed to demonstrate a visible attenuation of stretch marks whenVanistryl®is used [ 110,404,406].

Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 52 of 804.4.4. Botulinum Neurotoxin: The First Neurotransmitter Inhibi tor Anti-Wrinkle IngredientBotulinum toxin is a neurotoxic protein produced by the Clostridium botulinum bac-terium [ 407–410]. Its commercial name is Botox, and it is the most potent known toxin, andone of the most powerful muscle blockers [ 330,408,411–415].Structurally, the protein is a disulﬁde-linked heterodimer constituted by two polypep-tidic chains: one at a higher molecular weight (”heavy”, 100 kDa), and the other lighter(“light”, 50 kDa) [ 408,416,417].The toxin is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis after binding to the pe-ripheral neuronal presynaptic membrane, mediated by the heavy polypeptidic chain.After the translocation into the cytoplasm from the endocytic vesicles, the botulinum’slighter chain acts as a protease. It proteolytically cleaves one of the proteins (SNAP-25,
synaptobrevin, or syntaxin) of the neuromuscular junction, depending on the neurotoxin’sserological subtype. The cleavage of these proteins is an important factor needed forthe acetylcholine vesicles’ fusion with the inner side of the nerve terminal membrane.Thus, the result is the inhibition of the release of neurotransmitters at neuromuscularjunctions [ 330,408,409,412,413,416,418,419]. According to several studies, one botulinumtoxin can inhibit a single neuron. This explains the extraordinary toxicity of this substance.The inhibition of acetylcholine determines the block of the nerve impulse. There-fore, the botulinum toxin acts by temporarily paralyzing the muscles into which it is in-jected [418,419]. Due to its high toxicity, its use for aesthetic reasons is authorized only in themedical ﬁeld (i.e., maxillofacial surgery, dermatology, and ophthalmology) [410,415,420,421].If these injections take place at the facial mimic muscles (responsible for facial expression
lines), they can reduce or eliminate this kind of wrinkles, conferring a more youthfulappearance to the facial skin [ 421,422].However, the risk is high, so many consumers chose to avoid Botox, and started tolook for topical, non-injected solutions that mimic its activity [ 334,345,423].4.4.5. Topical Peptidomimetic Ingredients as Alternatives to BotoxMuscular contractions also perturb the lipid matrix; when muscle contraction isblocked, the lipid matrix maintains its proﬁle, and the skin deformation does not occur,stopping the appearance of wrinkles [ 301,334].Several studies are focused on discovering novel functional ingredients as non-invasive alternatives to Botox, focusing the interest especially on peptides that can mois-turize, ﬁrm, reduce roughness, and smooth wrinkles by interfering with neurosecretionaccording to different mechanisms [ 301,330,332,337,344]. Generally, they work to inhibit
the release of neurotransmitters involved in muscle contraction indirectly by closing Ca2+channels [ 110,301,344,345,424], or by stimulating the release of endogenous messengers(i.e., enkephalins) that induce muscle relaxation [ 335,405]. Several biomimetic peptideswere studied for the interesting properties they display at the level of the dermal struc-ture, where they stimulate ﬁbroblasts to produce collagen, conferring anti-wrinkle andmoisturizing beneﬁts on the facial skin [ 110,209,330,337].Traditionally, peptides have been produced by partial hydrolysis of proteins of plantor animal origin, in order to obtain mixtures of peptides [ 36,337,338,343,397].The cosmetics industry searched for and developed a variety of safer, Botox-likefunctional ingredients, providing similar and relatively rapid results [ 301,332,334,344,348,376]. Peptides and plant extracts available on the market as alternatives to Botox

will be discussed, presenting their mechanisms of action, scientiﬁc efﬁcacy, and in vivoexperimental results.An overview of the most used Botox-like functional ingredients is carefully reportedin Table 2, with the related useful features for their use.• Acetyl hexapeptide-3 and -8—synthetic peptides that, by mimicking the portion ofSNAP-25, compete with it for the SNARE complex—were the ﬁrst Botox-like ingredi-ents brought to market by LIPOTEC, with the trade name Argireline®[425,426]. Whenthis analog peptide replaces SNAP-25, the SNARE complex is destabilized, and the
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 53 of 80release of acetylcholine is inhibited, resulting in muscle contraction being signiﬁcantlyreduced [ 334,337,353,354]. It was scientiﬁcally demonstrated that Argireline®is a safe,effective anti-wrinkle ingredient [ 337,352,427], particularly suitable for eye care prod-uct formulation [ 345,354]. The results derived from clinical tests showed a wrinkledepth reduction of up to 16.9% within 15 days, and up to 27% within 30 days [ 395,396].For performing these tests, a cream containing 10% Argireline®was applied twicedaily around the eyes by women aged 44. Moreover, when a cream containing 2%Argireline®was applied in the periorbital area by women aged 35–45, a reduction inwrinkle volume (up to 20.6%) and length (up to 15.9%) was observed within 7 days.An improvement of the skin tone and the presence of fewer wrinkles are the ﬁnalvisible beneﬁts [ 303,334,335,402];• Inyline®peptide (Acetyl Hexapeptide-30) by LIPOTEC uses a novel cosmetic approach
to reduce muscle contraction and expression wrinkles. It targets the agrin/MuSK post-synaptic pathway, behaving as a competitive antagonist of MuSK (muscle-speciﬁckinase) at the agrin-binding site [ 428], inactivating the formation of the agrin/MuSKcomplex and preventing acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering—a requirementfor triggering muscle contraction [ 330,429–431]. Agrin is a proteoglycan involved inthe organization of the basement membrane architecture [ 432,433]. A speciﬁc form ofagrin, released by motor neurons, was mainly studied for developing skeletal muscleﬁbers; it represents a signal for maintaining the acetylcholine receptors’ aggregation,ensuring the neuromuscular junction (NMJ)’s assembly [ 434,435]. In detail, the agrin,produced by the growing ends of motor neuron axons, binds to MuSK—a tyrosinekinase receptor required for the formation of the neuromuscular junction [ 429,430,
435,436].In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to assess the ability ofInyline®to attenuate expression lines. During in vivo tests, 20 female volunteers aged41–50 applied a cream containing 5% Inyline®peptide solution to the crow’s feet areatwice daily for 28 days. The obtained results showed that the treatment decreasedwrinkle depth by 14.9% [ 437];• BONT-L Peptide Solution (palmitoyl hexapeptide-19) is a synthetic Botox-like pep-tide [ 438] by INFINITEC [ 334], able to inactivate SNAP-25 by inhibiting the formationof the SNARE protein complex [ 439,440]. As a result, the release of acetylcholine intothe synaptic cleft is prevented [ 440]. Moreover, an in vivo study on 15 volunteerswho used a 5% cream applied twice daily showed a reduction in periorbital areamicro-reliefs of 38% in 28 days [ 334];• Acetyl octapeptide-3, marketed as Snap 8 by LIPOTEC [ 441], is an elongated sequence
of Argireline peptide [ 303,442]. This analogy allows Snap 8 to mimic SNAP-25 in orderto compete effectively in the SNARE complex, obtaining a signiﬁcant inhibitory effect.It is promoted as the “next-generation” Botox alternative. When used in a 10% creamapplied twice a day for 28 days, a reduction in wrinkle depth around the periorbitalarea of up to 63% was observed [ 334,336,441–443].Another way to reduce muscular contractions is to prevent or reduce the inﬂux ofCa2+ ions into the cell—a necessary condition for the fusion of the vesicle containingACh with the cell membrane, and its release into the synaptic space [ 334]. As previouslydiscussed, if the Botox equivalents act as competitors with SNAP-25, conversely, othernovel ingredients can inhibit the formation of the SNARE protein complex and the vesiclemigration by blocking calcium entry [ 334].For example, this behavior can be observed for palmitoyl hexapeptide-52 and Pentape-ptide-18.
ptide-18.• X50 Myocept by INFINITEC [ 444]—a blend of palmitoyl hexapeptide-52, lactic acid,glycolic acid, and palmitoyl heptapeptide-18—when used at just 0.001%, reduces
ptide-18.• X50 Myocept by INFINITEC [ 444]—a blend of palmitoyl hexapeptide-52, lactic acid,glycolic acid, and palmitoyl heptapeptide-18—when used at just 0.001%, reducesexpression lines around the periorbital area by 20–27% in 28 days [ 334];• Pentapeptide-18 (Leuphasyl) by LIPOTEC mimics the physiological mechanism ofenkephalins and, by blocking calcium channels in the neuron, inhibits catecholamineand acetylcholine release [ 21,301,405,445]. As a consequence, the inhibitory G-protein-
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 54 of 80coupled receptor activation occurs with a decrease in the neuronal cell’s excitability,preventing the neurotransmitter release [ 336]. Its Botox-like effects and its safe ef-ﬁcacy were demonstrated, observing the reduction in the depth of ﬁne lines andwrinkles. Moreover, other interesting properties include its hydration ability andimprovement of skin ﬁrmness and tone [ 301,445,446]. Recently, another aspect wasalso explored, widening pentapeptide-18 (Leuphasyl)’s cosmetic qualities. Park et al.(2020) modiﬁed the commercial anti-aging pentapeptide-18 by substituting the N-terminal L-tyrosine with D-tyrosine, or adding L/D-tyrosine at the C-terminus. Therole in the melanogenesis process was clearly demonstrated, particularly in the caseof Leuphasyl peptide analogs containing C-terminal D-tyrosine, adding whiteningproperties to a remarkable anti-aging cosmeceutical [ 446]. It was also well proven that
pentapeptide-18, when in the presence of acetyl hexapeptide-3, shows a synergisticeffect [ 110,301,334]. Many studies showed that a cream containing 5% Leuphasyl with5% Argireline caused a reduction of wrinkles in the periorbital area from 25% to 47%within 28 days [ 334,402];• Acetyl dipeptide-1 cetyl ester (Calmosensine™), by SEDERMA—a synthetic replica ofthe naturally occurring peptide in the body—provides an in vitro Botox-like activityfor the reversible inhibition of muscle contractions [ 334,447]. More speciﬁcally, it stim-ulates the release of pro-endorphins by keratinocytes, leading to the stimulation ofrelaxation messengers in the skin [ 334]. As a whole, Calmosensine™prevents the onsetof wrinkles and expression lines by relieving muscular tensions [ 334,447]. Further-more, Calmosensine™plays an important role in modulating the cutaneous perceptionof unpleasant sensations—such as heat—improving skin comfort, as conﬁrmed by
in vivo studies [ 303,448]. Another important cosmetic property of the active acetyldipeptide-1 cetyl ester is its ability to signiﬁcantly upregulate epidermal barrier genes,as shown by the results in the work of Khmaladze et al. (2020). [ 449] Moreover, acetyldipeptide 1 cetyl ester can signiﬁcantly reactivate elastogenesis by upregulating someof the most important dermal genes associated with skin wrinkling, such as alpha-1type I collagen, decorin, lysyl oxidase-like 1, and ﬁbrillin-1. Additionally, it showedinteresting anti-glycation activity and promoted proteasomal activity. Thus, acetyldipeptide 1 cetyl ester is a promising active compound for skincare formulations,especially if an improved barrier function is essential [ 449].4.4.6. Plant Extract Alternatives to BotoxAlongside Botox-like functional peptide ingredients of both natural and syntheticorigins, some extracts derived from plants as further alternatives to muscle relaxants can
be used to formulate anti-aging cosmetic products.Interestingly, CODIF re-discovered the ancestral use of Lavandula stoechas oil—alsoknown as butterﬂy lavender oil—to provide a relaxing effect on expression lines. Theydeveloped and patented Stoechiol [ 273]—a liposoluble lavender extract obtained via asupercritical CO 2extraction process—as a Botox-like anti-aging ingredient speciﬁcallydesigned for mature skin types [ 273].The wrinkle-relaxing strategy proposed using Stoechiol consists of reversible inhibi-tion of muscle contractions for an instantaneous smoothing effect on the cutaneous reliefs,and the restructuring of the epidermis to reduce wrinkles’ depth. In fact, over time, therepeated contractions break down the structure of the epidermis and stratum corneum,worsening the already formed furrows. As a result, a loss of epidermal cohesion acceleratesthe formation of wrinkles and the natural desquamation processes. Cell co-cultures of
motor neurons on a monolayer of muscle cells were used to perform in vitro tests to assessthe relaxing effect of Stoechiol on their contraction frequency.
motor neurons on a monolayer of muscle cells were used to perform in vitro tests to assessthe relaxing effect of Stoechiol on their contraction frequency.It was also shown that Stoechiol stimulates keratinocyte division in the basal layerand promotes the synthesis of the lipid cement by the keratinocytes present in the stratumgranulosum.
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 55 of 80Stoechiol helps the reorganization and the cohesion of the corneocytes by increasingthe expression of the adhesion proteins of the stratum corneum.Clinical tests on 20 volunteers aged between 46 and 59 years proved the anti-wrinkleand smoothing efﬁcacy after 7 days of applying 0.25% or 1% Stoechiol, twice daily to, thecrow’s feet area [ 273].BASF Care Creations offers Myoxinol ™[450]—an oligopeptide complex obtainedfrom the native proteins extracted from the seeds of Hibiscus esculentus [451]. It is used tosigniﬁcantly inhibit facial muscle contraction, preventing the formation of crow’s feet andnasolabial lines [ 452,453].Myoxinol’s potential as an anti-wrinkle functional ingredient was ﬁrstly assessedby an in vitro test on a co-cultured muscle cell and neuron system. Its ability to inhibitmuscle cells’ contraction was evaluated by measuring the frequency of contractions over
24 h. These in vitro tests also demonstrated an antioxidant effect, as an additional advan-tage [ 454–456].A clinical test performed involving the application of a cream containing 1% Myoxinolto the crow’s feet area for three weeks suggested that wrinkles became less noticeable—byapproximately 26%. The skin appeared lifted and revitalized as ﬁnal beneﬁts, thanks to amild exfoliation, an improvement of epidermal thickness, and cohesion [ 457].Gatuline Expression by GATTEFOSS Éis an alternative to Botox based on a plantextract derived from Acmella oleracea , which was standardized to contain the key activeconstituent, spilanthol [ 334,458–460].Due to its Botox-like action, spilanthol inhibits subcutaneous muscle contractions,particularly at the facial level [ 458,461–465].In vivo studies revealed that a cream containing 2% of this extract, when applied twicedaily to the crow’s feet area, showed results in 75% of volunteers even during the ﬁrst day
of application. Interestingly, after 20 days of application, a reduction in skin roughness ofup to 16% was evident to the participants [ 334].Santana et al. (2011) evaluated the properties of Laricifomes ofﬁcinalis , rice protein,and glutamic acid as anti-aging ingredients by using neuromuscular preparations. Bysimulating a Botox-like effect, these components induced a neuromuscular blockade, bothindividually and in the mixture. A dose–response curve with the mixture was performedto assess these effects [ 466].Laricifomes ofﬁcinalis is a wood-rotting fungus present on coniferous tree trunks in thenorthern region of China and in the Paciﬁc Northwest of the United States, Canada, andEurope. Vital Especialidades market it as a functional ingredient for anti-aging cosmeticproducts [ 466,467].Generally, rice protein from Oryza sativa L. seeds is considered to be an enzymeinhibitor due to its mechanism of action. It can be used alone as an anti-aging active
ingredient. It inhibits matrix metalloprotease activity, and causes hyaluronan synthase 2gene expression in keratinocytes [ 466,468].4.4.7. In Silico Designed Botox-Like PeptidesBiomimetic peptides can also be designed in silico; thus, their structures are optimizedto ﬁnd the lowest energy interactions between amino acids and their biological target,necessary for highly speciﬁc and efﬁcacious interfacing [ 339,397,398,469].Through a randomized screening process, the researchers can test many structurallysimilar compounds but differ from their constituents. In this way, it is possible to simul-taneously evaluate large “libraries” of peptides to identify the most active compoundquickly [ 339]. As a whole, these peptides are usually synthesized in the solid phase tocreate novel cosmetic ingredients.Acetyl-hexapeptide-1 is one example [ 397]; it was synthesized by using the followingsteps: After the identiﬁcation of the best amino acid sequence to target pre-synaptic
muscle contraction pathways, the acetyl-hexapeptide-1 was identiﬁed as being able to
steps: After the identiﬁcation of the best amino acid sequence to target pre-synapticmuscle contraction pathways, the acetyl-hexapeptide-1 was identiﬁed as being able tocompete with Munc-18 for binding to syntaxin, thus exhibiting a Botox-like activity [ 397].
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 56 of 80Interestingly, the results obtained from in vitro efﬁcacy tests showed a reduction of Munc-18/syntaxin binding of up to 37%, consequently reducing acetylcholine release by up to35%. Furthermore, computational analysis shows the possibility that acetyl-hexapeptide-1could have a potential post-synaptic activity, conﬁrmed by in vitro tests. Thus, this peptidebinds to the post-synaptic receptors, disrupting the acetylcholine receptor cluster andimpeding the Ca2+release needed for muscle contraction [ 397].Acetyl-hexapeptide-1 can be considered to be the ﬁrst available ingredient that affectsboth the pre-and post-synaptic muscle contraction processes, showing a double-actionapproach corroborated by in vivo studies. Thus, acetyl-hexapeptide-1 can reduce theexpression of wrinkles and lift the labial commissures [ 397].From a recent study, it has been demonstrated that Botox-like peptides, usually used
as SNARE modulators, could inhibit synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) [ 398].Syt1 is a transmembrane Ca2+sensor protein located on synaptic vesicles that plays akey role in neurotransmitter release [ 399]. Indeed, the Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitterrelease in neurons is strongly inhibited by botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), which behaveas metalloprotease enzymes able to speciﬁcally break down the synaptic proteins requiredfor the neuronal-controlled exocytosis—the plasma membrane protein syntaxin (Syn), thesynaptic protein SNAP-25, and the vesicular protein VAMP . As a consequence, the SNAREcomplex made of these proteins is destabilized, delaying vesicle fusion with the plasmamembrane and inhibiting the Ca2+-triggered exocytosis [ 398,399].Thus, an interesting approach to reduce wrinkles consists of reducing neuron activityby inhibiting Syt1.For this purpose, Wongrattanakamon et al. (2018) studied the ability of Botox-like
peptides as Syt1 inhibitors by adopting molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD)simulation investigations in their work [ 398]. The authors identiﬁed the possible bindingcleft and mechanism of action, and these ﬁndings could represent a starting point fordeveloping novel Botox-like anti-wrinkle molecules that target and modulate Syt1 function.During this work, the Botox-like peptides Argireline, SNAP-8, and Leuphasyl were selectedfor docking and studied by analyzing the predicted binding energy, the ligand-bindingconformation, and the interacting amino acid residue and atom; a good docking afﬁnityto Syt1 was observed. In particular, the authors reported that these Botox-like peptidesoccupied the binding site area inside Syt1—speciﬁcally referring to the C2 domains, C2Aand C2B, which also bind to Ca2+and synaptic SNARE complexes. The MD simulationsshowed that these peptides induce Syt1 rigidity by binding to C2A–C2B, which are involved
during the conformational change of Syt1from a closed to an open form [ 398].However, the next step could focus on designing more selective Botox-like moleculesas inhibitors of Syt1, avoiding the occurrence of conformational changes in order to offersafer anti-wrinkle ingredients.These results should open novel horizons for modulating Syt1 to explore and appro-priately characterize the Botox-like molecules’ binding sites and their possible mechanismof action [ 398].In conclusion, the Botox-like ingredients could provide consumers with the beneﬁtsthat they desire from using skincare products, without the risks or discomfort associatedwith the injectable treatments [ 344,410].5. Anti-Aging Neurocosmetic Formulations on the MarketIn recent times, many cosmetic companies have tried to bring their innovative neuro-cosmetic product lines to market, both as regards formulation technologies and ingredients,intending to offer beneﬁts to consumers in short timeframes.
In general, consumers’ demands focus on innovative cosmetic products that are safe,
intending to offer beneﬁts to consumers in short timeframes.In general, consumers’ demands focus on innovative cosmetic products that are safe,effective, and of high quality. Hence, industries have tried to meet those demands [ 470,471].Moreover, each cosmetic product on the market must conform to the current legislationof the country or countries where the cosmetic is marketed, in order to guarantee quality,efﬁcacy, and safety [ 472,473].
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 57 of 80It is necessary to demonstrate that:• All ingredients are safe after testing their toxicity in vitro , ex vivo, and in vivo [29,473];• All ingredients are compatible with one another and with their packaging as theﬁnished formulation. Consequently, to assess this aspect, it is necessary to carry outstability studies on the end product in the chosen ﬁnal pack [ 474,475];• The active ingredients do not claim any therapeutic effect on the skin [ 29];• The packaging is aesthetically attractive and safe;• All information about the products labeled on the packaging is clear for consumers [ 476];• End products are also pleasant and have an adequate cost–beneﬁt ratio.A signiﬁcant challenge for the marketing of the manufacturing companies is howcosmetic products can be portrayed, as well as ﬁnding the right way to communicate toconsumers the innovations related to a novel functional ingredient present in the cosmetic
product’s formulation, its effectiveness, the product’s use, or innovative packaging [ 476].Regarding innovative active ingredients, ARKANA [ 477]—a modern brand fromPoland—represents an example, proposing a series of interesting active polypeptide ingre-dients, some of which are described in the following.• Suitable for mature skin types, Bo2Look Therapy MD estetic serum, elixir, and wrinklerelaxer are formulated with the patented neuropeptide XEP™-018 [ 478,479]. The latteris a non-invasive anti-aging ingredient alternative to Botox, indicated for smooth-ing mimic wrinkles by relaxing facial muscles [ 480]. The main component of thisformulation is the Mu-conotoxin CnIIIC, a synthetic biomimetic peptide inspiredby that of venomous marine cone snail ( Conus consors ) [442,480–483]. This peptideblocks both voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav 1.4) and nicotinic acetylcholinereceptors (nAChR), performing its action as a neuromuscular transmission modula-
tor [ 442,480,483–486]. It instantly relaxes expression wrinkles when used for formu-lating a cosmetic product, giving a smooth skin appearance. In fact, in vivo studiesconducted on 33 volunteers using a product containing 3% XEP-018 showed a visiblereduction in wrinkle depth and rugosity 2 h after a single application [ 480,483,487];• NEURO GABA&NANA THERAPY MD serum, cream, peel, and neuro gaba liftmask consist of a combined lifting and peeling instant treatment that contains GABA(gamma-aminobutyric acid) and NANA (N-acetyl-5-neuraminic acid) neurotrans-mitters, and lactic acid [ 488]. The smoothing of furrows and improvement of skintension (“freezing effect”), immediate ﬁlling of wrinkles (“plumping effect”), and skinmoisturization (“hydro effect”) are the ensured visible effects. When low- and high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid is added, it deeply and long-lastingly moisturizesthe skin, ﬁlls wrinkles, and makes the skin ﬁrm and ﬂexible [ 489].
The action performed by the combination of the ingredients indicates that GABArelaxes muscles, soothes the skin, repairs cellular damage, promotes hyaluronic acid andcollagen synthesis, and reduces wrinkles [ 490,491], while NANA promotes collagen andelastin regeneration by preventing their degradation, as well as reducing wrinkles [ 492].Lactic acid, beyond the ability to enhance the other functional ingredients’ penetration,makes the skin ﬂexible, moisturizes it, and stimulates the production of ceramides thatseal the lipid barrier [ 13,493,494]. This intense lifting treatment is particularly indicated formature skin types [ 489].• Carbo V Re-Constructor Serum, Carbo V Elixir, and Carbo V Re-Constructor—non-invasive “home care” treatments with effects similar to carboxytherapy—combineXIMILENE®(ethyl ximenynate), arginine, and PROGELINE™—a remodeling peptide—as an alternative to thread lifts [ 495–498].
as an alternative to thread lifts [ 495–498].Ximenynic acid and arginine improve microcirculation, promote skin oxygenation,
as an alternative to thread lifts [ 495–498].Ximenynic acid and arginine improve microcirculation, promote skin oxygenation,stimulate collagen production, and increase skin nourishment to make skin ﬁrm [ 340,499–503]. PROGELINE™boosts these effects by restoring and improving the facial oval shapein the “V” zone, reinforcing collagen and elastin ﬁbers, ﬁrming and lifting the skin, andeliminating double chin, ﬂabby skin, and jowls [ 297,302,303].
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 58 of 80• Biomimetic Therapy PRO line is an intense home care treatment for mature skin typesthat prevents and reduces the signs of aging. This product, thanks to the presence ofProgeline™, Adipoﬁll’in™, and hyaluronic acid, is proposed for the loss of deﬁned facecontour, skin laxity, and drooping eyelids. It improves skin elasticity and ﬂexibility,ﬁrms, and lifts wrinkles [ 504].LUCAS MEYER COSMETICS produces another interesting formulation containingmodern active ingredients, with the trade name Adipoﬁll’in™[505–507].Adipoﬁll’in™is a patented neurocosmetic functional ingredient containing an L-Ornithine amino acid biotechnologically obtained from vegetable starch and encapsulatedin an Ionosome™delivery system. It mimics the lipohormesis phenomenon (an adaptiveresponse of the adipose tissue to micro-stress exposure) by activating the gene expressionof the transcription factor HIF-1 α(hypoxia-inducible factor 1- α), affecting the activation
of adipogenesis (transformation of pre-adipocytes into adipocytes), the activation of lipo-genesis (triglyceride synthesis), and the inhibition of lipolysis (the breakdown of lipidsinto free fatty acids) [ 508–513]. In particular, since Adipoﬁll’in™lowers the free fatty acidrelease from adipocytes, it induces triglyceride storage, provoking adipocyte swelling, i.e.,increase in size. Therefore, by inducing the reﬁlling of cell fat with the increases in fattytissue volume, the result mimics the cosmetic surgery effect of lipoﬁlling. Clinical testsdemonstrated that Adipoﬁll’in™, with its non-invasive and bio-controlled mechanism,combats age-related lipoatrophy, improving the signs of aging—such as nasogenian folddepth, skin smoothness, and roughness, causing a plumper and more youthful look [ 508].Generally, as reported by Rattan (2013), if referring to the aging process, hormesiscan be deﬁned as the beneﬁcial effects derived from the cellular response after stimuli by
physical, chemical, and biological stressors—i.e., irradiation, pro-oxidants, exercise, etc.—resulting in the improvement of cells, tissues, organs, and organisms’ physiology [ 514].Moreover, several studies reported in the literature show that many foods’ componentsare responsible for positive effects on human health [ 514,515].For this reason, these ingredients started to be used for the formulation of differentanti-aging skincare cosmetic products [ 514,515].As for the formulation of cosmetics more suitable for delivering the active ingredientto the target, it is necessary to consider various parameters, such as the skin type or thedesired aesthetic effect.The anti-age treatments can be formulated to meet different needs, depending on thetype of effect (protective/preventive and restorative/soothing, in case of the ﬁrst and mostevident accentuated aging signs, respectively), and be made suitable for different skin
types. Indeed, melting emulsions, for example, with their rich and comfortable after-feel,are preferred for dry/very dry skin, while light-textured products with an evanescentskin-feel are preferred for combination/oily skin.Therefore, the most common cosmetic forms—the O/W (oil in water) or W/O (waterin oil) emulsions—are applied differently.Today, anti-aging creams can also be formulated with sunscreen ingredients, differen-tiating daily and night treatments.Usually, a cream treatment is often proposed in combination with the concentratedserum, which must be applied ﬁrst, with the aim of enhancing the derived beneﬁts [ 471].6. Neurocosmetics: What about Regulation?In our society, as it emerges from several surveys and web sources, loyalty andtransparency—the best premises for safety and efﬁcacy—are fundamental for each prod-uct [ 516–519].In the Cosmetic Regulation (EC) 1223/2009, it can be read: “ The consumer should be
protected from misleading claims concerning efﬁcacy and other characteristics of cosmetic products.
uct [ 516–519].In the Cosmetic Regulation (EC) 1223/2009, it can be read: “ The consumer should beprotected from misleading claims concerning efﬁcacy and other characteristics of cosmetic products.In particular, Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market is applicable.
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 59 of 80Furthermore, the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, should deﬁne commoncriteria in relation to speciﬁc claims for cosmetic products .” [15].Considering the high number of cosmetic products available on the EU market, it isvery important to offer speciﬁc, understandable, and reliable information, substantiatedby using generally accepted methods, to enable consumers to make informed choices andcompare products to ﬁnd the ones that best suit their needs [ 15].This is the aim of the report provided by the European Commission about cosmeticclaims and advertising, which are considered essential tools necessary to inform consumersabout the qualities and characteristics of each cosmetic product [ 15,520].Through the label present on the packaging, consumers are informed about theproduct and its features. Therefore, the ingredients, its use, period after opening (PAO),
storage, beneﬁcial effects, claims, warnings, etc. must be reported [ 476,521–525]. Moreover,product claims are also used by cosmetic companies to differentiate their products fromcompetitors; thus, the claim should contribute to stimulating innovation and competitionamong companies [ 15,526,527].For cosmetic products’ claims that meet their purposes adequately, it is important tohave a well-organized framework that ensures that these claims are fair and do not misleadconsumers when considering the context and the marketing tools (printed material, a TVadvertisement, or the use of new media such as the internet or smartphones) in which suchclaims are shown [ 15,527].To respect social, linguistic, and cultural diversity, a ﬂexible approach for communicat-ing the messages to end users should be followed. Indeed, the marketing communicationsshould be clear, precise, relevant, and understandable by the target audience [ 527].
For this purpose, competent authorities tasked with market surveillance must be ableto easily verify all claims based on harmonized common criteria at the EU level [ 15].As reported in the CTPA Guide to Cosmetic Advertising Claims (2018), the CosmeticProducts Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 and (EU) Commission Regulation No 655/2013 onCommon Criteria for Claims introduced particular and speciﬁc requirements about claimsfor cosmetic products [ 471].The claims must conform to the Common Criteria and be legally compliant, truth-ful, supported by evidence, honest, fair, and allow informed decision-making by con-sumers [ 471].The measures provided by Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 agree with the StandingCommittee on Cosmetic Products’ opinion. However, it should be considered that thecommon criteria should be applied only to products deﬁned as cosmetic products accordingto Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009. A gap of knowledge should be resolved with
the aim of deﬁning the attribution of each product to a certain category. For example, thereis a concrete risk that products are wrongly considered cosmetics when, in fact, they aremedical devices or medicines [ 15].Hence, the Member States agree on a case-by-case basis whether a product can beconsidered a cosmetic or not [ 15].After deﬁning neurocosmetics and their action mechanisms in the previous para-graphs, and cosmetic products according to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) 1223/2009, somedoubts may arise regarding the fact that in order for the cosmetic to carry out its functions,it is “ intended to be placed in contact with the external parts of the human body ” [528–530], whilefor neurocosmetics the place of action does not seem clear.In general, to exploit their action, the neurocosmetic ingredients should pass throughthe dermis—the layer just below the epidermis; thus, starting from these preliminaryconsiderations, some questions arise:
considerations, some questions arise:How could we deﬁne neurocosmetics?Should this feature lead us to think of neurocosmetics as drugs?Should they be considered as “borderline products”?
considerations, some questions arise:How could we deﬁne neurocosmetics?Should this feature lead us to think of neurocosmetics as drugs?Should they be considered as “borderline products”?As for the United States, it is too early to determine the Food and Drug Administra-tion’s position in this regard. The current difference between cosmetics, quasi-drugs, and
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 60 of 80pharmaceutical products makes it difﬁcult for the manufacturing ingredient companies tomake progress, in a short time, in the neurocosmetic ﬁeld.Everything depends on what is declared both on the label—especially from the claimspoint of view—and when the product must be advertised (example: anti-stress, massageaction, aromatherapy in the case of a particular neurocosmetic fragrance, even if the“aromatherapy” is improperly deﬁned as neurocosmetics).By considering the deﬁnition of a cosmetic product according to Article 2 of Regulation(EC) 1223/2009 [ 531], “a substance or mixture intended to be ingested, inhaled, injected orimplanted into the human body should be not considered a cosmetic product ” [532]; there is a cleardifference both for products intended to be applied to different sites or for product usesthat go beyond the cosmetic sphere.Indeed, sometimes, it may not be entirely clear whether a given product is a cosmetic
within the meaning of Regulation (EC) 1223/2009, or if it falls under other regulations.In the case of these products deﬁned as “borderline products”, the classiﬁcation decisionmust be made on a case-by-case basis. A case-by-case evaluation of the product’s features—including absorption, concentration, route of administration, frequency of application, ap-plication site, and the degree of penetration, if considering the delivery pathway—shouldbe carried out by the competent national authority in order to decide the product qualiﬁca-tion. For example, it often happens that products—such as hair regrowth products—areincorrectly classiﬁed as cosmetics. To harmonize the qualiﬁcation of the products acrossthe Single Market, and to determine whether the product falls within the deﬁnition givenin Article 2 [ 527], several guidance documents have been produced by the European Com-mission about the delimitation between cosmetic products and other product categories,
e.g., medicines (governed by legislation Medicinal Products Directive 2001/83/EC) [ 533],biocidal products (governed by Biocidal Products Regulation 528/2012) [ 534], or medicaldevices (governed by EU Regulation on Medical Devices 745/2017) [ 535].The European Commission has published guidance documents to facilitate the ap-plication of the legislation in these cases, publishing the borderline manual for cosmeticproducts (Manual of the Working Group on Cosmetic Products (Sub-Group on BorderlineProducts) on the scope of application of the Cosmetics Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 [ 531].This manual is updated periodically with the addition, for example, of other categoriesor practical examples. Thus, the manual of borderline products helps to answer thequestion: “ is this product a cosmetic or does it fall under other regulations? ” [531]. The latestupdate was published in February 2020, and it is related to version 5.1 [ 536].
However, it is worth mentioning that, as indicated in the text of the manual, it is notlegally binding, and does not represent an ofﬁcial document of the European Commission.It should be interpreted more as an orientation manual—a practical collection of exam-ples to be applied case-by-case that can support both cosmetic industries and competentauthorities [ 536].The manual is based on three aspects related to cosmetics:• Product type;• Application site;• Cosmetic purpose.An example that can be found in this manual concerns anti-wrinkle cosmetic products:Speciﬁcally, the question is: “ are anti-wrinkle products cosmetics? ”. As a whole, anti-wrinkle products can be cosmetic products if they are mentioned in Regulation (EC)No 1223/2009 [ 15]. However, some products presented as anti-wrinkle that can restore,correct, or signiﬁcantly modify physiological functions by exercising a pharmacological,immunological, or metabolic action would not qualify as cosmetics [ 536].
The regulation will continue to support the innovations in anti-age skincare products.
immunological, or metabolic action would not qualify as cosmetics [ 536].The regulation will continue to support the innovations in anti-age skincare products.There is still much to learn about the skin and topical applications of functionalcosmetic ingredients.
Cosmetics 2021 ,8, 66 61 of 80Today, it is difﬁcult to harmonize the regulation of cosmetic products globally; indeed,for example, compliance with Chinese regulation represents a limiting problem for novelfunctional ingredients.What may be possible in the near future for topical skincare?7. ConclusionsAs B. Carli (2017) wrote, how we feel inside is reﬂected by how we look outside [ 334].Today, science’s progress helps to improve the appearance and wellbeing of skin,particularly with the beneﬁts offered by using neurocosmetic ingredients.Since the information about the deﬁnition of neurocosmetics is often confused, espe-cially by the marketing ﬁeld, this review has been focused on the concept of neurocosmetics,highlighting the importance of the ancestral biological and physiological connection be-tween skin and brain; an outline on psychosomatics better explains this link.An overview of the neurosciences and their applications in the cosmetic ﬁeld, particu-
larly related to cosmetic product pleasantness, is described.Technical information (i.e., company/supplier, physico-chemical characteristics, func-tionality categories, recommended use level, formulation/processing, claim ideas, beneﬁts,proven efﬁcacy demonstrated by in vitro , ex vivo, and in vivo tests, compliances) on mar-keted neurocosmetic ingredients in skincare products—mainly targeted for anti-agingcosmetic treatments—has been reported. The cosmetic products’ regulatory status andthe importance of the safety assessment of cosmetics to guarantee their quality, efﬁcacy,and safety have been evidenced. More speciﬁcally, the challenge for neurocosmetics isto formulate ideal multitasking products, suitable for each consumer’s skin type, whilerespecting their anatomical and physiological assets (hormonal and genetic factors, skinthickness, age, skin complexion), without forgetting to analyze their behaviors (smoking)
or environmental exposure (extrinsic factors). Thus, new and interesting advances arepresented as a great opportunity for cosmetic companies. The next step of this emergingtrend is the innovation in researching and developing new methodologies, strategies, andtechniques to formulate cosmetic products that will allow the discovery of a new world ofbeneﬁts and claims.Consumers are excited about new experiences that can introduce them to an uncon-ventional beauty routine that also meets their requests in lowering the associated costs.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, J.G. and V .R.; methodology, V .R.; validation, V .R., J.G.,and P .F.; formal analysis, P .C.; resources, J.G. and P .C.; writing—original draft preparation, J.G.;writing—review and editing, P .C. and V .R.; supervision, P .C.; project administration, P .C.
