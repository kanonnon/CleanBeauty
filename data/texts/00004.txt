HorikawaDivision of Dermatology, Graduate School of Medicine, Translational Medicine, School of Medicine, Kobe Uni versity, Kobe, JapanAbstractSolar radiation induces acute and chronic reactions in human and animal skin. Chronic repeated exposures are theprimary cause of benign and malignant skin tumors, including malignant melanoma. Among types of solar radiation,ultra violet B (290 /C1/320 nm) radiation is highly mutagenic and carcinogenic in animal experiments compared toultra violet A (320 /C1/400 nm) radiation. Epidemiological studies suggest that solar UV radiation is responsible for skintumor de velopment via gene mutations and immunosuppression, and possibly for photoaging. In this re view, recentunderstanding of DNA damage caused by direct UV radiation and by indirect stress via reacti ve oxygen species (ROS)
and DNA repair mechanisms, particularly nucleotide excision repair of human cells, are discussed. In addition,mutations induced by solar UV radiation in p53,rasandpatched genes of non-melanoma skin cancer cells, and the roleof ROS as both a promoter in UV-carcinogenesis and an inducer of UV-apoptosis, are described based primarily on thefindings reported during the last decade. Furthermore, the effect of UV on immunological reaction in the skin isdiscussed. Finally, possible pre vention of UV-induced skin cancer by feeding or topical use of antioxidants, such aspolyphenols, vitamin C, and vitamin E, is discussed.#2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.Keywords: Ultra violet light (UV); DNA damage; DNA repair; Reacti ve oxygen species (ROS); Nucleotide excision repair (NER);Transcription-coupled repair (TCR); UV-apoptosis; Protein kinase C (PKC); Immunosuppression; Oli ve oil; Pre vention; Mutation1. IntroductionChronic repeated exposures to sunlight from
Chronic repeated exposures to sunlight fromchildhood are epidemiologically shown to be themain cause of skin cancers. Ultra violet B radiation(UVB), a minor component of sunlight reaching tothe earth surface, is experimentally demonstratedto be the most effecti ve light to induce skin cancerin animals, and can cause DNA damage, particu-larly cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and(6/C1/4) photoproducts which induce mutation in theepidermal cells, leading to the de velopment ofcancer cells.UVB is also known to upregulate gene expres-sion through intracellular signal transductionpathways, which may contribute to de velopingskin cancer at the tumor promotion stage. Inaddition, UVB is pro ved to suppress immunereaction, and to induce tolerance to antigens,* Corresponding author.

which had been applied topically or systemically inexperimental animals. These three effects of UVBon the skin are understood to cooperati velycontribute to producing skin cancer in humans.Ultra violet light A (UVA) and UVB radiationare pro ved to produce DNA damage directly andindirectly through oxidati ve stress. Further, reac-tive oxygen species (ROS) are shown to acti vatetranscription factors, such as AP-1 and NFkB,which may contribute to cell proliferation and/orapoptotic cell death. In this re view, roles of ROSfor UV-induced skin cancer de velopment andpossible pre ventive effects of antioxidants onUV-carcinogenesis are discussed.2. DNA damage caused by UV radiation and ROSThe most cytotoxic and mutagenic wa vebandamong types of solar radiation corresponds toUVB light. DNA bases directly absorb incidentphotons within this narrow wa velength range. The
phototoxic effect of UVA radiation is much lowerthan UVB radiation. DNA is not a chromophorefor UVA radiation ( Rosenstein and Mitchell,1987 ), but could be damaged by photosensitizationreaction initiated through absorption of UVA byunidentified chromophore.2.1. Effect of UVB light on DNAA number of studies using UVC radiation (254nm) ha ve been conducted to demonstrate the effectof UV on DNA ( Mitchell et al., 1991 ), since UVCis close to the maximum absorption spectrum ofDNA to initiate photochemical reactions and isalso a vailable as nearly monochromatic lightsource. The effects of UVB radiation on DNAare mostly caused by the formation of dimericphotoproducts between adjacent pyrimidine baseson the same strand ( Fig. 1 ). The major class oflesions produced is cis/C1/syn CPDs. Pyrimidine /C1/pyrimidone (6 /C1/4) photoproducts [(6 /C1/4) pp] arethe second most pre valent adducts formed inDNA by UVB radiation ( Mitchell, 1988; Clingen
DNA by UVB radiation ( Mitchell, 1988; Clingenet al., 1995 ). The yield of (6 /C1/4) pp is 5 /C1/10-fold lessthan that of CPDs ( Eveno et al., 1995 ). (6/C1/4) ppare con verted to Dewar isomers by UVB rediation.(6/C1/4) Adducts exhibiting a cytosine at their 5 ?-endmay undergo deamination. The number of CPDsformed in a basal cell of human epidermis afterexposure to three minimal doses of solar lightabout 60 min exposure at noon in the summer inKobe, Japan (34 8N) is calculated to be approxi-mately 100 000 per cell ( Ichihashi et al., 1998 ).Among CPDs, thymine /C1/cytosine (TC) andcytosine /C1/cytosine (CC) dimers are shown to bethe most mutagenic, since TC 0 /TT and CC 0 /TTmutations are frequently found in the p53 gene ofUV-induced cancer cells ( Daya-Grosjean et al.,1995 ). In the case of TT dimers, the major UV-induced photoproducts in humans are poorlymutagenic, since DNA polymerase preferentially
mutagenic, since DNA polymerase preferentiallyincorporates ‘A’ residue opposite to non-instruc-tional lesions, restoring the original seguence (A /C1/T). (6/C1/4) pp may be less mutagenic, since it isrepaired efficiently compared to CPDs. Actually,90% (6 /C1/4) pp are shown to be repaired at 3 h afterirradiation ( Nakagawa et al., 1998 ). In addition topyrimidine photoproducts, and adenine residue,which can either dimerize with an adjacent adenineor add to an adjacent thymine upon exposure toUVB radiation. The quantum yields of thesephotoproducts are very low, but these may con-tribute to the biological effects of UV light, sinceadenine /C1/thymine adduct is shown to be mutagenic(Zhao and Taylor, 1996 ).Fig. 1. Adjacent pyrimidine bases on the same stand pyrimi-dine dimer ( Fig. 1 a) or (6 /C1/4) pyrimidine /C1/pyrrimidone photoproduct ( Fig. 1 b) alter absorbing UVB light energy.M.

2.2. DNA damage caused by ROSPurine photoadducts ha ve recently attracted theattention of photobiologists because the oxidationof guanine occurs upon exposure of isolated DNAto UVC and UVB light, in the absence of aphotosensitizer. This may be accounted for bythe formation of singlet oxygen from the tripletstate of purine and pyrimidine bases, only acontribution of an electron transfer at the nucleo-side le vel (Ito and Kawanishi, 1997 ). Electrontransfer or singlet molecular oxygen produced byUVB and UVA radiation targets DNA baseguanine, gi ving rise to 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine(8-OHdG) in the strand DNA ( Cadet et al., 2000 ).8-OHdG ( Fig. 2 ) is shown to be a ubiquitousmaker of oxidati ve stress ( Kasai and Nishimura,1984 ) since it can be generated under variousagents including peroxynitrite,.OH radical, one-electron oxidation oxidants and singlet oxygen.8-OHdG is a miscoding lesion causing G to Ttrans version although it represents only a minor
trans version although it represents only a minorfraction of UV-induced mutation, e ven in theUVA region ( Cheng et al., 1992 ). UV radiationalso induces a much wider range of DNA damage,such as protein-DNA crosslinks, single strandbreaks, and thymine glycol.3. DNA repair mechanisms in human skinImportant mechanisms in human cells to a voidthe potential mutation in UV-induced-damagedsites are to completely repair the damage bynucleotide excision repair (NER) before replica-tion, or synthesize DNA using postreplicationrepair specific DNA polymerase which is freefrom error. NER is a highly conser ved strategyfor repairing a variety of bulky DNA damages,such as CPDs and (6 /C1/4) pp ( Mitchell et al., 1985;Wood, 1997 ). Base change, such as 8-OHdG, isrepaired by base excision repair (BER) system(Wood, 1996; Krokan et al., 1997 ) using glycosy-lase in combination with replication protein A(RPA), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)and AP endonuclease.
The importance of NER for pre vention of UV-induced skin cancer and benign tumors is welldocumented by an extremely high occurrence ofskin cancer and seborrheic keratoses on sun-exposed areas in xeroderma pigmentosum (XP)patients who ha ve defecti ve NER ( Clea ver, 1968;Robbins et al., 1974; Ichihashi et al., 1988; Sijberset al., 1996 ). Complementation studies, using newpatient’s cells with the cells assigned to each ofXPs, re vealed that at least 7 gene products ofcomplementation groups (A /C1/G) except XP variantgene product (DNA polymerase h)(Masutani etal., 1999 ) are in volved in NER ( Table 1 ).NER is a complex process in volving more than30 gene products in which the following fi ve stepsare identified ( Aboussekhra et al., 1995 ): (1)recognition of a DNA lesion; (2) single strandincision at both sides flanking the lesion; (3)excision of a single stranded DNA nucleotide(possibly 24 /C1/32 bases); (4) DNA repair synthesis
/32 bases); (4) DNA repair synthesisto replace the excised DNA lesion; and (5) ligationof remaining single stranded nick ( Fig. 2 ). Further,it was found that the focal, not diffusely spread,nuclear localization of unscheduled DNA synth-esis takes place during the first and second 3 hrepair periods ( Nakagawa et al., 1998 ).Recently, the immunomodulatory mediator IL-12 has been shown to enhance NER acti vity,suggesting a possible role of cytokines in NER(Schwarz et al., 2002 ). The encoded protein byXPC gene was shown to be tightly associated withFig. 2. The major DNA lesions produced by oxidati ve damage,8-oxoguanine, thymine glycol, pyrimidine hydrates and urea.M.

one of the two human homologues of the yeastRAD23B (hHR23B) ( Sugasawa et al., 1998 ). It isvery likely that the XPC /C1/HR23B complex isessential to recognize DNA lesions in the genome,and XPA /C1/RPA complex participates in a laterrecognition step of the NER process. Binding ofXPC/C1/hHR23B to a DNA lesion induces localunwinding, enabling other repair proteins access tothe damaged site. In the next step, recruited TF IIH binds to XPC /C1/hHR23B complex as shown inFig. 1 . XPB and XPD proteins ha ve3?/C1 /5?and 5?/C1 /3?helicase acti vity. The damage site is incised byXPG and XPF-ERCC-1 complex proteins at 3 ?-and 5 ?-incisions sites, respecti vely, althoughwhether the 5 ?- and 3 ?-incision can be madeindependently from each other, remains to besolved.

by DNA polymerase dando. Finally, DNA ligase1 might be carrying out the ligation of the repairpatch ( de Boer and Hoeijimakers, 2000 ). XPE geneproduct is suggested to be in volved in NER bybinding to the DNA damaged site, so it isrecognized as a damaged DNA binding protein(DDB). There are two proteins in volved in thebinding acti vity, p125 (DDB1) and p48 (DDB2)(Nichols et al., 1996; Reardon et al., 1993 ).Hwanget al. (1998) suggested that the p48 protein isessential for CPDs, which was been shown tomutat in XPE cells. DDB heterodimers are notinvolved in the repair of (6 /C1/4) pp of globalgenome.There are two other hereditary human diseasesassociated with a defect in NER: Cockayne’ssyndrome (CS) and a photosensiti vity form oftrichothiodystrophy (TTD). Some patients showthe combined features of XP and CS. The strikingdifference between these two diseases is that XPpatients de velop UV-induced skin cancer, whereas
CS and TTD patients do not, despite their photo-sensiti vity. CS ( Clea ver and Kraemer, 1995 )i sarare photosensiti ve disorder with defecti ve NERhaving a wide variety of clinical symptoms includ-ing dwarfism and neurological abnormalities, butnot associated with an enhanced incidence of skincancer. At the cellular le vel, CS cells are hyper-sensiti ve to the cytotoxic and mutagenic effects ofUV and are characterized by delayed reco very ofDNA and RNA synthesis after UV exposure(Mayne and Lehmann, 1982 ). It is extremelyrare, but mutations in XPB ,XPD orXPG genescan lead to a combined XP /C1/CS phenotype. TTDpatients, also called PIBIDS, show photosensiti v-ity, ichthyosis, sulfur-deficient brittle hair andnails, intellectual impairment, decreased fertility,and short stature. PIBIDS patients ha ve mutationsin XPB or XPD gene, components of TF II H,suggesting that these genes are in volved in bothDNA repair and DNA transcription. It is reason-
DNA repair and DNA transcription. It is reason-able to assume that mutations that only affectDNA repair function of XPD could lead to XP,whereas in XP /C1/CS and TTD (at least) thetranscription function is modified, and therefore,also the transcription-coupled repair (TCR) path-way ( van Steeg and Kraemer, 1999 ).Eveno et al.(1995) have found that se veral cell lines fromPIBIDS display wild-type or nearly wild-type(50/C1/70%) repair of (6 /C1/4) pp in global genomerepair (GGR), suggesting a role of (6 /C1/4) pp repairin pre venting skin cancer formation in TTD. Asalready mentioned, two NER pathways are knownto exist, GGR and TCR ( Bohr et al., 1985 )(Fig.3).3.1. Transcription-coupled repairRecently, links between DNA damage, repairand transcription began to be disclosed in prokar-yotic and eukaryotic cells. Bohr et al. (1985) foundthat UV-induced CPDs in acti vely transcribing
that UV-induced CPDs in acti vely transcribinggenes is preferentially repaired compared to non-transcribing parts of the genome in hamster andhuman cells. Subsequently, it was shown thatrapid repair was targeted to the transcribed strandof an acti ve gene ( Vreeswijk et al., 1994 ). Theprecise mechanisms underlying TCR is not clearyet, but CSA and CSB gene products are essentialfor TCR. Another factor required for TCR isRNA polymerase II installed at a DNA damagedsites. CS cells show a specific defect in the rapidrepair of CPDs in the transcribed strand of acti vegenes. TF II H has dual function in NER andinitiation of transcription.3.2. Global genome repairGGR acts on DNA lesions throughout thegenome. XPC protein is essential for the damagerecognition and repair of both CPDs and (6 /C1/4)photoproducts by GGR ( Sancar, 1994 ). Thedamage recognition is a rate-limiting step in theprocess, and depends on the extent of distortion ofDNA helical structure by a lesion. (6 /C1
/4) pp isrepaired much faster than CPDs, possibly due tosevere distortion of the DNA helix. Further, it hasbeen recently shown that heterodimer DDB isessential for GGR for initial recognition of CPDs,but not for (6 /C1/4) pp.3.3. Base excision-repair for ROS-induced DNA

remo ved primarily by BER pathway. BER is amultistep process in volving the sequential acti vityof se veral proteins. Typically, this pathway isinitiated by a DNA glycosylase, a protein thatrecognizes and remo ves a damaged base, such as 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) ( Aburatani et al., 1997 ),uracil, or incorrect base by hydrolyzing the N-glycosidic bond. In some cases, DNA glycosylasesexhibit not only N-glycosylase acti vity, but alsoincise at the resulting apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP)site, clea ving 3?to the abasic residue. In Esherichiacoli, three enzymes, Mut M, Mut Y and Mut T,are known to repair errors in DNA caused by 8-oxoG. Mut M protein excises 8-oxoG paired withcytosine in DNA and initiates BER, and MutYprotein excises adenine paired with 8-oxo-G ( Kro-kan et al., 1997; Wilson and Thompson, 1997 ).Human cells also ha ve similar repair equipment,OGG1 gene ( Nishimura, 2002 ), encoding an 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase (a functional human
oxoG DNA glycosylase (a functional humanhomolog of Mut M protein). There are 7 splicedforms of OGG1. Among these, hOGG1-1a (36Fig. 3. NER pathways in mammalian cells. GGR and TCR pathways are known to exist in mammalian cells. XPC protein may play acrucial role in the GGR pathway by binding to hHR23B and then binds together to the DNA damaged site. XPA, TF II H2, RPA andDDB2 are expected to ser ve as essential common factors in NER pathways.M. Ichihashi et al. / Toxicology 189 (2003) 21 /C1/39 26
kDa) is located in the nucleus, while a 40-kDapolypeptide corresponding to a processed form ofOGG1-2a is located on the inner membrane of themitochondria. It has been shown by using purifiedhuman proteins that efficient and complete repairof 8-oxoG lesions requires only hOGG1, the APendonuclease HAP1, DNA polymerase (Pol) betaand DNA ligase 1. Addition of PCNA had a slightstimulatory effect on repair. Further, in the pre-sence of DNA ligase 1 ( Pascucci et al., 2002 ), therepair was confined to 1 nt replacement. CellularhOGG1-1a-mediated BER acti vity is inhibited byexposure to NO which nitrosylates hOGG-1through zinc ejection ( Suzuki et al., 1998 ). NOgenerated after UV exposure not only causes DNAdamage, but also pre vents DNA repair, leading tohigher mutation and risk of carcinogenesis.Further, recent studies indicate that two majoroxidati ve DNA damages, 8-oxoG and thymineglycol are excised from DNA in vitro by the sameenzyme system responsible for remo ving pyrimi-
enzyme system responsible for remo ving pyrimi-dine dimers and other bulky DNA adducts.Neurodegeneration of XP patients could be causedby defecti ve repair of DNA lesions that are causedin neuronal cells by ROS ( Reardon et al., 1997 ).4. Mutations induced by UVB in NMSC cellsThe general understanding of carcinogenic me-chanisms is the hypothesis of clonal expansion of acell ha ving mutations of oncogenes and tumorsuppressor genes ( Rees, 1994 ). Oncogenes andtumor suppressor genes are suggested to ha vecrucial roles on the control of the cell cycle,maintenance of gene integrity, cell proliferationand differentiation. These genes are also categor-ized into two groups, gatekeeper genes whichusually control cellular proliferation and regulateapoptosis, such as Rb,APC and p53 , and care-taker genes which maintain the integrity of thegenomes, such as XP,MMR ,CS,ATM ,BRCA-1, and BRCA-2 (Levitt and Hickson, 2002 ).CPDs and (6 /C1/4) pp produced by solar UVB
CPDs and (6 /C1/4) pp produced by solar UVBradiation are mostly repaired effecti vely withoutmistake, but incorrect repair of these lesions rarelyinduces mutations of oncogenes, such as rasandtumor suppressor genes, such as p53 orPTCH .These mutations render cells to transform and toimmortalize, leading to malignant tumor cells. Thereal mutations in these genes are demonstrated inbasal and squamous cell carcinoma cells in hu-mans ( Rees, 1994; Le vitt and Hickson, 2002;Campbell et al., 1993 ). CPDs and (6 /C1/4) pp arethe major mutagenic photoproducts, which gi verise to mutations characterized by C to T and CCto TT transitions located at sites of pyrimidine /C1/pyrimidine sequences ( Miller, 1985; Ziegler et al.,1993 ). The CC to TT tandem mutation is anabsolutely specific marker of UV-induced genealteration. These mutations are recognized to be asignature of sun exposure ( Brash et al., 1991 ).C to T transition and CC to TT tandem
C to T transition and CC to TT tandemmutation are found in p53 and PTCH tumorsuppressor genes ( Gailani et al., 1996 ) and rasoncogene ( Nishigori et al., 1994; Brash et al., 1996 )isolated from skin cancer de veloped on sun-exposed areas. Mutation of p53 in human subjectsisvery frequently found, more than 90% ofsquamous cell carcinoma (SCCs) and around50% of BCCs suggesting an essential role ofwild-type p53 gene product for keeping cells innormal conditions ( Brash et al., 1996 ). Similarresults ha ve been obtained in skin tumors thathave been isolated from XP patients.p53 mutation site of non-XP subjects is equallydivided o ver both transcribed and non-transcribedstrands, whereas p53 mutation site of skin tumorfrom XP patients mostly distributed on the non-transcribed strands ( Kraemer, 1997 ). In a study onPTCH gene mutation of XP subjects with mostlyXPC, 63% of the mutation was CC to TT tandem
XPC, 63% of the mutation was CC to TT tandemmutations, compared to 11% in non-XP BCC(Kraemer, 1997 ). These results of XP patientsmay be due to study bias analyzing mostly XPCsubjects who ha ve GGR defect of NER.Mutations on p53 seem to be an early e vent inUV-induced skin carcinogenesis, since p53 muta-
may be due to study bias analyzing mostly XPCsubjects who ha ve GGR defect of NER.Mutations on p53 seem to be an early e vent inUV-induced skin carcinogenesis, since p53 muta-tion is found in nearly 50% of actinic keratosis(AK) ( Taguchi et al., 1994; Ziegler et al., 1994 ),premalignant stage of SCC. By immunohisto-chemical analysis, we showed that approximately50% of cases of AK and SCC were positi ve for p53protein ( Nagano, et al., 1993 ), although proteinstaining of p53 by antibodies does not alwaysindicate a point mutation in p53gene. Ziegler et al.M. Ichihashi et al. / Toxicology 189 (2003) 21 /C1/39 27
(1994) showed that 24 out of 45 AK tissue sampleshad a total of 35 mutations. Further, they foundthat 89% the mutations occurred adjacent topyrimidines and most were C to T or CC to TTalterations characteristic of UV mutations.Further, it has been found that p53 mutationsare higher in normal skin on sun-exposed areaswithout any pathological abnormalities comparedto those on co vered areas, by analyzing mutationsat codon 247/248 of the p53 gene using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction ( Ouhtit et al.,1997 ). In addition, the mutation frequency in theage group o ver 60 years was higher than that in theyounger group. Since mutated p53 is not able toinduce apoptotic cell death which eliminatesheavily damaged cells ha ving higher possibility ofmutations in any other genes, Brash et al. (1996)proposed that p53 mutated cells on sun-exposedskin must exhibit clonal expansion, due to accu-mulation of changes in other genes.Patched gene ( PTCH ) was first identified to
Patched gene ( PTCH ) was first identified tomutate in BCC of ne void basal cell carcinomasyndrome ( Hahn et al., 1996; Johnson et al., 1996 )and later in sporadic BCC ( Aszterbaum et al.,1998 ). Initially, PTCH was isolated in drosophilaas a segment polarity gene in volved in the de vel-opment and differentiation. The PTCH geneencodes a transmembrane protein (12 membranespanning domain with two extra-cellular loops)similar to the ABC transporter family. The sonichedgehog protein, a ligand of PTCH protein,binds to PTCH receptor and depri ves the inhibi-tory function of PTCH protein on the smoothened(SMO) protein, ha ving se ven span transmembraneprotein, leading to TGF- band WNT familyactivations ( Fig. 4 ).PTCH has been shown tomutant in around 50 /C1/60% of sporadic BCC ( Radyet al., 1992 ). We found a high le vel of PTCHmutation by competiti ver e verse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in BCC, but not inother skin tumors except in a Bowen’s disease,
indicating that the PTCH gene plays a crucial rolein BCC genesis ( Nagano et al., 1999 ). Further-more, o verexpression of SHH was shown toinduce BCC in mice ( Dahmane et al., 1997 ), andmutation of SMO gene was also identified insporadic BCC ( Xie et al., 1998 ). These findingsindicate an important role of SMO as a signalingmolecule of the SHH-receptor complex and pro-vide direct e vidence that mutated SMO gene canfunction as an oncogene in BCCs. Xie et al. (2001)recently found that Gli1 can acti vate platelet-derived growth factor receptor a(PDGFR a)i nC3H10T1/2 cells. Functional upregulation ofPDGFR aby Gli1 is accompanied by acti vationof the ras-ERK pathway associated with cellproliferation. A high le vel of expression ofPGGFR ain BCCs of mice and humans arerelevant to a role of Gli1, the downstreammolecule of the SHH pathway. They suggestedthat increased expression of PDGFR amight play
a role in BCC genesis through altered hedgehogpathway. Typical UV-induced mutations of thePTCH are found prominently in XP’s BCC and inparticular, a significantly higher le vel of (63%) ofthe UV signature tandem mutations (CC 0/TT) isfound compared to sporadic BCC (11%) in healthysubjects ( Daya-Grosjean and Sarasin, 2000 ).5. ROS as promoter in UV-carcinogenesis and asinducer of UV-apoptosis5.1. Acti vation of MAP kinaseUltra violet radiation is a potent inducer ofsuperoxide radical (+O2/C28), hydrogen peroxide(H2O2) and hydroxy radical (+OH), which ha vebeen implicated in cutaneous aging includingbenign and malignant tumors, and various inflam-matory disorders ( Cerutti, 1985 ). UVB may pro-duce+O2/C28, and UVA may produce1O2possiblythrough chromophores, such as porphyrin in skin.Devary et al. (1992) showed that by UVC radia-tion, tyrosine kinases of the Src family increase,followed by acti vation of Ha-ras and increased
phosphorylation of Raf-1, then acti vate c-Jun andother AP-1 proteins. In this signaling cascade,ROS is suggested to play a crucial role, since the
phosphorylation of Raf-1, then acti vate c-Jun andother AP-1 proteins. In this signaling cascade,ROS is suggested to play a crucial role, since theantioxidant, N-acetylcystein (NAC), suppressedUVC-induced acti vation of mitogen-acti vated pro-tein kinases (MAPK) leading to AP-1 and NFkBactivation.

major role in initiating and coordinating thesegene responses.Three distinct MAPK signal transduction path-ways, the extracellular signal regulated kinases 1and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)and p38 MAPK, the mamalian homolog by yeastHOG1, also known as CSBP ha ve been identified(Xia et al., 1995; Su and Karin, 1996 ). ERKs areprimarily acti vated in response to growth factorsand phobor esters, and JNK participates in growthfactor signaling as well as responding to variousstress e vents such as UVR and inflammatorycytokines. p38 is known to be a stress-inducedsignaling pathway. ERK 1/2 and p38 signalingpathways are shown to be acti vated by UVB viaROS in cultured keratinocytes, although it is notclarified yet whether apoptosis signal-regulatingkinase 1, one of the acti vators of ERK is in volvedin UV-stress response ( Ichijo, 1999 ). The time-dependent acti vation of ERK1/2 and p38 aredistinct, and UVB-induced ERK1/2 acti vation is
distinct, and UVB-induced ERK1/2 acti vation isdownregulated more rapidly than p38. Ascorbicacid strongly blocks ERK1/2 and p38 acti vationby UVB and hydrogen peroxide ( Peus et al., 1999 ).Cell death by UVB radiation is rescued by ERK1/2activation, whereas inhibition for ERK1/2 in-creases UV-induced cell death.H2O2is produced in the cells following UVBirradiation and stimulates phosphorylation ofEGFR, suggesting an important role of H2O2incellular signaling ( Owen et al., 2000 ). H 2O2produced by UVB irradiation is considered tomediate ERK1/2 acti vation, since antioxidantsshown to inhibit UVB-induced H 2O2formationsuppresses ERK1/2 acti vation. H 2O2formed byUVB may mediate ERK1/2 acti vation throughupstream substances such as ras, raf and MEK 1and 2 after EGFR phosphorylation ( Peus et al.,1998 ). A substance, which inhibits UV-inducedERK1/2 acti vation and acti vates JNK after UVradiation, may play some role in pre venting UV-
radiation, may play some role in pre venting UV-carcinogenesis, possibly by enhancing apoptoticcell death.The effect on AP-1 transcription acti vity results,in part, from enhanced phosphorylation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal acti vation domain. JNK1, adistant relati ve of the MAP kinase group isactivated by dual phosphorylation at Thr andFig. 4. Proteins in sonic hedgehog signaling pathway are in volved in BBC tumor genesis. The binding of SHH to its receptor patched(PTCH), a 12-span transmembrane products of patched gene, releases the suppressi ve effect on smoothened (SMO protein). If PTCHor SMO is mutationally acti vated, SMO gets released from the membrane, more into the nucleus and acti vates transcription factor Gl-1 upregulating the expression of WNT, TGF band PTCH.M.

Tyr during UV response. JNK1 binds to the c-Juntranscription domain and phosphorylates it onSer-63 and Ser-73. This process is thought to beresponsible for UV-induced tumor promotion(Derijard et al., 1994 ).5.2. A role of PKC din UV-induced apoptosisMultiple signaling pathways appear to be in-volved in the apoptosis of keratinocytes followingUV exposure, including production of tumornecrosis factor- a(TNF- a), acti vation of CD95(FAS/APO-1) ( Aragane et al., 1998; Schwarz etal., 1995; Rehemtulla et al., 1997 ), and acti vationof MAPK, JNK. PKC is a serine/threonine /C1/protein kinase family consisting of more than 10isoforms ( Nishizuka, 1995 ), that is in volved in avariety of signal transduction pathways. The PKCisoforms ha ve the regulatory and catalytic do-mains in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal hal ves,respecti vely. PKC can be classified into three
respecti vely. PKC can be classified into threegroups, cPKC, nPKC and aPKC, based uponstructural differences in their regulatory domains,which require specific co-factor in each group.PKC dis one of the nPKC isoforms expressedubiquitously among the cells and tissues includingkeratinocytes ( Gherzi et al., 1992; Gshwendt,1999 ). Overexpression of the PKC isoform causesgrowth inhibition and differentiation in culturedcells ( Watanabe et al., 1992; Ohba et al., 1998 ). Inaddition, a proteolytic fragment of PKC dcontain-ing its catalytic domain is produced in cells inresponse to radiation and DNA damaging agents.The acti vation of aPKC isoforms is inhibited byUV exposure, and o verexpression of an aPKCisoforms can protect against UV-induced apopto-sis (Newton, 1995 ). aPKC isoforms ha ve also beenimplicated in the acti vation of AP-1 by UV light(Denning et al., 1995 ). PKC dis only expressed indifferentiating keratinocytes ( Koizumi et al.,
differentiating keratinocytes ( Koizumi et al.,1993 ). Acti vation or increased expression of PKCaand PKC dis linked to the differentiation(Koizumi et al., 1993; Ueda et al., 1996; Lee etal., 1997 ). In addition, cPKC and nPKC isoformsare the molecular target for tumor promotingphorbol esters in skin chemical carcinogenesis(Nishizuka, 1995, 1984 ). PKC dis acti vated byUVB radiation in normal human keratinocytes,and inhibition of PKC dsignificantly suppressedUV-induced apoptosis. Further, inhibition ofcaspases blocked the UV-induced clea vage ofPKC dand apoptosis, suggesting a pi votal roleof PKC dactivation as the UV-induced deatheffector in normal human keratinocytes ( Rehem-tulla et al., 1997 ).Recently, three tyrosine residues of PKC dcanbe phosphorylated by H2O2at Tyr-311 and Tyr-332 located in the hinge region between threeregular and catalytic domains and Try-512 in theactivation loop of the catalytic domain ( Konishi et
al., 2001 ). The phosphorylation at Tyr-311 site byLck, a non-receptor type tyrosine /C1/protein kinase,enhanced its basal enzymatic acti vity in theabsence of 1,2-diacylglycerol. Therefore, it seemsthat H2O2treatment induces tyrosine phosphor-ylation of PKC dand that the modificationreaction has a critical role for the generation ofthe catalytically acti ve form of the PKC isoformwithout proteolysis, that may contribute to apop-totic cell death ( Konishi et al., 2001 ).It has been shown that UVC irradiation inducesphosphorylation and acti vation of PKC dincultured HaCaT cells, although catalytic fragmentof PKC dis not generated. Further, UV-inducedapoptosis was pre vented by NAC, a potent radicalscavenger, and inhibited tyrosine phosphorylationof PKC dinduced by UV-radiation ( Fukunaga etal., 2001 ). It is likely that ROS generated in UV-irradiated cells facilitates the tyrosine phosphor-ylation reaction of PKC d, leading to promotion ofcell death.
cell death.Several non-receptor type tyrosine /C1/protein ki-nases such as Src, ZAP-70 ( Fukunaga et al., 2001 ),Pyk2 ( Tokiwa et al., 1996 )S y k( Qin et al., 1997 )and Btk ( Kawakami et al., 1998 ), and receptortype tyrosine /C1/protein kinases, such as epidermal
Pyk2 ( Tokiwa et al., 1996 )S y k( Qin et al., 1997 )and Btk ( Kawakami et al., 1998 ), and receptortype tyrosine /C1/protein kinases, such as epidermalgrowth factor receptor ( Sachsenmaier et al., 1994;Coffer et al., 1995 ), insulin receptor ( Warmuth etal., 1994 ), and c-Ret ( Kato et al., 2000 ) are alsoactivated by UV irradiation. Among these, it isrequired to determine which tyrosine /C1/proteinkinases phospholylates PKC din UV-irradiatedcells. In addition to PKC d, JNK, as describedalready, has also been demonstrated to participatein apoptosis process. It is plausible that PKC dpromotes UV-induced apoptosis in cooperationM.

with other protein kinases and cell death signalpathways.6. UV induces immunosuppression which may playa crucial role in skin cancer development6.1. Local and systemic immunosuppressionUVB at high doses and e ven such a low le vel asone minimal erythema dose (MED) can impairhost immune sur veillance for skin cancers inrodents possibly by modulating the expression ofco-stimulatory function of epidermal Langerhanscells (LCs) and lymphocytes. Initially, Fisher andKripke (1997) described that skin tumors de vel-oped in adult mice exposed to high dose of UVBradiation for prolonged periods of time wererejected when transplanted to syngenic healthymice, but continued to grow when transplanted tomouse skin pre-exposed to UVB radiation beforetumor cell transplantation. Further, mice chroni-cally exposed to UVB radiation displayed asystemic defect in antigen presentation ( Fig. 5 ).The ability of these mice to respond to alloantigensand to various other antigens was impaired.
and to various other antigens was impaired.In early 1980s, low doses of UVB radiationdelivered to the skin depri ved the ability torespond to hapten painted on irradiated skin sites,although haptens painted on untreated skin sitesinduced contact hypersensiti vity ( Elmets et al.,1983 ). Further, it was demonstrated that theunresponsi veness could be transferred with viablelymphocytes to naı ¨ve recipients, indicating thatsuppressor T cells may be responsible ( Fisher andKripke, 1982 ). The mechanisms of this localimmunosuppression are complex and proposedto in volve a number of components: (1) a directeffect on the antigen presenting acti vity of LCsand other antigen presenting cells in the skin(Simon et al., 1991; Kripke, 1984 ); (2) localproduction of immunomodulatory cytokines,TNF- a(Vermeer and Streilein, 1990 ); (3) theinfiltration of macrophages into the skin whichhave different antigen presenting capabilities from
the normal resident APC ( Cooper et al., 1993 ); and(4) in the case of suppression of the DTH responseto herpes virus injected locally into UV-irradiatedFig. 5. Systemic immunosuppression by high dose of UVB irradiation in mice. When hapten DNCB was painted on the intact skin ofthe mouse, which had recei ved a large dose of UVB in an another area 4 days before sensitization, the mouse ear challenged withDNCB did not show any response, suggesting systemic immunosuppression by a large dose of UVB irradiation.M. Ichihashi et al. / Toxicology 189 (2003) 21 /C1/39 31
skin site ( Howie et al., 1998 ), the isomerization ofurocanic acid to its immunosuppression cis-isomeris suggested to be responsible ( Norval et al., 1990 ).In systemic immunosuppression, it is suggestedthat DTH could be modulated by IL-10, possiblyreleased from UV-irradiated KC, and CHS mightbe modulated by TNF- a, since antibody againstIL-10 and TNF- asuppresses DTH and CHS,respecti vely, ( Rivas and Ullrich, 1992, 1994 ).IL-12 is known to induce TH1-specific immuneresponses and to inhibit the de velopment of TH2cells ( Trinchieri, 1998 ). IL-12 is also shown toovercome UVB-induced systemic immunosuppres-sion of CHS and DTH reactions ( Schmitt et al.,1995 ). The mechanisms of IL-12 to reco ver orprevent UVB-induced systemic immunosuppres-sion are not clear yet. We ha ve pre viously reportedthat IL-12 enhances the accessory cell function ofLCs in a mixed epidermal cell /C1/lymphocyte reac-tion resulting in augmentation of IFN- gproduc-
tion resulting in augmentation of IFN- gproduc-tion ( Suemoto et al., 1998 ). To address thequestion of whether pretreatment of APC withIL-12 could restore the TH1-type response inUVB-induced systemic immunosuppression, weanalyzed how IL-12 may restore the suppressedTH1-type response in mice with UVB-inducedsystemic immunosuppression. For this purpose,furthermore, using an in vitro system, we exam-ined the effects of IL-12 on APC function in UVB-induced systemic immunosuppression. We foundthat IL-12-pretreated APC could not restore thereduced IFN- gproduction.We further found that anti-CD3 mAB-inducedIFN- gproduction by T cells from UVB-irradiatedmice was not augmented in the presence of anti-CD28 mAb but IL-4 production was enhanced bythe addition of anti-CD28 mAb. Further, thereduced IFN- gproduction by T cells from UVB-irradiated mice in response to antigen plus APCwas restored by adding IL-12 to the culture. Ourresults indicate that UVB-induced systemic immu-
nosuppression in volves impaired Th1-type re-sponses of T cells through CD28 signaling, andthat IL-12 reco vers the impaired CD28 co-stimu-latory signaling in T cells resulting in the restor-arion of Th1 responses ( Ando et al., 2000 ).In early 1990s, it was shown that most skincancer patients exposed to UVB failed to de velopCHS to hapten, whereas about 60% of healthysubjects de veloped vigorous contact hypersensiti v-ity. These subjects who failed to induce immunereaction were called UV-susceptible, and about60% of healthy subjects who responded haptenvigorously were called UV-resistant. It was postu-lated that UV susceptibility might be a risk factorfor the de velopment of skin cancer ( Yoshikawa etal., 1990 ). These results demonstrate that UVradiation not only initiates and promotes epider-mal normal cell to cancer cell via effects on cellularDNA and intracellular signal transduction, butalso interferes with host immunity against thedevelopment of skin tumor cells.
6.2. DNA damage may trigger immunosuppressionDNA damage was proposed to initiate UV-induced immunosuppression by the followingevidence: (1) UV-induced suppression of CHS inAmerican opossum, whose DNA damage is re-paired by visible light-acti vated photoreacti vatingenzyme, was completely pre vented by exposingopossum skin to visible light immediately afterUVB irradiation ( Applegate et al., 1989 ); (2)topical application of T4N5 (bacteriophage T4endonuclease V, an excision repair enzyme forCPDs in DNA) to UVB-irradiated mouse skinprevented UVB-induced suppression of DTH andCHS responses and induction of suppressor T cells(Kripke et al., 1992 ); and (3) IL-10 which is shownto be responsible for systemic immune suppressionis produced by cultured KC after UV irradiation,but not by KC pretreated with T4N5 suggestingthat UV-induced DNA damage may trigger atleast in part the production of soluble immuno-suppressi ve mediators, such as IL-10 from KC(Nishigori et al., 1996 ).
(Nishigori et al., 1996 ).LC densities in chronically sun-exposed skin
least in part the production of soluble immuno-suppressi ve mediators, such as IL-10 from KC(Nishigori et al., 1996 ).LC densities in chronically sun-exposed skinwere remarkably reduced in patients with XPA,but only slightly in normal subjects compared withcovered skin. Further, a single irradiation of 3MEDs induced a large reduction of LCs in 3 /C1/7days in all subjects, but return to preirradiatedlevels was markedly delayed (28 days) in XPAsubjects compared to those (14 days) of normalhealthy subjects ( Jimbo et al., 1992 ). The similarmarked reduction of LC in XPA gene-knockoutM. Ichihashi et al. / Toxicology 189 (2003) 21 /C1/39 32
mouse after a small dose of UVB radiation wasobser ved by Miyauchi-Hashimoto et al. (1996) .I naddition, UV-induced local and systemic immu-nosuppression to contact hypersensiti vity wasgreatly enhanced in XPA/C28//C28mice. Enhancedsuppression of natural killer cells acti vity ofXPA/C28//C28mice exposed to UVB radiation wasalso demonstrated ( Miyauchi-Hashimoto et al.,1999 ).6.3. c-UCA may trigger UV-inducedimmunosuppressionUVB irradiation isomerizes urocanic acid,which may contribute to some of the earlyimmunosuppressi ve effects of UV, especially inrelevance to DTH responses ( Norval et al., 1995;Beissert et al., 1997 ). These e vents may cause thefailure of cutaneous APC to acti vate Th1 lympho-cytes leading to suppressed responses of DTH andCHS, although the exact mechanisms of inductionof APC dysfunction and suppresssor T cells arenot yet clear.7. Prevention of UV-induced skin cancer by feedingof and topical use of polyphenols, vitamin C, andvitamin E
7.1. Green tea and black teaGreen tea is one of the most common be veragesin the Asia. The principal chemical constituents ofgreen tea are polyphenols, containing ( /C28/)-epigal-locatechin (EGC), ( /C28 /)-epicatechin (EC), ( /C28 /)-epi-catechin-3-gallate (ECG) and ( /C28 /)-epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG) ( Wang et al.,1992; Yang and Wang, 1993 ). These componentsare shown to react with cytochrome P450 andinhibit catalytic acti vities in a dose dependentmanner.Epidemiological studies in Asian countriesshowed that high green tea consumers (10 cupsper day) had the low incidence of prostate andbreast cancers compared with those consume lessthan three cups of green tea per day.A wide-range of antioxidants has been shown tobe effecti ve in pre venting against photocarcino-genesis in murine skin. Polyphenols are wellknown antioxidants. Wang et al. (1994) demon-
known antioxidants. Wang et al. (1994) demon-strated that oral and topical application of poly-phenols before UVB irradiation protected miceskin from UV-induced skin cancer de velopment.Further, chronic oral feeding of polyphenols indrinking water was also shown to afford betterprotection against UV-carcinogenesis than topicaluse. Wang et al. (1991) also reported inhibitoryeffects of orally administered black tea, decaffei-nate green tea, and decaffeinate black tea on UV-induced benign and malignant tumor formation inSKH-1 mice. In addition, oral administration ofcaffeine had a strong inhibitory effect on UV-induced skin cancer formation.The anticancer effects of tea ha ve been attrib-uted to the antioxidant catechins and polyphenols,which may primarily regulate cell cycle progres-sion and induction of p53-dependent apoptosis(Huang et al., 1998 ). In 2001, Lu et al. (2000)
demonstrated that pretreatment of SKH-1 micewith 0.6% green tea (6 mg lyophilized tea solid perml) administered orally enhanced UV-inducedincreases in the number of p53-positi ve cells, p21/WAF-1/CIP-1 positi ve cells and apoptotic cells inepidermis. These effects may play a role in theinhibitory action of tea in UV-induced carcinogen-esis possibly eliminating cells, which may progressinto malignant cancer cells.UV radiation is a potent inducer of ROS, whichhave been implicated in photoaging and skincancer de velopment ( Beehler et al., 1992 ). H2O2and UVB radiation ha ve been reported to upre-gulate expression of genes such as c-fos and c-jun,via phosphorylation of, JNK and p38, leading tothe acti vation of AP-1 and NFkB, which increasecell sur vival (Raingeaud et al., 1995 ). The promot-ing effect of UV radiation-induced ERK acti va-tion is inhibited by anti-ROS agents, such asEGCG and ascorbic acid ( Peus et al., 1999 ).7.2. Phytic acid
7.2. Phytic acidPhytic acid, inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), foundubiquitously in plant and animal cells, has beenshown to reduce the rate of cellular proliferationboth in vivoa n di n vitro in human colon cancer(Huang et al., 1997 ). In addition, IP6 has beenM. Ichihashi et al. / Toxicology 189 (2003) 21 /C1/39 33
shown to inhibit UV-induced signal transduction,particularly blocked UVB-induced AP-1 andNFkB transcriptional acti vities ( Shamsuddin,1999 ). IP6 also suppressed UVB-induced phos-phorylation of ERK and JNKs, but not p38kinases ( Chen et al., 2001 ). Taken together, it issuggested that antioxidants, which enhance JNK-and suppress ERK-phosphorylation may increaseapoptotic cell death after exposure to UV radia-tion, pre venting skin cells from UV-induced carci-nogenesis.7.3. Oli ve oilIn the Mediterranean area where oli ve oil is thedietary fat of choice, the incidence of coronaryheart disease and certain cancer is low ( Visioli andGalli, 1995 ). Extra virgin oli ve oil, which isobtained from whole fruit, is rich in phenoliccompound ha ving potent anti-ROS acti vity.Vis-ioli et al. (1998) showed that hydroxytyrosal andoleuropein are potent sca vengers of+O2/C28and
oleuropein are potent sca vengers of+O2/C28andinhibitors of neutrophil respiratory burst. Oleur-opein has been reported to increase NO produc-tion from LPS-challenged mouse neurophils, andalso to remo ve+O2/C28, possibly pre venting theformation of peroxynitrite.Recently, we ha ve found that extra virgin oli veoil painted the mouse skin immediately after UVBradiation, significantly retarded the onset andreduced the number of skin cancer, but pretreat-ment with extra virgin oli ve oil and pre- or post-treatment by regular oli ve oil neither retarded norreduced skin cancer formation in UV-irradiatedmice. In addition, we showed that ROS-inducedDNA damage, 8-OHdG in mice epidermis after asingle irradiation of UVB (3.43 kJ/m2) was appar-ently reduced by extra virgin oli ve oil paintedimmediately after UV irradiation, whereas CPDpositi ve cells, and the grade of positi vity were notreduced by post-UV painting of extra virgin oli ve
oil (Budiyanto et al., 2000 ). In the next step, wefurther asked which components of oli ve oil areeffecti ve in reducing 8-OHdG production afterUVB-treatment. Oleuropein, but not hydroxytyr-osol and squalene, reduced 8-OHdG production(Ichihashi et al., 2001 ). These results suggest thatthe pre ventive effect of oli ve oil on UV-inducedskin cancer may be caused at least in part bypreventing cellular damage by ROS. We alsoconfirmed enhanced apoptotic cell death of UV-induced HaCaT cells pretreated with oleuropein(unpublished results).These results strongly suggest that topical use ofolive oil after sunbathing in humans may pre ventskin cancer formation by reducing ROS-inducedDNA damage. In the near future, howe ver, furtherstudies using animal and human skin to get resultswhich pro vide support for the pre ventive effect ofolive oil on UV-induced skin cancer should bemade before concluding that post-use of extravirgin oli ve oil is recommended to the public.
virgin oli ve oil is recommended to the public.8. ConclusionSkin cancers are mostly caused by chronicexposure to solar radiation, which induces acti va-tion of oncogenes and inacti vation of tumorsuppressorgenes. In addition, solar ultra violetradiation stimulates cell proliferation via signaltransduction initiated on cellular membrane. UVBand possibly UVA suppress immune responses,contributing to the de velopment of skin cancer.In this re view, we discussed a role of UV-induced DNA damage in skin carcinogenesis andalso recent ad vances in the understanding of themechanisms of DNA repair, particularly NER,which play a pi votal role in pre venting skincarcinogenesis. Further, we focused on the recentunderstanding of a role PKC and MAPKs in cellproliferation and apoptosis, initiated by ROS. Arole of UV-induced immunosuppression in skincarcinogenesis was also discussed. Our deep under-standing of the mechanisms of acute and chronic
standing of the mechanisms of acute and chronicskin damage caused by solar radiation helps us tofind pre ventive ways for cancer de velopment andphotoaging of the skin.
