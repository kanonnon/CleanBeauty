In view of this critical role in genomic integrity, the telomere’s own integrity should be of paramountimportance to the cell. Ultraviolet light (UV), the preeminent risk factor in skin cancer development, induces mainly
cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) which are both mutagenic and lethal. The human telomeric repeat unit (5 9TTAGGG/CCCTAA3 9) is nearly optimal for acquiring UV-induced CPD, which form at dipyrimidine sites. We developed a ChIP–basedtechnique, immunoprecipitation of DNA damage (IPoD), to simultaneously study DNA damage and repair in the telomereand in the coding regions of p53, 28S rDNA, and mitochondrial DNA. We find that human telomeres in vivo are 7-foldhypersensitive to UV-induced DNA damage. In double-stranded oligonucleotides, this hypersensitivity is a property of bothtelomeric and non-telomeric repeats; in a series of telomeric repeat oligonucleotides, a phase change conferring UV-sensitivity occurs above 4 repeats. Furthermore, CPD removal in the telomere is almost absent, matching the rate inmitochondria known to lack nucleotide excision repair. Cells containing persistent high levels of telomeric CPDs
nevertheless proliferate, and chronic UV irradiation of cells does not accelerate telomere shortening. Telomeres aretherefore unique in at least three respects: their biophysical UV sensitivity, their prevention of excision repair, and theirtolerance of unrepaired lesions. Utilizing a lesion-tolerance strategy rather than repair would prevent double-strand breaksat closely-opposed excision repair sites on opposite strands of a damage-hypersensitive repeat.Citation: Rochette PJ, Brash DE (2010) Human Telomeres Are Hypersensitive to UV-Induced DNA Damage and Refractory to Repair.

In humans, it is constituted of 5–10 kb of a repeatedhexamer (5 9TTAGGG/5 9CCCTAA). Telomeres are required forchromosomal stability and integrity (reviewed in [1]).Telomeres are hypersensitive to single-strand DNA damage

Telomeres are hypersensitive to single-strand DNA damageinduced by oxidative stress. This is thought to be due to the factthat sequences containing guanine triplets are highly sensitive tooxidation [2,3]. When inserted in a plasmid, telomere sequence is7-fold more sensitive to Fe2 +/H2O2-induced strand breakage thanbulk sequence [2]. Moreover, breaks induced in telomeres arerepaired significantly more slowly than in other sequences,including interstitial guanine rich repetitive sequence tracts; repairis still incomplete after 19 days compared to complete repair at 1day elsewhere [4]. In addition, the oxidation of telomeric DNAcontributes to their premature shortening. The frequency ofoxidative DNA damage at the telomere correlates with the amountof telomere lost during subsequent rounds of DNA replication [5].It was proposed that the telomere enters DNA replication with
greater oxidative DNA damage than the rest of the genome andthis elevated damage contributes to telomere shortening [6].Contrasting with this hypothesis, however, it has been shown thattelomere shortening induced by oxidative DNA damage can bereplication independent [3].Ultraviolet light-induced DNA damage has been used fordecades as a model to study DNA damage induction and repair. Itis biologically relevant because UV is a complete carcinogen,requiring no additional treatments for tumor development, and isthe preeminent risk factor in skin cancer development. The vastmajority ( .80%) of UV-induced damage in B-form DNA consistsof cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) [7,8]. CPDs are intra-strand DNA lesions formed when two adjacent pyrimidines arejoined across their 5–6 double bonds due to UV-excitation of oneof them. The most frequent is the TT cyclobutane dimer [9].These photoproducts are repaired by the nucleotide excisionrepair (NER) pathway, which nicks the DNA backbone and
excises the damaged segment. Theoretically, the telomeresequence constitutes a perfect target for UV-induced DNAdamage. First, the TT on the G-rich strand is repeated thousandsof times in each chromosome. On the other strand, the59CCCTAA3 9would nominally generate low frequency CC andCT CPD, but two factors supervene: tracts of adjacent pyrimidinesPLoS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 1 April 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | e1000926
tend to generate multiple CPDs on the same molecule, due tocooperative denaturation of the helix by each successive CPD [10]and A:T tracts tend to transfer energy down the base stack untildepositing it at a G:C pair [11,12]. These potential CCCT dimertracts are again repeated thousands of times in each chromosome.These considerations suggested that this sequence might constitutea hotspot for UV-induced damage. The presence of potentialhotspots on both telomeric strands then raises the followingspectre: if the cell attempts to simultaneously repair two nearbyCPDs on opposite strands, the twin incision nicks would mimic adouble-strand DNA break [13–15], triggering a DNA damageresponse and chromosome aberrations [16,17].Studying DNA damage induction and repair in the telomere ischallenging. The vast majority of the techniques used to studyDNA damage induction and repair in a specific part of the
genome are PCR based [18]. Because telomeres are constituted ofrepeated sequences, there are no unique PCR-primer sites.Mismatch primers have been developed to analyze humantelomere length by quantitative PCR [19]. However, since thoseprimers can bind to any repeat element of the telomere sequence,they cannot be used in standard techniques to study DNA damageinduction and repair, which rely on having one or two knownDNA ends. An older study used a single-enzyme modification ofthe telomere restriction fragment technique (TRF) to study UV-induced CPD in telomeres [20]. However, it is now known thatthe TRF technique does not provide information on the truelength of telomeres [21]: restriction enzymes used to cleave non-telomeric DNA ( HinfI orRsaI) give TRF lengths that depend onthe site of restriction in the pre-telomeric region. The situation isexacerbated by the fact that achieving complete digestion ofgenomic DNA using a single restriction enzyme is challenging.
Thus studying the induction of DNA damage using the TRFtechnique does not provide information exclusively abouttelomeres but about a mixture of telomeric and pre-telomericDNA. Pre-telomeric DNA is now known to be one of the mostrapidly-repaired regions of the genome [22], skewing lesionmeasurements if this region is included.We developed a novel method, based on the chromatinimmunoprecipitation technique (ChIP), to study single-strandDNA damage. This technique, ‘‘immunoprecipitation of DNAdamage’’ (IPoD), allows the separation of damaged DNA fromundamaged. The result is two fractions that can each bequantitated by PCR using primers specific for the gene understudy. Previously developed primers specific for the humantelomeric sequence [19] can be used in this technique, allowingthe study of single-strand DNA damage induction and repair inthis region. Using the IPoD technique, we have studied UV-
induced CPD induction and repair in the telomere as well as in thep53tumor suppressor gene, in 28S ribosomal DNA, and in aportion of mitochondrial DNA. We find that the telomeresequence is highly sensitive to the induction of CPD by UV light.Moreover, we show that the repair of those UV-induced CPD intelomeres is nearly absent.ResultsImmunoprecipitation of DNA Damage (IPoD) Is aQuantitative TechniqueIPoD is based on the ChIP technique [23]. Instead ofimmunoprecipitating a protein covalently cross-linked to DNA,IPoD directly immunoprecipitates DNA fragments containing aDNA structural alteration. Here we use the IPoD technique tostudy the CPD damage induced on a DNA strand by UVradiation [9]. The technique is schematized in Figure 1A. As thelevel of DNA damage in a specific region of the genome increases,the number of immunoprecipitated fragments from this region willincrease. UV-irradiated DNA, but not unirradiated DNA, yielded
an IP fraction using antibody against CPD but not with antibodyto Bcl-xL protein or with antibody omitted (Figure S1). UVC hasbeen used in this study to minimize the introduction of
an IP fraction using antibody against CPD but not with antibodyto Bcl-xL protein or with antibody omitted (Figure S1). UVC hasbeen used in this study to minimize the introduction ofphotosensitized oxidative DNA damage that accompanies UVB.The quantity of specific genomic DNA fragments present in theIP fraction was measured, after removing CPDs using photolyase,by PCR amplification using primers specific for the p53tumorsuppressor gene, the 28S ribosomal RNA repeat region, the CYTBgene of mitochondrial DNA, and telomeric DNA. The telomeresequence is composed of a 6-mer concatenated to greater than5 kb, complicating the design of PCR amplification primers. A 5 921-mer primer composed of telomeric repeats is certain to have acomplement on the 3 9primer, so primers will anneal togetherinstead of annealing to the telomeric DNA target. Cawthon [19]describes telomeric primers containing mismatches that preventprimers from annealing to each other, thus achieving preferential
annealing to telomeric DNA. Because the particular site at whichany primer binds on the telomere sequence is random, theresulting PCR product is not a sharp band but a smear.For the exponential PCR process to be used quantitatively, itmust contain an internal control, as in real-time PCR, or becarried out so that all samples have been amplified by the samefactor of 2n, that is, with all samples lying on the log-linear part ofthe amplification curve so that they can be compared to acalibration curve. No internal control is possible with IP, so weadjusted the amount of starting DNA material and the number ofPCR cycles to achieve log-linearity for each primer. Figure 1B(upper two panels) shows that the signal from the PCR amplifiedIPoD-immunoprecipitated DNA is proportional to the UVC dosefor 3 different genomic regions. Each genomic region’s signal isnormalized to that region’s signal at 20 J/m2. The signal was
2. The signal waslinear up to 30 J/m2UVC (Figure S2). Above this dose range, theslope decreased. Doses above 20 J/m2UVC are lethal so thepresent experiments did not enter that range. The high-dose slopereduction could be due to sustaining more than 1 CPD per DNAfragment, saturating the anti-CPD antibody with CPDs, ordepleting PCR reagents. Linearity at doses below 30 J/m2UVCindicates that: a) CPDs are not missed because they occur in DNAAuthor SummaryTelomeres consist of a repeated sequence located at eachend of each chromosome. This repeated sequence isrequired for chromosomal stability and integrity, afunction important for both cancer and aging. The DNAsequence of human telomeres is 5–10 kb of a repeateddouble-strand hexamer (5 9TTAGGG/5 9CCCTAA). In theory,this sequence is nearly optimal for acquiring UV-inducedDNA damage. We developed a novel technique, theimmunoprecipitation of DNA damage (IPoD), to studyDNA damage induction and repair in the telomere and in
coding regions ( p53, 28S rDNA, and mitochondrial DNA).We find that human telomeres are hypersensitive to UV-induced DNA photoproducts and that the removal ofthose DNA photoproducts is almost absent. Cells contain-ing persistent high levels of telomeric DNA damagenevertheless proliferate and chronic UV irradiation of cellsdoes not accelerate telomere shortening. Telomeres aretherefore unique in at least three respects: their biophys-ical UV sensitivity, their prevention of excision repair, andtheir tolerance of unrepaired lesions.UV Damage Induction and Repair in Human TelomeresPLoS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 2 April 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | e1000926
segments that will already be IPd due to another CPD; b) themany telomere copies do not saturate the PCR reaction; and c)CPDs or (6-4) photoproducts remaining in the fragment duringPCR do not cause a dose-dependent dropout of sample.To confirm the last point, we also amplified the IP fractionwithout first reversing remaining CPD with photolyase (Figure 1B,lower panel). When normalized to the signal at 20 J/m2, the shapeand slope of the dose-response curve were unchanged for bothsingle-copy and repeat genes. Because PCR-blockage is sometimesused as a relatively insensitive lesion assay, this might seemparadoxical. But the goal of the PCR blockage assay is todetermine whether the extent of amplification is reducedcompared to undamaged DNA, by measuring the percentage offragments that have no lesions between the PCR primers. Incontrast, IPoD has already identified the CPD-containingfragments via the IP step, so the CPDs can lie outside the PCRd
region. The IPoD amplification serves only to make visible aparticular set of CPD-containing fragments present in the IPsample. Even when some photoproducts are present, as in theabsence of photolyase, the signal is nearly normal: a) 60% of the,750 bp sheared fragment lies outside the ,300 bp PCRfragment; thus, even if photoproducts are a complete block toPCR, the PCR primers are assaying a CPD-target region external tothe PCR primers rather than internal plus external. b) Diminutionof a gene’s PCR signal due to a photoproduct internal to theprimers is equal between genes, on average, because every IPdmolecule has by definition at least one cyclobutane dimer and, atthe UV doses used, typically no more than one dimer permolecule. c) PCR inhibition is only partial because i) Taqpolymerase can slowly bypass CPDs [24] and ii) partially-extendedfragments will, in the next PCR cycle, anneal to a different partnerand extend further; thus the internal region is sampled as well.
Telomeres Are Hypersensitive to UV-Induced DNADamageTo compare the level of UV-induced CPDs in telomeres withthe level in other genomic regions, we calculated for each regionthe absolute percentage of the input that was IPd (IP/Input). Thisabsolute number circumvents differences in PCR efficiency orcopy number. The IP fraction was amplified using primers for p53,Figure 1. The ImmunoPrecipitation of DNA Damage technique (IPoD). (A) Schematic representation of the technique. Damaged or controlDNA is sonicated to 500–1,000 bp fragments, denatured, and immunoprecipitated (IPd) using a DNA lesion-specific antibody and staph A beads. (B)Linearity of the IPoD signal at minimally-lethal doses. UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) in human diploid fibroblasts were assayed a tlow UV doses in the p53 gene, the 28S ribosomal DNA gene, and the telomeres. For each sample, the integrated intensity of the band or lane
containing the PCR–amplified IP pulldown fraction is normalized against the unamplified input DNA for that sample. For comparison between doses,the pulldown percentages at 0 and 20 J/m2were assigned a value of 0% and 100%, respectively. The dose response is linear for each genome regionanalyzed and this linearity was not affected by removing CPD before PCR using photolyase. Each result depicted in (B) is derived from triplicateexperiments.doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1000926.g001UV Damage Induction and Repair in Human TelomeresPLoS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 3 April 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | e1000926
28S rDNA, and the telomere after removing CPD withphotolyase. For the corresponding Input DNA, various dilutionswere amplified and a calibration curve of PCR signal vs dilutionwas constructed. The PCR signal from the IP was compared withthe curve to determine the dilution factor matching the IP signal,and thus the ratio IP/Input.At 20 J/m2, 14% of the telomeric DNA fragments weredamaged (Figure 2), whereas approximately 2% of fragmentsfrom the p53or 28S rDNA genes were damaged at the same dose.The same ratios were obtained whether or not remaining CPDwere reversed with photolyase prior to PCR amplification (notshown). Therefore, the telomeric region is 7 times more sensitivethan two other regions of the genome. To determine whether oneof the telomeric DNA strands was responsible for this sensitivity,we examined the strands separately. Because each strand of thetelomere contains only 3 of the 4 possible nucleotides (only GATfor the 5 9TTAGGG strand and only ATC for the 5 9CCCTAA
strand), we performed a strand-specific amplification of thetelomere by omitting one nucleotide from the reaction. Inaddition, an initial linear amplification using only one of the 2primers and 3 of the 4 nucleotides was performed for 30 cycles.Linear amplification was followed by a standard PCR amplifica-tion of the linear-amplified DNA (see Materials and Methods).Each strand was more sensitive than p53or rDNA (Figure 2), with16% of the 5 9CCCTAA strand fragments being damaged at 20 J/m2UVC and 6% of the 5 9TTAGGG strand.The telomeric sensitivity was not due to a difference in thefrequency of dipyrimidine sites (the site of formation ofcyclobutane dimers). This frequency was 29.5 dipyrimidine sitesper 100 nucleotide in the p53 fragment, 28.9 in the rDNA
fragment, and 33.3 in the telomere. We also examined possibleartifactual explanations for the telomeric sensitivity. First, repeatedDNA at the ends of chromosomes might sonicate differently,producing more-readily IPd fragments. A Southern blot showedthat the sizes of sheared telomere and p53DNA are the same(Figure S3A). Second, telomeric DNA might have a conformationmore accessible to antibody or enzymes. A similar Southern blotexperiment revealed that photolyase could completely reversecyclobutane dimers in both telomeres and p53, suggesting that, atleast in naked DNA, accessibility differences do not play a role(Figure S3B). Thirdly, the large number of telomeric repeats mightcreate shorter PCR fragments, which would PCR more efficiently.But the number-average molecular weight of the telomere smear is250–500 bp, the same range as the ,300 bp p53and 28S bands.
Finally, we considered that more ‘copies’ of the (diluted) telomericrepeat are present in the PCR reaction than are p53copies, butthis is also true for its pre-IP control.Repeatedness Per Se Renders Telomeres Sensitive to UVTo confirm the UV hypersensitivity of telomeres independentlyof IPoD, and to test whether the telomere’s hypersensitivity wasdue to its DNA sequence independent of telomere-bound proteinssuch as shelterins or chromatin-induced DNA conformation, weexamined synthetic oligonucleotides. Four different double-stranded 102-mer oligonucleotides were constructed in whichthe central 60 bp were varied to include either: 10 repeats of thetelomere sequence (5 9TTAGGG/CCCTAA) (‘‘Telomere’’), 10repeats of a modified 6-mer (5 9TTCAGG/CCTGAA) having the
same number of potential UV photoproduct sites (dipyrimidinesites) (‘‘Repeats’’), or a single random sequence containing thesame number of potential UV photoproduct sites (two examples,‘‘Equi-diPyr #1’’ and ‘‘Equi-diPyr #2’’). Each 102-mer wasirradiated with either 100 or 500 J/m2UVC (0.1 – 0.5 CPD permolecule). The irradiated double strand oligonucleotides weredirectly applied onto a nylon membrane (without PCR amplifi-cation) using a dot-blot apparatus and CPD-containing DNA was
molecule). The irradiated double strand oligonucleotides weredirectly applied onto a nylon membrane (without PCR amplifi-cation) using a dot-blot apparatus and CPD-containing DNA wasdetected using a CPD-specific antibody (Figure 3). The quantifi-cation shows that the telomere repeat was 5 times more sensitive toUVC-induction of CPD than either of the non-repeatedsequences. Surprisingly, the non-telomeric 6-mer repeat (5 9TT-CAGG) was 3 times more sensitive than the random (non-repeated) sequences. This result suggests that repeatedness per serenders dipyrimidine-containing oligonucleotides more sensitive toUV, with telomeric sequences being particularly sensitive.The Telomeric Sequence Acquires UV-Sensitivity above 4RepeatsTo determine the number of repeats needed to confer sensitivityto CPD formation, we designed 102-mer double-strand oligonu-cleotides having increasing numbers of telomeric repeats (‘‘Telo’’series). As control, oligonucleotides were designed to have a
dipyrimidine-containing region of the same length as thecorresponding telomeric repeats but not arranged as repeats(‘‘Equi’’ series). Outside the repeated region or the correspondingdipyrimidine-containing region, the oligonucleotide lacks dipyr-imidine sites. For the ‘‘Equi’’ series, increasing the length of thedipyrimidine-containing region linearly increased the number ofCPDs induced, as expected (Figure 4). The Telo series behavedsimilarly to the Equi oligonucleotides up to 4 repeats. Strikingly, apositive effect of repeats on UV induction of CPD appearedaround 5 repeats, as if the DNA had undergone a phase transition.The oligonucleotide containing 5 telomere repeats was 3 timesmore sensitive than the non-repeated oligo. At 7 repeats, a plateauwas reached at which sensitivity to CPD formation was 4–5 timesgreater in the oligonucleotide containing repeats than in the non-repeated oligo. Limitations on synthesizing longer telomeric
oligonucleotides prevented us from determining whether theUV-susceptibility of repeats continues to increase with repeatnumber – with the plateau merely reflecting the fact that double-strandedness is partially lost at DNA ends – or truly plateaus dueto complete acquisition of an altered conformation.Telomeres Do Not Repair Their Cyclobutane DimersTo examine photoproduct repair, sub-confluent human diploidlung fibroblasts (WI38) were irradiated with a minimally lethaldose of UVC (10 J/m2) and harvested at different time points 0–48 hours post-irradiation. Photoproduct-containing DNA wasthen isolated using IPoD and, after photoreversing CPD, amplifiedusing primers specific for the telomere region (‘‘Telomere’’),mitochondrial DNA (‘‘mtDNA’’), the gene for the RNAcomponent of ribosomal subunit 28S (‘‘28S’’), and tumorsuppressor gene p53(‘‘p53’’). p53was used as a positive controlfor fast repair by the transcription-coupled NER system (TCNER)
[25] because p53is actively transcribed in human cells, especiallyafter a genotoxic stress such as UV irradiation. The repair rateobserved here will reflect both DNA strands and thus will be anaverage of TCNER on the transcribed strand and slower globalgenomic NER (GGNER) on the non-transcribed strand. CPDs inthe 28S gene of mammalian cells are known to be repaired only byGGNER and not by TCNER [26–28], so it serves as a positivecontrol for normal GGNER. In contrast, NER proteins are notpresent in mitochondria and CPD are not repaired in mtDNA[29–31]; thus mtDNA serves a negative control for repair andwould indicate any apparent photoproduct loss due to cell dilutionduring replication.We found that, 48 hours post-UVC, approximately 70%, 40%and 10% of CPD were removed from p53, 28S and mtDNA DNAregions, respectively (Figure 5A).

Figure 2. Hypersensitivity of telomeres relative to coding regions. The frequency of CPD is ,7 fold higher in human fibroblast telomeresthan in a fragment of the p53 gene or 28S ribosomal DNA at 20 J/m2UVC. This sensitivity also holds for each telomere strand individually and isunaffected by precise correction for the percentage of dimerizable dipyrimidines in the various sequences.

region was comparable to or less than that seen in the mtDNAnegative control, less than 10% after 48 hr, indicating that theNER system is ineffective in telomeres. To ensure that the lack ofrepair in the telomere region was not specific to the cell line used,the growth stage, or the UV dose, the experiment was repeated inconfluent (quiescent) skin fibroblasts at 20 J/m2UVC, with thesame result (Figure 5B).Telomeres Tolerate UV Photoproducts without TelomereShorteningCyclobutane pyrimidine dimers are profound blocks to DNAreplication forks in mammalian cells, triggering cell cycle arrestand DNA damage responses through the ATR pathway [32,33].Oxidative damage at telomeres interferes with maintenance of theD loop and induces telomere shortening [3,6,34]. To determinehow the elevated and persistent levels of CPD affect telomeremaintenance, we investigated UV-induced telomere shortening.Human diploid fibroblasts were chronically irradiated with
minimally-lethal doses of UVB, receiving 0 to 200 J/m2UVB 1day after each passage (approximately every 5 days). After 16passages, DNA was isolated and approximate telomere length wasmeasured using the telomere restriction fragment (TRF) technique[35]. At passage 12 (‘‘X12’’), the mean telomere length of un-irradiated cells was approximately 12 kb. At passage 28 (‘‘X28’’),the telomere length was approximately 8 kb (Figure 6), corre-sponding to the expected telomere shortening with increasingpassage level. Irradiating cells with 10 to 200 J/m2of UVB 16times did not increase the rate of telomere shortening. Therefore,a) normal telomere shortening is not accelerated by unrepairedCPD and b) unrepaired CPDs are not removed by telomereshortening. Evidently, the telomere possesses an efficient tolerancemechanism for cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers.DiscussionEvery eukaryote has telomeric DNA consisting of shortsequences repeated thousands of times at the end of each
chromosome. To these repeats has been attributed the role ofpreserving genome integrity via the stabilization of chromosomes.By ‘‘capping’’ chromosomes ends, telomeres protect them fromrecombination. A role of ‘‘longevity clock’’ has also been attributedto telomeres. Eukaryotes begin life with full-length telomeres and,at each cell division, telomeres shorten to finally reach a pointwhere the cell enters into a senescence state. In view of thesecritical roles in genomic integrity, the telomere’s own integrityshould be of paramount importance to the cell. The present resultsshow that telomeres are unique in at least three unexpectedquantification of the PCR–amplified bands or lanes. The ratio IP/input corrects for copy number.

Figure 3. Repeatedness per se sensitizes telomeres to UV. 400 ng of a 102-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide containing either 10telomere repeats (Telomere), 10 repeats of a non-telomeric sequence (5 9TTCGGG) (Repeats) or a non-repeat region containing the same number ofpyrimidine sites (Equi-diPyr #1 and Equi-diPyr #2) were irradiated with UVC (100 or 500 J/m2), applied to a dot-blot, and the CPD-containing DNAwas revealed using an anti–CPD antibody. Quantification of the dot-blot is graphically represented on the right. The various oligonucleotideconstructs were normalized to the telomeric repeat oligonucleotide: A value of 1 was assigned to the telomere CPD signal at 100 and 500 J/m2. Thesignal of the other conditions (repeat, Equi-diPyr #1 and#2) indicates the ratio between the intensity of the dot-blot at those conditions and the
signal of the other conditions (repeat, Equi-diPyr #1 and#2) indicates the ratio between the intensity of the dot-blot at those conditions and thetelomere. Because there was no dose-dependency in the signal ratio for any condition, it was then possible to average the signal ratios of 100 and500 J/m2. The telomere repeat oligo was 5-fold more sensitive to UV than either oligo containing the same number of dipyrimidine sites butrandomly distributed (non-repeated, Equi-diPyr). The oligo containing an arbitrary repeat was 3-fold more sensitive than the Equi-diPyr oligos. E achexperiment was performed in triplicate.

respects: their biophysical sensitivity, their prevention of repair,and their tolerance of unrepaired lesions.Biophysical Sensitivity of Telomeres to UV LightTelomeres were found to be 7 times more sensitive to UV-induced CPD than other DNA regions (Figure 2). This observationwas made in a cellular context, so the proteins and secondarystructure of the chromatin might be involved in this hypersensi-tivity. To distinguish these possibilities, we tested the sensitivity oftelomere sequence inserted in a 102-mer oligonucleotide. Becausethis oligonucleotide was irradiated in vitro , it was free of any cellularcontext. This oligonucleotide showed hypersensitivity comparableto the telomere DNA sequence in vivo (Figure 3). Thus the cellularcontext is not the major contributor to the UV hypersensitivity ofthe telomere. What, then, can explain it? We tested different
oligonucleotides for UV sensitivity and found that short repeats,like the telomeric sequence, render those oligonucleotides moresensitive. An oligonucleotide containing 10 66-mer repeats was,5-times more sensitive than an oligonucleotide containing thesame frequency of dipyrimidine sites but randomly distributed (notin repeats). Surprisingly, the sensitivity of the telomeric repeatunderwent a sudden transition at 5 repeats, suggestive of astructural phase change (Figure 4). This result means that theexpected sensitivity based on DNA sequence is not the entiresource of UV sensitivity. The biophysical nature of this transition,and its effect on the distribution of DNA photoproducts, willrequire biophysical investigation. G-rich single strands undergo a
variety of interactions such as Hoogsteen base pairing and G-Gstacking. These can create G quadruplexes, parallel-strandedhelixes, A- and Z-form DNA, hairpins, and local melting. Intelomeric and trinucleotide repeats, the stability of the variousstructures depends on the number of repeats [36,37]. Thebehavior in double-stranded DNA is less studied.Prevention of RepairA region of the genome so critical to cell survival and genomicintegrity would be expected to preserves its own integrity after agenotoxic stress. Yet little is known about how telomeric DNAdoes this. The finding that telomeres are hypersensitive to UV-induced DNA damage prompted the expectation that repair ofFigure 4. The telomeric sequence acquires UV sensitivity above 4 repeats. To determine the influence of repeat length on UV sensitivity,increasing numbers of telomeric repeats (double-stranded 6-mer, 5 9TTAGGG3 9and its complement) were embedded in 102-mer double-strand
oligonucleotides that contained no dipyrimidines outside the telomeric region. This series will exhibit a trivial increase in the UV response simpl ybecause the number of potential CPD target sites at dipyrimidines increases. This increase is linear with repeat number and is shown as the‘‘Expected’’ line (red). Each member of the ‘‘Equi’’ series of oligos contains the same number of dipyrimidine sites as the corresponding telomericoligo but randomly distributed. These Equi oligos had the expected behavior (blue line). The ‘‘Telo’’ oligo series contain 2–10 telomeric repeats (1 2–60 bp diPyr region, green line). A phase transition in UV sensitivity is visible between 4 and 7 telomere repeats. The Equi and Telo oligos arecompared by normalizing to their response at the shortest diPyr region length, the 12-mer. Each experiment used 400 ng of oligos irradiated at250 J/m
2UVC, about 0.5 CPD per oligo, and was performed in triplicate.

this DNA damage would be rapid, to prevent DNA damageaccumulation in this region. What we found was the contrary.Repair was almost absent in telomere regions, proceeding asslowly as in mitochondrial DNA where NER proteins are absent(Figure 5). Two days after UV irradiation, CPD were still presentin telomeres but had been half removed from coding regions ( p53or 28S genes) and probably entirely removed from the transcribedp53strand. The repair defect could be active or passive. In thepassive category, compaction of telomeric heterochromatin mayprevent access of repair proteins [38]. Also, telomeric DNA hasbeen reported to have partial A-DNA character [39], whichpredisposes to trans- rather than cis-isomers of CPD [8]. Little isknown about the repair of trans-isomers of CPD and they may bemore difficult for the NER system to recognize or remove. In theactive category, some of the many protein factors bound to
telomeres (reviewed in [40]) may inhibit the repair system in thisregion.There are two reasons suppression of excision repair can bedesirable. The high frequency of CPDs in the telomere, together withthe telomere’s repeat nature, may generate multiply damaged sites(MDS). MDS are sites where DNA lesions are closer than ,20 bpon opposite strands [41]. After the incision nicking that is the firststep in excision repair, multiply dam aged sites result in double-strandDNA breaks. This has been observed for UV-irradiated DNAcontaining halogenated nucleotide analogs in close proximity [41].Double-strand breaks, in turn, are clastogenic and lethal events. Atan MDS, displacement of the lesion-containing oligonucleotidesduring the second step of excision r epair will also create overlapping
daughter strand gaps [13–15]. This event increases the permissibledistance between CPDs. In unique-sequence DNA, such MDSswould be rare, but in repeats they could be the rule whenphotoproduct frequency is high. The absence of telomere shorteningafter chronic UV irradiation (Figure 6) indicates that, in fact, suchdouble-strand breaks have been avoided.Tolerance of Unrepaired LesionsThe fact that cell proliferation was unhindered by chronic UVirradiation, despite the presence of CPD in their telomeres, raises anew question: how can a cell tolerate DNA damage in itstelomeres? During mammalian DNA replication, a bulky lesionsuch as a CPD typically blocks replication fork progression[42,43]. This blockage leads to single-stranded DNA that activatesATR-dependent stress responses such as G2/M arrest andapoptosis [44]. To avoid these events at unrepaired CPDs, thereplication mechanism uses DNA polymerases capable ofbypassing CPD. In E. coli , the SOS response activates polV to a
translesion synthesis polymerase by transferring RecA-ATP to itfrom a RecA filament [45]. In human cells, the XPV gene(defective in the xeroderma pigmentosum variant complementa-tion group) codes for pol eta, a polymerase able to bypass CPD byincorporating A opposite a T or C in a CPD (reviewed in [46]).Correspondingly, cells from a squamous cell carcinoma from anXPV patient were found to generate recurrent chromosomeabnormalities as they were passaged in vitro . These were dicentricchromosomes, particularly telomere–telomere bridges, indicativeof telomeric damage [16]. It seems likely, then, that CPDaccumulating in the telomere are especially reliant on bypass toavoid replication gaps. In the absence of bypass, these replicationgaps would be frequent enough to trigger telomeric double-strandbreaks and telomere–telomere bridges, the same kinds of geneticcatastrophes that repair suppression aims to avoid.Materials and MethodsCells and UV Irradiation

Materials and MethodsCells and UV IrradiationEach experiment was performed with two different primaryhuman fibroblast cell strains. The first strain was derived frombreast reduction tissue from a healthy 25-year old female [47].The other strain was the commercially available WI38, derivedfrom lung tissue of a male foetus (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Cellswere grown in high-glucose DMEM (Gibco Invitrogen) supple-mented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells wereUV-irradiated at room temperature after replacing the mediumwith cold sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The two cellstrains have different UVC sensitivities (Figure S4). The UVCsource was a germicidal lamp emitting at 254 nm. Using UVCrather than UVB avoids potential complications from photosen-
sitized oxygen radical formation. For the telomere shorteningexperiment, UVB was used to maximize the likehood of telomereshortening; the source consisted of three fluorescent tubes(FS20T12/UVB/BP, Philips) filtered through a sheet of celluloseacetate to eliminate wavelengths below 290 nm (Kodacel TA-407clear, 0.015 inch thickness; Eastman-Kodak Co.). Dose rate wasmeasured prior to each experiment using a UVX UV-meter (UVProducts, Upland, CA).IPoDPurification of the DNA was performed using DNeasy TissueKit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer’sprotocol. Purified DNA was sonicated to 500–1000 bp fragments(Branson sonifier 250, microtip, at 30% power, 3 615 sec on ice),precipitated with NaCl/ethanol, and resuspended in resuspensionbuffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X 100, 1.2 mM EDTA,16.7 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.1, 167 mM NaCl). DNA was denaturedby boiling 10 min, incubated with the CPD-specific antibody(D194-1, MBL, Woburn, MA) [48] overnight at 4 uC and then
with a rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 hour. The anti-CPD antibody was used in molar excess to CPD to ensure thateach damaged dipyrimidine was pulled down regardless of its localsequence or slight variations in the binding affinity of the antibodyto each dipyrimidine type. Molar excess is indicated by thelinearity of the dose-response with respect to substrate (Figure 1B).Antibody-bound DNA was pulled down using Staph A beads(Calbiochem). The bead/DNA complexes were washed 2 timeswith wash buffer 1 (2 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0) and 4times with wash buffer 2 (100 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 500 mM LiCl,1% NP40, 1% deoxycholic acid). DNA was eluted from the staphA beads with elution buffer (50 mM NaHCO3, 1% SDS) and theFigure 5. Absence of excision repair of CPDs in telomeres. (A) WI38 human diploid fibroblasts were irradiated with minimally-lethal doses of
UVC (10 J/m2) and returned to the incubator for varying lengths of time before harvesting (0–48 h). The DNA was then isolated, the IPoD techniquewas used to isolate damaged DNA, photolyase was used to remove CPD, and PCR was performed on region of interest: Telomere, mitochondrial CYTBgene (mtDNA), 28S ribosomal DNA, or p53. For each time point, the integrated intensity of the band or lane containing the PCR–amplified IPpulldown fraction is normalized against the unamplified input DNA for that time point. The amount of DNA in the fraction pulled down by antibodyto CPD decreases with time in the p53 and 28S genes, reflecting normal excision repair, but not in telomeres or mtDNA ( CYTB gene). (B) A similarexperiment was performed in primary human skin fibroblasts UV-irradiated at 20 J/m2. In this experiment, CPD were removed from IPoD-
immunoprecipitated CPD containing DNA using DNA photolyase before PCR amplification and repair in the two telomeric DNA strands was analyzedtogether and separately. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. P values are derived from the two-tailed heteroscadastic Student’s t-test.doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1000926.g005UV Damage Induction and Repair in Human TelomeresPLoS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 9 April 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | e1000926
eluted DNA was cleaned using a Qiagen PCR purification kit toremove salts and SDS prior to PCR.In the indicated experiments, CPD were removed before thePCR reaction (but after the IP step) using cloned E. coli CPDphotolyase (kindly provided by Drs. C. Selby and A. Sancar). TheCPD photoreactivation mix (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 10 mMNaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM DTT, 0.2 mg/mL BSA, 0.1 mLCPD photolyase) was added to the DNA and exposed for 1 h toUVA light from eight F20T12BL lamps (Spectra Mini, DaavlinCo., Bryan, OH) passed through filters to remove UVB and UVC.The DNA was then cleaned using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen).For PCR reactions, 20 cycles of amplification were performedon a Biometra TGradient thermal cycler with Taq polymerase in10 mM Tris/HCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2, 50 mM KCl, pH 8.3 andFigure 6. UV does not induce telomere shortening in replicating cells. Human diploid fibroblasts were irradiated between each passage (for
16 passages) with the indicated doses of UVB (0–200 J/m2). UVB induces ,100 fold fewer CPDs per unit dose than UVC. After irradiating cells for 16passages (to passage 28), DNA was harvested and the telomere restriction fragment (TRF) technique was used to determine telomere length.Digoxigenin-labeled marker (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) was used. Upper panel, agarose gel; lower panel, graph of bandintensity at each size position. At passage 12, mean telomere length was ,12 kb. At passage 28, the telomere length was ,8 kb, independent of theUV dose used, corresponding to the expected telomere shortening with increasing passage level.doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1000926.g006UV Damage Induction and Repair in Human TelomeresPLoS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 10 April 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | e1000926
200mM each dNTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapo-lis, IN). A test run of PCR using different amounts of startingmaterial was done on each sample and on each primer set toensure the amplification lay in the exponential portion of theamplification reaction. The following primers were used: For thetelomere sequence: 5 9GGTTTTT GAGGGT GAGGGT GAGG-GTGAGGGT GAGGGT and 5 9TCCCGACTA TCCCTA TCC-CTA TCCCTA TCCCTA TCCCTA [19]. The underlined basesare mismatched with respect to the telomere sequence. For the p53gene: 5 9CTGCCTCTTGCTTCTCTTTTCC and 5 9GGTTTC-TTCTTTGGCTGGG, giving a PCR product of 309 bp. For 28Sribosomal DNA: 5 9GTAGAATAAGTGGGAGGCCCCCGGand 5 9AGGCCCCGCTTTCACGGTCTGTATTCG, giving aPCR product of 368 bp. For the CYTB gene in mitochondrialDNA: 5 9CCCTAGCCAACCCCTTAAAC and 5 9TTGGCT-TAGTGGGCGAAATA, giving a PCR product of 297 bp. Theagarose gel was scanned and quantification was done usingImageQuant 5.0 software (Molecular Dynamics). For p53, 28S and
mtDNA, the band was simply quantified and the background wassubtracted from the signal. For the telomere sequence, the PCRprimers can anneal varying distances apart on the telomericrepeat, so the PCR product is not a single-size product but ratheran assortment of DNA fragments over a size range. We thereforeran telomeric samples on the agarose gel for a few minutes (to letthe DNA enter the gel and to separate the PCR product from theprimers), making the smear band-like. The entire smear wasquantified using the same technique as for coding regions.DNA Damage ImmunoblotOligonucleotides used in dot-blot experiments are depicted inTable 1. 400 ng of each double-strand oligo was irradiated withthe indicated UVC doses using a 254 nm source. The irradiatedDNA was denatured and applied onto a nitrocellulosemembrane using a dot-blot appa ratus. CPD-containing DNAon the membrane was visualized u sing a CPD-specific antibody
(D194-1, MBL, Woburn, MA) [48] followed by a secondaryanti-mouse-HRP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SantaCruz CA) and revealed by chem iluminescence (Denville,M e t u c h e n ,N J ) .D i f f e r e n tf i l m exposures were scanned andquantification was done using ImageQuant 5.0 software(Molecular Dynamics).Telomere Shortening ExperimentCells were irradiated with different UVB doses (0, 10, 50, 100and 200 J/m2). After the irradiation, cells from each condition
were allow to grow until they reached full confluency. When cellsfrom every exposure condition reached 100% confluency, theywere all passaged 1:4. This precaution was taken to assure thatUV-irradiated cells did not undergo fewer population doublingsthan unirradiated ones at the same passage number. (Adisadvantage of this design is that mortality at the higher UVdoses would cause more divisions of the remaining living cells tocompensate, possibly leading to faster telomere shortening at thesedoses. However, because telomere shortening was not seen, thisabsence is conclusive.) UV-induced telomere shortening would beobscured if UV also reduced the number of cell doublings bydecreasing the cell density at confluence. This effect would reducethe extent of normal, replication-related, telomere shortening. Thecell density reduction apparently did not occur here. Because eachcell lineage was split at the same ratio, a 25% reduction in celldensity of treated cells compared to untreated would
of treated cells compared to untreated would result ina (0.75)

(from X12 to X28). But no difference in the final amount of DNAharvested was observed between any of the UV doses.Terminal restriction fragment length measurements wereobtained using the Telo TTAGGG telomere length assay kit(Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) as donepreviously [47]. Briefly, 2 mg of HinfI/RsaI-digested genomicDNA were separated on 0.8% agarose gels and Southern blottedonto a Hybond-N +nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences,
Piscataway, NJ). After UV-fixation of DNA fragments onto themembrane, membranes were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeledtelomere-specific probe (TTAGGG)4. After washing out non-bound probe, membranes were incubated with a digoxigenin-specific antibody covalently coupled to alkaline phosphatase.Finally, the telomere fragments were visualized by a chemilumi-nescent substrate (CDP-star, Roche Molecular Biochemicals,Indianapolis, IN). TRF lengths were determined by comparingthe signals relative to a standard molecular weight usingImageQuant 5.0 software (Molecular Dynamics). All lanes weredivided into 75 intervals, and the mean TRF length was defined asS(ODi)/S(ODi/Li), in which ODi is the chemiluminescent signaland Li is the length of the TRF fragment at position I [49].Although TRF fragments have one terminus in the pre-telomericregion, changes in TRF length reflect changes in telomere length.Supporting InformationFigure S1 Specificity of IPoD for UV-induced cyclobutane

(A) Fragmentation bysonication for telomeric DNA repeats is the same as for a coding
region. Total genomic DNA was sonicated to obtain fragmentssize between 0.5 and 1 kb. DNA was separated on a native agarosegel and transfered onto a nylon membrane by capillary action.Digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe specific for the telomeresequence or p53was then hybridized to the membrane and anti-digoxigenin coupled to alkaline phosphatase was used to revealsequence specific signal. This figure shows that the sonicationefficiency is not influenced by the repeat nature of the telomeresequence. (B) Accessibility to enzymes is similar in the telomericregion and a coding region.
