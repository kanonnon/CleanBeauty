Oral supplements that reduce sunburn may be advanta-
geous. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of Bend Skincare Anti- Aging Formula to ameliorate sunburn induced with a solar simulator.Methods : Subjects (n = 28) with Fitzpatrick skin phototypes I, II, or III took 4 capsules daily of the supplement providing 1400 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + doco-sahexaenoic acid (DHA), 120 mg of gamma- linolenic acid (GLA), 5 mg of lutein, 2.5 mg of zeaxanthin, and 1000 IU of vitamin D3 for 8 weeks. Skin on each subject’s back was exposed to a progressive sequence of timed ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure doses at baseline, and after 4-  and 8- week treatment to determine their minimal erythema dose (MED). Results were compared before and after treatment using 3 paired t tests and subsequently 3 linear mixed models.Results: Treatment significantly improved tolerance to UV exposure as evidenced by increased MED at 4 and 8 weeks compared with baseline (P  < .001). This pro-
tection increased with prolonged use of Bend Skincare Anti- Aging Formula as dem-onstrated by progressively increased MED between baseline and 4 weeks, and again between 4 and 8 weeks (P  < .001). Nearly 86% of patients responded to treatment within 4 weeks and 100% of patients responded by the end of the study, resulting in a 39% mean increase in MED at 4 weeks, and an 84% mean increase in MED at 8 weeks compared with baseline. Treatment was well tolerated with no product associated adverse events (AE) and only a few mild and expected side effects.Conclusion : Bend Skincare Anti- Aging Formula safely and effectively provides signifi-cant skin photoprotection that increases with continued use.KEYWORDScarotenoids, fish oil, skin, sunburn, UV radiationThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium,

In Canada, in 2004, the cost for treatment of melanoma alone was $444 million, and for nonmela-noma was $88 million, and is expected to rise by 2031 to $696 million and $226 million, respectively.2 A study including beach goers in the United States (US) found that sunburn accounts for up to 92 720 lost workdays annually, making the economic burden for lost work plus treatment in excess of $10 million annually.3Erythema (skin redness) is an acute inflammatory skin response resulting from UV radiation overexposure. Both UVA (320- 400 nm) and UVB (280- 320 nm) contribute to this response known as sunburn, although UVB (280- 320 nm) is more potent in this regard.4 Sunburn
response varies widely among individuals depending on skin type (ie people with lighter skin tone have a greater sunburn risk) and within the same person depending on factors such as age5 and diet.6,7In experimental models, sunburn sensitivity is measured using the minimal erythema dose (MED), defined as the smallest UV dose producing perceptible skin redness within distinct borders in a given period of time after exposure.8-10 The higher the MED, the more re-sistant the skin is to sunburn. Therefore, increased MED following an experimental treatment signifies photoprotection.Experimental sunburn is achieved using solar stimulators providing a continuous spectral output in the UVB (290- 320 nm), UVAII (320- 340 nm) and UVAI (340- 400 nm) ranges that are similar to sunlight. Instrument performance, calibration, and operation requirements are defined within the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Federal Register8 and are necessary to achieve reliable test results.
In recent years, interest in using natural products including nutri -ents as photoprotectors has grown.11-13 Orally administered nutrients showing benefit include omega- 3 fatty acids derived from fish14-18 and a variety of antioxidants,13 while vitamin D exhibits anti- inflammatory effects19 in vitro20-22 and in vivo,23 and reduces polymorphic light eruption when topically applied to human skin.24 In addition, oral omega- 6 fatty acids, frequently sourced from borage oil, are now rec -ognized contributors to inflammation resolution,25 and so may be valu-able additions to products aimed at preventing/relieving inflammatory skin conditions like sunburn. To date, no clinical studies have reported the combined effects of these nutrients on lowering sunburn risk.The primary objective of this pilot trial was to evaluate and com-pare changes in the MED following use of an oral supplement combin-ing benefits of omega- 6 and omega- 3 fatty acids with the antioxidants
zeaxanthin and lutein, and vitamin D. The secondary trial purpose was to assess the safety of the supplement under the conditions of use.2 |  METHODSThis open- label clinical trial, completed within a contract testing labo-ratory, included recruitment of at least 30 subjects from the general population in New Jersey, United States, aged 19- 65 years, who met all of the following inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.2.1 | Inclusion criteriaSubjects with a Fitzpatrick skin phototype I, II, or III (Table 1), aged 19- 65 years, inclusive, who were considered suitable by a nurse or physician prior to their trial initiation; those who had protected the test site from sun for 4 weeks prior to trial initiation, had completed a medical history form, had understood and executed an informed consent form, and who were considered dependable and capable of understanding and following directions.2.2 | Exclusion criteria

2.3 | InterventionParticipants were instructed to consume 4 Bend Skincare Anti- Aging Formula soft gelatin capsules supplied by Bend Beauty Inc., Halifax, N.S. Canada, once daily for 8 weeks. The total daily dose contained 1400 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) derived from fish oil, 120 mg of GLA derived from borage oil, 5 mg of lutein derived from marigold flower oleoresin, 2.5 mg of zeaxanthin derived from Capsicum annuum (paprika) fruit, and 1000 IU of vitamin D3. Subjects were required to record the time of supplement use in a daily diary to monitor compliance, as well as comments on the product’s attributes. Capsule counts were main-tained before and after treatment to determine the percentage of TABLE 1 Characteristics of Fitzpatrick skin phototypes I, II, and IIISkin type Sunburn and tanning historyI Always burns easily; never tansII Always burns easily; tans minimallyIII Burns moderately; tans gradually

There were no changes to the trial’s primary outcome after the trial commenced. The secondary outcome was a progressive positive percentage change in MED from baseline to after 4-  and 8- week treatment. Unsolicited patient- reported outcomes were recorded in the daily diaries.2.5 | Determination of MEDThe MED of each subject was determined within the first 7 days of the initial time point (when supplementation began), and again at 4 and 8 weeks following supplementation, using instrumentation speci -fications, qualifications, and calibrations as well as MED assessment scoring requirements defined by the US FDA.8 Subjects were seated
8 Subjects were seated upright during the UV irradiation and MED assessments. During irra-diation, unprotected skin on each subject’s back was exposed to full- spectrum UV radiation with a continuous spectral output similar to sunlight (UVB range 290 nm- 320 nm, UVAII range 320 nm- 340 nm, and UVAI range 340- 400 nm) using a solar simulator (Solar Light Company, Philadelphia, PA, USA).At baseline, different sections of each subject’s back were exposed to a progressive sequence of timed UV radiation exposures, each of which was graduated incrementally by 25% over the previous expo-sure. The initial dose of radiation varied according to their Fitzpatrick skin phototype (eg those with Type I received a lower dose than Type III) such that different subjects were exposed to different dosage sequences.A trained grader evaluated the skin test sites for erythema be-tween 16 and 24 hours after irradiation using the MED Scoring
Scale described in Table 2. The MED was defined as the quantity of erythema- effective energy (mJ/cm2) that produced mild but definite erythema within clearly defined borders (ie “1” on the MED Scoring Scale). If a baseline MED could not be determined by the grader during the first irradiation sequence, as second irradiation occurred. Subjects were removed from the study if the second irradiation sequence did not yield a baseline MED.After 4 weeks of supplementation, the MED was determined again as previously described on a skin test site in close proximity to the baseline MED skin test site. However, this time the starting dose of UV radiation was adjusted such that the baseline MED became the midpoint irradiation dose within the sequence of 25% incremental doses applied. If the MED could not be determined after the first ir -
radiation sequence, a second sequence was conducted. If the MED could not be determined with the second irradiation sequence, the subject was allowed to remain in the study, but they were not included in the statistical analysis. Similarly, subjects returned to the test facil-ity after 8 weeks of supplementation. This time the MED was deter -mined using an irradiation sequence in which the week 4 MED was the midpoint. Evaluation of the irradiated test site was conducted as described for the baseline and week 4 time points.Throughout the study, subjects were required to maintain a daily diary of test material use and to record comments pertaining to their experiences with the test material.2.6 | Sample size
Throughout the study, subjects were required to maintain a daily diary of test material use and to record comments pertaining to their experiences with the test material.2.6 | Sample size
2.6 | Sample sizeSubjects could freely withdraw from the trial at any time and for any reason, in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (as amended). The PI could also withdraw subjects from the trial for safety, lack of efficacy, or administrative reasons. Possible reasons may have included experiencing a serious or intolerable ad-verse events (AE); development during the course of the trial, of any symptoms or conditions listed in the exclusion criteria, including preg-nancy; consumption of contraindicated medications; a protocol viola-tion such as failure to comply with the specified treatment regimen or failure to comply with the visit schedule; a request by the subject to discontinue due to a clinical event for which the PI did not con-sider removal from the trial to be necessary or any other nonspecific, subject- initiated reason.2.7 | Statistical methodsPer- protocol analysis was performed using 3 paired t tests to deter-
mine if any statistically significant differences in MED occurred be-tween baseline and week 4, between baseline and week 8 and between weeks 4 and 8. Results were deemed statistically significantly differ -ent if P < .05. However, the paired t test does not take into account any random effects, and the P- values are not adjusted for repeated testing. Therefore, to confirm the validity of conclusions based on the paired t test analysis, 3 subsequent linear mixed models were built and analyzed in R using ANOVA to generate P- values for comparing those models. A linear mixed model explicitly considers both random- effect and fixed- effect covariates and therefore is advantageous when both effects are present, as in our data. The random variation in baseline MED was modeled where Subjects  were considered as random- effect covariates, while the Weeks  and Skin Types  were considered as fixed
effects and successively added in the following 3 models: Group 0—MED ~ (1|Subject); Group 1—MED ~ Week + (1|Subject); Group 2—MED ~ Week + Skin + (1|Subject).TABLE 2 Minimal erythema dose scoring scaleScore Description0 No reaction0.5 Equivocal reaction, barely perceptible erythema with no clearly defined border1 Mild but definite erythema with clearly defined borders2 Moderate clearly defined erythema3 Strong erythema, edema4 Bulla or vesiculation 16000781, 2018, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phpp.12350 by Keio University, Wiley Online Library on [26/09/2024].

|  155MORSE Et al.2.8 | Adverse EventsEach subject was monitored for the signs and symptoms of AEs during each examination by the trial personnel and through spontaneous re-ports from the subjects. These included AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concomitant medications or progressive disease states. All AEs whether volunteered, elicited or noted during each visit were recorded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.4. All AEs were evaluated by the PI for their relationship to, or asso-ciation with the test material (or other causes) and for their intensity. Any actions taken (eg discontinuation of test material, administration of treatment, etc.) and the resulting outcome of the AE were recorded. Subjects who withdrew from the trial due to an AE were followed until the outcome of the event was determined, and a written summary of the event and follow- up was maintained. The Allendale Institutional
Review Board (an independent group of professionals utilized by the contract testing laboratory, as required by FDA federal regulations) was informed of any serious AEs as instructed in the study protocol.2.9 | Ethics ApprovalThe study was conducted in accordance with the current Declaration of Helsinki, with the ICH Guideline E6 Good Clinical Practices, the requirements of the FDA 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, and with stand-ard operating procedures of the contract testing laboratory. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject enrolled in the study. The protocol, informed consent form, and relevant procedures were approved by the Allendale Investigational Review Board on 6 February 2014. Trial registration was not applicable under FDAAA801 requirements.3 |  RESULTSThis study, conducted between 14 April 2014 and 18 June 2014, ended after the last follow- up visit by the last patient was completed for the week 8 assessment. There were no amendments to the proto -
col after trial commencement. However, there were a number of devi-ations, none of which had any significant impact on the trial results, as follows: The baseline MEDs for 3 subjects were not evaluated within 16- 24 hours after irradiation because the subjects failed to return to the testing facility in a timely fashion such that their evaluations took place 1, 24, and 110 minutes beyond the allowed 24 hour upper time limit; however, a MED was obtained for each subject; 2 subjects did not record taking the test material within the daily diary on 1 day; one subject took 2 capsules on Day 0 instead of 4 capsules; One subject, on 4 occasions, took 2 capsules per day instead of 4 capsules; at week 4, one subject said they recorded when the test material was taken, even though they forgot to take it on a few of those days; and the week 8 MEDs for 2 subjects were not evaluated 16- 24 hours after irradiation.Thirty- three subjects were enrolled and 28 completed the study.
The reasons for subject drop out/withdrawal were as follows: Two did not meet the inclusion criteria, one withdrew consent, one was dis-qualified due to excessive sun exposure in the test area and one took exclusionary medication. The demographics for the subjects included in the study at baseline are presented in Table 3. The subject’s ages ranged from 21 to 64 years (mean 47.4 ± 11.5); 5 subjects had Skin Type I (17.9%), 15 subjects had Skin Type II (53.6%), and 8 subjects had Skin Type III (28.6%); and their baseline MEDs ranged from 12.0 to 49.3 mJ/cm2 (mean 23.5 ± 9.7).Supplement intake compliance was approximately 96% through-out the study.3.1 | OutcomesResults for the paired t tests are presented in Table 3. The amount of energy needed to produce the MED significantly increased (P < .001) compared with baseline after 4 and 8 weeks of supplementation. The mean MED at baseline was 23.5 mJ/cm2, and increased to 33.9 and
2, and increased to 33.9 and 43.8 mJ/cm2 after 4 and 8 weeks of supplementation, respectively.
mean MED at baseline was 23.5 mJ/cm2, and increased to 33.9 and 43.8 mJ/cm2 after 4 and 8 weeks of supplementation, respectively. There was also a significant increase in energy required to achieve a MED between 4 and 8 weeks (P < .001). These results corresponded to a mean increase of 39% in MED at 4 weeks and an 84% mean in-crease in MED at 8 weeks, compared with baseline (Table 3, Figure 1). In addition, these increases were observed throughout the test pop -ulation with 85.7% and 100% of the subjects requiring an increase in energy to produce a MED at week 4 and week 8, respectively (Figure 2).Results of the linear mixed models analyzes confirmed our conclusion based on the paired t  test and showed that the MED significantly increased after treatment (Table 3). Adding the Week  covariate had a significant effect on the MED (P  < .001), adding both the Week  and the Skin Type covariates had a significant effect
on the MED (P  < .001), and adding the Skin Type covariate had a weaker but still significant effect on the MED (P  < .001). Combined, these results confirm that the MED does increase significantly due to treatment effects.A few patients reported outcomes within their daily diaries (Table 4) including 5 mild side effects and 5 perceived enhanced skin, hair, or overall health effects.No serious AEs related to the supplement were reported by the subjects or noted by the trial monitors. There were 2 AEs unrelated to supplement use as follow: One subject developed a cough and took a cough medicine on 1 day and another subject rolled her ankle. The latter subsequently consumed anti- inflammatory medication that pre-vented continuation within the trial.4 |  DISCUSSION

This study showed that oral supplementation with Bend Skincare Anti- Aging Formula safely and effectively reduced the likelihood and/or severity of the inflamma-tory response associated with sunburn within a given UV exposure time and dose. It is the first study to report the combined efficacy and safety of oral supplementation with omega- 6 and omega- 3 fatty acids, zeaxanthin, lutein, and vitamin D to provide such photoprotection.To the author’s knowledge, no human intervention studies have investigated the protective effects of GLA against UV damage in skin. However, GLA has proven anti- inflammatory effects in skin as evidenced in atopic eczema trials,26-28 possibly due to its metabolic conversion to anti- inflammatory PGE129 and lipoxin,30 a specialized proresolving mediator derived from arachidonic acid (AA) that acti -
vates inflammation resolution.25 Hence, GLA may lessen sunburn as-sociated inflammation.The fish oil derived omega- 3s, EPA, and DHA, inhibit IL- 8 produc -tion that may partly account for their anti- inflammatory effects yielding UV- protection in skin.31 In human epidemiological studies, omega- 3 intake is associated with reduced UVB- erythemal sensitivity and pho-toaging.32 Omega- 3s also alter the skin EPA:AA ratio, which during the acute stage of inflammation, reduces pro- inflammatory prostaglandin and leukotriene production14 thereby reducing blood vessel dilation,16 under basal as well as inflammatory insult conditions.14Numerous randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled,14,17,18 and open trials15,16 have reported significantly increased UV- induced sunburn threshold (a defined dose causing perceptible erythema similar to a MED) following 1800 mg—5 g/d EPA alone 14,17 or with 1200 mg/d DHA 15,16,18 for as little as 4 weeks.18 In addition, sunburn
threshold rose progressively throughout treatment, but fell 10 weeks after treatment cessation, indicating that constant supplementation is needed for continuous protection.15 This enhanced efficacy with pro-longed use is consistent with the results obtained in our study, even though our dosage of total omega- 3s was slightly less (ie 1400 mg EPA + DHA daily).The current United States daily dietary intake of EPA  + DHA is only 40 mg in children and teens, and 90 mg in adults.33 And even though 7.8% of adults and 1.1% of children use EPA/DHA supple-ments,34,35 they only contribute additionally, about 10 mg of DHA and 20 mg of EPA to adult intakes.36 Canadian children only eat 92.5 mg EPA + DHA daily,37 while Canadian adults eat only 47- 160 mg of DHA per day.38-41 These deficient intakes are despite recommenda-
tions beyond that for general populations, by dozens of government departments, international bodies, and formal and informal scientific societies and groups, for both general and specific populations.42 This intake data, combined with the significant efficacy of omega- 3s against UV skin damage, lead one to speculate that nearly the en-tire North American population could benefit from photoprotection through omega- 3 supplementation.UV radiation promotes skin cancer development through muta -tions, immunosuppression, and inducing oxidative stress.6 Carotenoids are important components of the antioxidant network and help protect light-  exposed tissue.43,44 Zeaxanthin and lutein are 2 such carotenoids that work by scavenging singlet oxygen molecules and quenching free radicals responsible for oxidative tissue damage.45 They cannot be de novo synthesized and therefore must be diet derived.46 Zeaxanthin is
not only an effective antioxidant in vivo, it also reduces hydroperoxide formation in dietary oils, making it an attractive ingredient to reduce oxidative degradation within fatty acid supplements.45The antioxidant capability of zeaxanthin has been compared to
45The antioxidant capability of zeaxanthin has been compared to that of the highly potent synthetic antioxidant, Trolox. In one study, testing 3 different zeaxanthin isomers, 2 had greater free radical scav-enging capacity, and prevented oxidation better than Trolox, while one isomer was less effective.47 In a second study, zeaxanthin was reportedly more effective than Trolox.48 A 12 week multicentered, randomized, placebo- controlled trial supplementing, forty women with signs and symptoms of premature skin aging, with 0.6 mg of zea-xanthin and 10 mg of lutein daily, reported a significant increase in skin lipids, skin hydration, skin elasticity, and sunburn threshold (all P < .05).46Lutein modulates skin’s response to UV radiation, thereby con-
tributing to defense against some of sunlight’s deleterious effects. A preclinical study found that oral lutein supplementation caused lutein accumulation in the skin while decreasing reactive oxygen species generation following UVB exposure. In addition, tissue swelling and contact hypersensitivity typically induced by UVB exposure were sig-nificantly reduced.6US public health authorities recommend that men, women, and children reduce sunlight exposure to prevent skin cancer. However, increasing numbers of Americans suffer from vitamin D deficiencies and serious health problems caused by insufficient sun exposure nec -essary for endogenous vitamin D synthesis. In addition, sunscreens reduce vitamin D production, prompting recommendations to warn about vitamin D deficiency associated with their use.49 For these rea-
49 For these rea-sons alone, vitamin D is considered an important nutrient for inclusion in dietary supplements aimed at photoprotection. However, vitamin D also exhibits anti- inflammatory effects.19 In vitro studies have shown that vitamin D reduces UV- induced damage, including inflammation, FIGURE 1 Mean percent change in minimal erythema dose (MED) compared with baseline after supplementation for 4 and 8 wk 16000781, 2018, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phpp.12350 by Keio University, Wiley Online Library on [26/09/2024].

GLA, vi-tamin D, zeaxanthin, and lutein have not been tested singly in human interventions trials for their protective effects against UV damage in skin. Only one study has reported the combined effects of zeaxanthin and lutein on MED, but the data were included as a graph that did not enable calculation of an accurate numerical change in MED from baseline.46 Methodological variations within the Omega- 3–related tri-als14-18 including varying dosages of EPA and/or DHA, treatment du-
rations, and methods of assessing treatment effects, make it difficult to draw any firm conclusions. Rhodes et al17 reported a UVR- induced erythemal threshold rising from a mean of 36 mJ/cm2 at baseline to 49 mJ/cm2 (1.36- fold increase) after supplementation with 4 g daily of purified EPA for 3 months, a MED of UVB irradiation increasing from 19.8 mJ/cm2 at baseline to 33.8 mJ/cm2 (1.7-fold increase) fol-lowing 3 months treatment,16 and from 18.9 mJ/cm2 at baseline to 41.1 mJ/cm2 (2.17- fold increase) following 6 months treatment 15 with 1800 mg EPA  + 1200 mg DHA daily. Orengo et al18 reported a MED of approximately 13.25 mJ/cm2 at baseline that increased to roughly 15.5 mJ/cm2 (1.2- fold increase) following 4 weeks treatment with 2800 mg EPA and 1200 mg DHA daily. Our study provided less active (1400 mg of EPA  + DHA) than any of those studies. It also had a shorter treatment duration (8 weeks) than 3 of 4 of those studies.
However, it achieved a greater (1.8- fold) increase in MED than 3 of 4 of those studies. Whether or not this enhanced efficacy measured in our study, was due to individual potency or synergistic effects of ingre-dients other than the omega- 3s within the Bend Skincare Anti- Aging Formula, is difficult to know.The safety of Bend Skincare Anti- Aging Formula was demonstrated by the lack of product associated AEs and the limited number of only mild side effects in the patient- reported outcomes. All of the mild gas-trointestinal side effects (excluding possible dry skin) are consistent with typical side effects reported for other fish oil50 and borage oil51 FIGURE 2 Percentage change in energy to produce a minimal erythema dose (MED) relative to baseline, within each subject, following treatment for 4 and 8 wk

None of these side effects, or cautions, warning, contraindication or known adverse reactions, are required to be declared on product la-bels by the Canadian Natural and Non- Prescription Health Products Directorate (NNHPD) associated with either fish oil52 or borage53 oil use. Therefore, the side effects observed in this study are considered to be of no significant health consequence.The strengths of this study included rigorous monitoring of UV ra-
diation instrument performance, subject’s product dosing compliance, and only minor deviations to the study protocol. Failure to address sub-ject ethnicity within the inclusion/exclusion criteria may be perceived as a trial weakness. However, although there may be real differences in the skin biology of different demographic groups, sorting people effectively into categories has been problematic given the prevailing definitions of race, ethnicity, photo skin type, and pigmentation,54 making it difficult to define those that should have been included and those that should have been excluded from the study based on their ethnic background. The main weakness of the study was the subjec -
tive nature of the MED scoring scale and that the trial design was open label. In addition, a control group of individuals receiving pla-cebo or no intervention and graders being blinded to the interven-tion when reading MEDs would have made the results of this study more convincing. A randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled trial, including a nonsubjective assessment of skin redness using a devise such as a spectrophotometer9 rather than visual inspection, might be appropriate to confirm the beneficial results achieved in this trial. It should also include quantification of pro-  vs anti- inflammatory cytokines to pinpoint the mechanisms underlying the apparent anti-  inflammatory effects indicated by changes in MED, as well as markers for UV- induced DHA damage such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers 55 or oxidative DNA damage such as 8oxo- guanine,56 to determine
the extent of UV protection against DNA damage, if any. Such fu-ture studies are necessary because pure suppression of inflammation without any substantial protection against damage raises the question whether mechanisms of skin adaptation against UV radiation 57 could be adversely affected.5 |  CONCLUSIONBend Skincare Anti- Aging Formula statistically significantly increased the amount of energy needed to produce a MED in subjects treated for as little as 4 weeks. This increase indicated a resistance to UV- induced redness characteristic of sunburn. In addition, this photopro-tection increased with continued product use. Oral supplementation with omega- 6 and omega- 3 fatty acids combined with lutein, zeaxan-thin, and vitamin D may effectively reduce sunburn risk.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSNancy Morse wrote the manuscript, Anna-  Jean Reid reviewed the data, draft and final manuscript, Marc St- Onge reviewed the draft and final manuscript.
