ReviewAge and skin structure and function, a quantitativeapproach (I): blood ﬂow, pH, thickness, and ultrasoundechogenicityJeanette M. Waller1and Howard I. Maibach21University of California, Irvine, CA , USA and2University of California, San Francisco, CA, USABackground/purpose: The aging process has been studiedwith fervor recently, given our shifting demographics. Sinceage’s effects are so manifest in skin’s appearance, struc-ture, mechanics, and barrier function, it is not surprising thatmuch effort has been placed in research to better under-stand them. Quantitative measurements permitted by bioen-gineering have allowed us to objectively and precisely studyaging skin. These overviews piece together the immenseamounts of information that have emerged from recenttechnological advances in dermatological research in orderto develop a uniﬁed understanding of the quantitative effectso fa g eo nt h es k i n .Methods: We performed a literature on age-related changes in
blood ﬂow, pH, skin thickness, and ultrasound imaging data,searching Pub-med, Em-Base, Science Citation Index, and theUCSF dermatological library’s collection of books on the topic ofaging skin.Results: Despite the many tools and techniques availablefor quantitative analysis of skin, age studies are oftenconﬂicting, especially in the areas of blood ﬂow and skinthickness. Trends indicate that blood ﬂow may decreasewith age, especially in sites exposed to the environment. pHapparently varies little until the age of 70, after which itdeclines. Skin thickness data are difﬁcult to interpret; whilethe stratum corneum is generally accepted to maintain itsthickness during aging, dermal, epidermal, and whole skinthickness changes are controversial. Ultrasound reveals theappearance of a subepidermal low echogenic band thatthickens with age, especially in environmentally exposedareas. Some studies also indicate the presence of anechogenic band in the lower dermis which thins with in-
creased age. However, the whole dermis appears to be-come more echogenic in elderly people.Conclusion: M u c hr e m a i n st ob ed o n ei fw ea r et or e a c hconsensus on the effects of age on skin structure andfunction. Future studies would be beneﬁted by increasedstandardization of skin sites tested, methodology, and in-creased sample size.Key words: aging – skin physiology – blood ﬂow – pH –strata – thickness – ultrasound echogenicity&Blackwell Munksgaard, 2005Accepted for publication 16 July 2005THE ANATOMIC facets of skin are inﬁnite, makinga complete review of age-related changes inskin structure problematic.

summary of the effect of age on the parameterdiscussed.Cutaneous blood perfusionCutaneous blood perfusion has been quantita-tively studied in vitro as well as in vivo .In vitrohistologic methods include the study of frozensections stained with alkaline phosphatase formicroscopic analysis. However, this technique isolder and gives only a two-dimensional view,tending to yield overestimates of actual cuta-neous perfusion (1). A more recent immunohis-tochemical method studies specimens of skinstained for the CD31 antigen, the platelet en-dothelial cell adhesion molecule (2).In vivo methods include the use of intravitalcapillaroscopy, including native microscopy andﬂuorescin angiography, for noninvasive three-dimensional vis ualization of cutaneous blood ﬂow(1). Native microscopy uses an epi-illuminatedmicroscope for in vivo viewing of superﬁcialvasculature in immobilized, parafﬁn-treated skin.
vasculature in immobilized, parafﬁn-treated skin.Fluorescin angiography visualizes capillaries afterintravenous administration of a bolus of sodiumﬂuorescin solution (1).Laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (LDF) and laser Dop-pler velocimetry (LDV) are commonly used invivo methods that involve a helium–neon laserlight transmitted to the skin via an optical ﬁber.The laser Doppler signal penetrates to an esti-mated depth of more than 1 mm, giving informa-tion about deeper vessels and arteriovenousanastemoses, not seen by capillaroscopy methods(1). Light reﬂected from nonmoving tissue con-tains radiation at the same frequency as theincident source. Light reﬂected off of movingRBCs, however, is Doppler shifted. The instru-ment extracts the frequency-shifted signal andderives a numerical reading proportional toblood ﬂow (3, 4). LDF and LDV involve essen-tially the same principals, but the instrumentsprocess the information slightly differently such
process the information slightly differently suchthat LDF results in an improved signal-to-noiseratio compared with the LDV (4). Estimates ofcutaneous blood ﬂow obtained using LDF andLDV are reported in arbitrary units and are notabsolute; they are instrument and laboratoryspeciﬁc (5).Photoplethysmography, another optical method,provides a measurement of arterial pulsations ofthe dermal plexus. Infrared radiation is directedin to the skin, scattered, absorbed, and reﬂected,primarily by hemoglobin in the tissue. Backscat-tered radiation is measured and the change ofblood volume in the illuminated tissue is corre-lated to the amount of light absorbed by theblood. Greater blood ﬂow results in greater ab-sorption and less backscattered radiation (4).Table 1 summarizes blood ﬂow data deter-mined from several methodologies. Results ofstudies using LDV or LDF are mixed, apparentlydue to the varying age ranges and small sample
due to the varying age ranges and small samplesizes studied. Fluhr et al. (6) found no signiﬁcantdifference in children vs. adults, but this did notallow for an assessment of changes in elderly skinbecause the average age of the older group wasonly 44 years. Likewise, Kelly et al. (1) found littledifference in blood ﬂow between young (age 18–26) and elderly (age 65–88) subjects; however, theinclusion of only 10 subjects in each age groupdoes not necessarily make it conclusive. An LDFstudy of 201 people aged 10–89 revealed thatareas with high blood ﬂow, such as the lip,cushion of the third ﬁnger, nasal tip and fore-head, blood ﬂow decreased with age (7). How-ever, in areas where the cutaneous bloodperfusion was initially lower, such as the trunk,no clear variation occurred with age (7). Thisstudy also measured cutaneous blood ﬂow andsurface temperature in ﬁnger cushions for 20 minafter a 10-min immersion in 10 1C water. The de-
after a 10-min immersion in 10 1C water. The de-crease in blood ﬂow after immersion was greaterin people over 50, and the restorative abilitypoorer in those over 70, compared with subjectsyounger than 50 (7). Another LDV study foundthat skin’s vasodilation response to heat stressand vasoconstriction in response to cold chal-lenge appears delayed in elderly (age 70–83)
younger than 50 (7). Another LDV study foundthat skin’s vasodilation response to heat stressand vasoconstriction in response to cold chal-lenge appears delayed in elderly (age 70–83)subjects, indicating a possibly reduced vesseldensity in aged skin (8). Again, this study onlyincluded 9–10 people from young and old agegroups, so it may not provide the most conclusiveanswer to the question the effect of age oncutaneous perfusion.Monteiro-Riviere et al. (5) found that bloodﬂow was constant throughout adulthood andincreased in old mice, and that it was constantin adult rats. However, it is unclear whethermurine species can act as an accurate model ofhuman aging, given the different timeline of life,among other factors.Intravital capillaroscopy measurements of 26subjects using ﬂuorescin angiography and nativemicroscopy suggest a decrease in dermal papil-lary loops and little change in horizontal vessels222Waller and Maibach

TABLE 1. Data: cutaneous blood perfusionSource Method Results NotesLaser Doppler velocimetry/laser Doppler ﬂowmetryFluhr et al. (6) Measured the volar forearm of 44 adults, aged 21–44(mean 34.6), and 44 of the adults’ children, aged 1–6(mean 3.5). Measured blood ﬂow by laser Dopplerﬂowmetry LDF-PF2.Children had signiﬁcantly higher blood ﬂow than adults.Children (%): 24.6Adults: 18.7, P50.004Adults are relatively young here; the oldest adult is 44years of age. Thus we may not see the effects of old ageon the skin in this study.Tolino et al. (8) Studied nine healthy men, ages 70–83, and 10 men ages20–30. Studied at ambient temp of 20 1C and 25 1Cduring warm (41 1C) and cool (12 1C) water immersionchallenges, lower legs and right arm and hand wereimmersed. Blood ﬂow was measured continuously inboth forearms by laser Doppler velocimetry.Immersion in 41 1C water lead to peak erythrocyte ﬂuxvalues ofYoung: 140.4 /C616.1 mV
values ofYoung: 140.4 /C616.1 mVElderly: 111.1 /C617.9 mV, Po0.05This study covers a wider distribution of age and mayaccurately reﬂect changes in elderly men’s skin.Before immersion in 12 1C water, baseline ﬂux wereYoung: 36.4 /C63.3 mVElderly: 28.7 /C63m VAfter 12 1C water immersion, ﬂuxes fell toYoung: 16.2 /C62.4 mVElderly: 17.9 /C62.5 mVAuthors conclude that peak vasodilator response to directheat is blunted in aging and may correspond to loss ofskin blood vessels. Also, the proportional response todirect cold challenge is less in the elderly than in theyoung.Fall of erythrocyte ﬂux because of cold water submersionis greater in young subjects ( Po0.05)Kelly et al. (1) Ten young (age 18–26) and 10 old (age 65–88) subjects.Used a laser Doppler ﬂowmeter, attaching one probe tothe forehead and one to the ventral forearm. Basal ﬂow
levels were recorded, then blood ﬂow was occluded for3 min. After 3 min pressure was removed, resulting inpostischemic reactive hyperemia.No signiﬁcant difference was seen between old and youngsubjects in either the forehead or forearm in basal ﬂowlevel, reactive hyperemic peak ﬂow, time taken to returnfrom the peak to a new baseline, and area under theposthyperemic curve. Time taken from pressure releaseto reach posthyperemic peak was less in the elderlyforehead ( P50.056), consistent with more rapid vaso-dilation. This was not seen in the forearm.This study ﬁnds no signiﬁcant difference between bloodﬂow in young and elderly except for more rapid vaso-dilation in response to pressure removal in the fore-head, and this result was barely signiﬁcant.Sample size was fairly small.LDV – Murine dataMonteiro-Riviere et al. (5) Studied male ﬁscher– 344 rats, ages 1, 2, 3, 8, 12, 16, 20,
and 24 months. Also studied CB57BL/CN mice at 1, 2,3, 9, 15, 19, 22 months. N56 per month. Clipped hairover interscapular area of back, measured blood ﬂowusing LDV.Blood ﬂow of mice increased between 1 and 2 months,remained constant to 19 months and then increasedagain at 22 months ( P50.05). Blood ﬂow in ratsincreased between 1 and 2 months, then decreased at 3months and remained constant until 24 months(Po0.05).These results are difﬁcult to interpret in comparison withhuman studies. The effects of age in murine subjectsmay differ from humans because of many factors,including the timeline of the aging process. In rats, age 4months is considered ‘adult’.Intravital capillaroscopy–ﬂuorescin angiographyKelly et al.

Obtained 2 and 4 mm punch biopsyspecimens from eye corners and buttock. Specimenswere stained for the CD31 antigen and histologicallyanalyzed.Chronic photodamage was associated with dramaticallyreduced numbers of cutaneous vessels that were alsoreduced in size.Histological analysis does not provide quantitative, objec-tive data and makes for difﬁcult comparison betweenstudies. Nonetheless, it does qualitatively corroboratedata from other studies revealing reduced vasculaturein photoaged skin.Chung et al.

An immunohistochemical study of 19 indivi-duals ranging from age 20 to 84 revealed littleeffect of intrinsic aging of buttock skin on bloodperfusion, but progressive and marked decreasein cutaneous perfusion in the photoaged eyecorners (2). A photoplethysmographic study in-cluding 69 individuals aged 3–99 revealed sig-niﬁcantly decreased capillary circulation inforehead skin with advancing age. Speciﬁc num-bers were not given, however.A review of this data makes a clear conclusiondifﬁcult; it appears possible that increased agemay be associated with decreased cutaneousperfusion, especially in photo-exposed areas. Fu-ture studies with more subjects may be helpful infurther clarifying our understanding of the effectsof age on cutaneous perfusion.pHSkin’s acidity, an important part of the skin sur-face ecosystem and a contributor to defense
against microbiological or chemical insults, alsoplays a role in skin barrier homeostasis andstratum corneum desquamation (9). Rippke pro-vides an in depth picture of the complex inter-play between pH and skin physiology (9). Today,instruments using a glass planar electrode areprimarily used for pH measurement. They func-tion based on a potential difference created be-tween two environments separated by a thinglass slide. This potential difference is linearlylinked to the difference in H1concentration be-tween the two environments, namely, the skinsurface and the solution contained in a referenceelectrode (HgCl 1KCL) (10).Table 2 summarizes data pertaining to therelation between skin pH and age. pH appearsrelatively constant, at least from childhoodthrough age 70 (6, 11, 12). However, skin surfacepH rises signiﬁcantly in adults near or older than70 years of age. Some have noted that this effect isespecially marked in lower limbs, and therefore
especially marked in lower limbs, and thereforehave attributed the increased pH to stasis andreduced oxygen supply frequently observed onthe lower limbs in older individuals (13). Werespect that even this well-studied parametermay yield new insights when the stratum cor-neum is examined in a microdissected manner(14). Furthermore, pH measurements taken fromthe skin surface should be interpreted cautiouslyas ‘apparent pH’; we are measuring extractedmaterial of SC diffusing into water applied at thestratum corneum surface, where hydrogen ionsare not in solution (15).Skin and skin strata thicknessThe effect of age on the thickness of skin strata isone of the more controversial topics amongdermatological researchers. Comparing measuresof skin layer thickness between individuals (andbetween studies) is especially challenging be-cause of signiﬁcant variation in measurementsbetween individuals and between sites withineach individual.

However,on all other anatomic regions, no signiﬁ-cant differences in skin pH were noted.Authors possibly attribute the pH differencein the ankle to stasis and reduced oxygensupply frequently observed on the lowerlimbs in older individuals.Also, this data still agrees with above infor-mation because it includes adults over 70.Summarizes data pertaining to age-related changes in skin pH.

Many quantitative techniques are also commonlyused in measurement of skin layer thickness.Morphometric analyses of images taken fromlight microscopy, scanning electron microscopy,and transmission electron microscopy, amongother methods, have been used to determine thethickness of various skin layers in vitro . Somehistological methods are questioned because ofpossible artifacts caused by tissue preparation.An older in vivo method, using the skin caliperinstrument, measures the thickness of skin in afold. This technique has lost popularity because itcannot fully eliminate the inﬂuence of the hypo-dermis and does not give the most accuratemeasurements of skin thickness (16). The morerecent use of confocal laser scanning microscopyallows a direct measurement on unmodiﬁed skin,and is considered to be a ‘gold standard’ formeasurement of stratum corneum and epidermalthickness (17). Various radiographic methods arealso available.Pulsed ultrasound has been widely used since
Pulsed ultrasound has been widely used since1982 (18, 19). For the determination of whole skinthickness, ultrasound enables the most exactdetermination without any restriction concerningsite and without disadvantage for the patient(20–24). Incident ultrasonic energy is partially trans-mitted and partially reﬂected at boundary be-tween adjacent structures; this generates echoes,whose amplitudes are characteristic of the natureof the media. An image is formed which can bemeasured either manually or with computerassistance to determine the thickness of the skin.Two forms of ultrasonography, A and B modes,are available. Use of B-mode ultrasonographyrequires more time and attention than A mode(19). While A scan measurements have, at least inmany cases, produced similar results as B scan(22–25), B-mode assessment is more reproduciblebecause it enables cross-sectional imaging. Thisallows for more reliable determination of skin
allows for more reliable determination of skinthickness, even where dermis–hypodermis inter-face unclear. An A scanner only gives a unidi-mensional representation of skin echogenicityand can be problematic where the dermis-sub-cutis interface is ambiguous (19, 26).Seidenari points out the importance of per-forming ultrasound skin thickness measurementsunder standardized conditions, as different re-sults are found in measurements at the same skinsite that employ different gain swept curves.By using a gain curve at a higher level, highermeasurements are recorded (20). Also, differencesin frequencies used may also contribute to varia-tion in results among researchers.Qualitative histologic data from young and oldskin provide a foundation for discussing skinstrata thickness quantitatively. Microscopic ap-pearance of aged skin reveals a thinner epidermisthan young skin, although the intrafollicularepidermis maintains a constant thickness. The
epidermis maintains a constant thickness. Theepidermal thinning is primarily because of aretraction of the rete pegs, resulting in a ﬂattenedinterface between the epidermis and dermis. Oneconsequence is that aged epidermis becomes lessresistant to shearing forces and more easily tornafter trauma (2, 27).The ﬂattening of the interface is also observedhistologically at the ultrastructural level. Inyoung skin, basal cells display numerous villouscytoplasmic projections into the dermis, resultingin a highly convoluted dermal/epidermal inter-face. In contrast, basal cells from aged skin lackthese serrations, and the dermal/epidermal junc-tion is ﬂattened. Hull et al. (27) used scanningelectron microscope to determine that the corru-gated papillary interface between the dermis andepidermis is visible up through the sixth decade;ﬂattening occurs in the sixth through tenth dec-ades. This ﬂattening may also be associated witha decreased proliferative potential of aged epi-

dermis and could also affect absorption (27, 28).Aside from increased basal cell atypia, kerati-nization does not appear markedly differentin aged epidermis. Keratin ﬁlaments, lamellarbodies, and keratohyalin granules are histologi-cally present in usual amounts. The appearanceand number of horny cells does not appear tochange or diminish with age, so the stratumcorneum retains its normal thickness of approxi-mately 14–17 layers (27).Quantitative data on stratum corneum, epider-mal, dermal, and whole skin thickness are pre-sented in Tables 3a, b, c, d, respectively. Ultrasounda n dm i c r o s c o p ys t u d i e sf o c u s i n gs p e c i ﬁ c a l l yo nchanges in SC thickness with age show little or noappreciable change, even up to the age of 97.

However, notethat there is signiﬁcant variation in SC thicknessbetween individuals and between sites within each
between individuals and between sites within eachindividual. Therefore, any future studies of SCthickness should include as large a sample sizeas possible, and should assess multiple sites. Also,newer stratum corneum quantiﬁcation methodsshould add reﬁnement to this knowledge (31).226Waller and Maibach 16000846, 2005, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0909-725X.2005.00151.x by Cochrane Japan, Wiley Online Library on [26/09/2024].

Also, the slightly olderstudy population in the above study may reﬂect differentkinds of changes. Lastly, we must note that the twostudies used different modes of ultrasound. A mode isgenerally considered to be less reproducible. This studydid involve a much larger sample size. Tan et al. (23) Used an A-mode scanner. Skin thickness on volar forearm increased progressively upto age 20, then subsequently decreased markedly.Gniadeckaet al. (38)Used 20 MHz B-mode ultrasonography in 29 men and 61
women, ages 18–94. Study was done in Denmark inwinter, when subjects had no UV exposure for 3 monthsbefore the study.Skin thickness increased with age in the forehead(Po0.0001) and buttock ( P50.0001) but decreased inextremity skin ( Po0.0001). No general/overall relation-ship seen between skin thickness and age.Interesting distinction is made between extremities vs. axialskin. No association is seen between sun-exposed andphoto-protected skin; this may be partially because of theprolonged seasonal lack of UV exposure in this group.Shuster et al.(35)90 males, 107 females, ages 12–93 years, all Caucasian.Biopsies taken from the midpoint of dorsal forearm usinghigh-speed 5 mm punch. Measured skin thickness radio-graphically.In males, skin thinned gradually with age (Po0.001). Infemales, thickness was constant until age 40, after whichit decreased with age ( Po0.001). No r values given.This study used an older in vitro method, possibly subject to
preparation artifacts. The large sample size and broadage range may still be informative.Denda et al.(36)Forehead and cheek. Used an A-mode scanner. Saw decreasing thickness in face w/age. 31% of subjects460 years, whereas Takema (above) only 6% 460 yearsNishimuraet al. (37)Skin thickness on forehead decreases with age.De Rigal et al.(18)25 MHz B-mode ultrasound images taken from the mid volarand dorsal forearm of 142 women, with 10–20 subjects ineach decade of life from age 0–90. Thickness wasdetermined directly by measuring the images.On volar forearm, skin thickness does not vary signiﬁcantlybetween the ﬁrst and seventh decade of life ( Po0.001),but thins ( Po0.05) after the eighth decade.Compared to Tan (1982) and Escofﬁer (1989), de Rigalshows 15% greater skin thickness, attributed to the use ofB scan mode instead of A scan mode. It is noted that use
of B mode makes determination of skin thickness morestraightforward.On dorsal forearm, skin thickens up to 15 years of age(Po0.05), and thinning begins after the seventh decade(Po0.05). Authors attribute thickening of dorsal forearm skin in the ﬁrst
(Po0.05), and thinning begins after the seventh decade(Po0.05). Authors attribute thickening of dorsal forearm skin in the ﬁrst15 years of life to ‘maturation,’ but this could also be areaction to increased UV exposure in childhood, as 80%of UV exposure occurs then.Escofﬁer et al.(15)Measured ventral forearm of 54 men and 64 women, ages0–901. Used 25 MHz ultrasonography, A mode.Skin thickness increases between 0 and 20–30 years of age,Po0.013. No signiﬁcant variation in skin thickness be-tween age 15 and 65. Skin is signiﬁcantly thinner before15 and after 65 years, and is thinner at 90 years than at 5(Po0.05). Across the entire age range, men’s skin isabout 16% thicker than women’s skin ( Po0.001).The Bell-curve type distribution of skin thickness with ageagrees with Leveque et al.

Studies of epidermal thickness agree less. Aconfocal microscopy study of 34 women aged 18–69 found that the living epidermis thins on theback of the arm with increased age (30). Amorphometric analysis of histological sectionsfrom 64 individuals between 20 and 80 yearsfound progressive and signiﬁcant (6.4% per dec-ade) thinning of the epidermis, beginning insubjects as young as 30 years (32). However, amicroscopic study of punch biopsies from thedorsal forearm, buttock, and shoulder included71 people aged 20–68 and found no signiﬁcantchange in epidermal thickness with age (33). It isdifﬁcult to explain these differences betweenstudies, other than to tentatively attribute themto differences in site. Branchet et al. analyzed theupper inner arm, whereas the other studieslooked at different areas. To reach consensus, itmay be important for future studies to focus onstandardized skin sites so that their results can bemore easily compared. Analyses regarding der-
more easily compared. Analyses regarding der-mal thickness reveal similar results: no change onthe back of the arm (33) and progressive thinningon the upper inner arm (32). Again, skin site maybe the main explanatory factor for these contra-dictory results.With studies conﬂicting on whether changesoccur in epidermal and dermal thickness, clearlystudies of whole skin thickness are just as chal-lenging to interpret. An elegant ultrasound studyanalyzed the effects of aging on two anatomicallysimilar areas of neck, one exposed to the sunthroughout life, the other covered. This experi-ment included 30 women aged 81 /C66 years ofage and found thinning of the skin (approxi-mately 0.1 mm difference) in the photoaged re-gion compared with the covered area (34). Alarger study of 170 females aged 17–76 used A-mode ultrasound to ﬁnd signiﬁcant thinning withage on sun-protected skin, and thickening withage on sun-exposed skin (35). The differences
age on sun-exposed skin (35). The differencesbetween these studies might be accounted forby the older population in the study by Richard,or by the use of different modes of ultrasound.Richard et al. (32) suggest that perhaps solarelastosis causes thickening in photoaged skin ofyounger individuals, but that this ceases to occurin older people. Other studies ﬁnd an increase inskin thickness over the ﬁrst 20 years of life then aperiod of either constant skin thickness or pro-gressive thinning, followed by more markedthinning in older individuals, such that a dia-gram of skin thickness vs. age might look like aSauermanet al. (46)Used Vivascope confocal microscope to examine 13 young(18–25 years) and 13 older ( 465 years) volunteers. Atthe volar forearm, measured minimal thickness of theepidermis ( Emin), size of cells in the granular layer ( Agran),thickness of the horny layer (DSC), thickness of the basal
layer (DSB) and number of dermal papillae per area(PapI). Quantitative measurements were made usingimage analysis program image tool.The older group of volunteers showed a signiﬁcant increaseinEminand Agran, no signiﬁcant change in DSC, asigniﬁcant decrease in dermal papillae and in the thick-ness of the basal layer, compared with the younger group.The superﬁcial epidermis appears to be thicker in elderlybecause of larger granular layer cells, and the dermalpapillae and basal layer thinning is consistent with histo-logic data revealing ﬂattening of the rete pegs and basallamina corrugations. Overall, no correlation is seen be-tween whole skin thickness and age.Murine data: whole skin thicknessNgawhirunpatet al. (47)Examined fresh abdominal skin of male Wistar rats at ages5, 10, 21, 90, and 180 days. Fixed the skin specimen,dipped in parafﬁn, cut and stained with H&E, and deter-
mined thickness of skin strata under light microscopy.Thickness of skin strata increased with age. Values for SC,epidermis, epidermis 1dermis, and whole skin were sig-niﬁcant ( Po0.05) at 180 days compared with 5 days.Values for SC, Dermis, epid 1dermis, and whole skin

TABLE 4. Data: ultrasound echogenicitySource Methods Results NotesRichard et al.(32)Included 30 Caucasian women, ages 81 /C66 years with highlifetime exposure to sunlight. Tested two adjacent, ana-tomically equivalent sites, with and without sun exposure,on the neck. Measured skin thickness using B-modeultrasound, 25 MHz probe.SENEB occupies signiﬁcantly greater % of total skin thick-ness and has greater absolute value in sun-exposed skincompared with sun-protected skin:Exposed SENEB: 27 /C61.5%, 0.29 /C60.01 mm.Protected SENEB: 20 /C60.7%, 0.23 /C601 mm.%: (P50.0001) abs: ( P50.0004).SENEB correlates with photoaging.Gniadeckaet al. (38)Used 20 MHz B-mode ultrasonography in 29 men and 61women, aged 18–94. Studied several sites. Measuredechogenicity in the upper and lower dermis (how) andstudied the SLEB. Subjects were not exposed to UV lightfor 3 months prior to the study, which was done inDenmark in the winter.Upper dermis: progressive age-related decrease in echo-
genicity in the in sun exposed regions (dorsal forearm,P50.0002. forehead, P50.004), not seen in moderatelyexposed regions (ventral forearm, ankle). An increase inechogenicity was seen in the buttock ( Po0.0008).Lower dermis: echogenicity increased with age in all sitesexamined ( Po0.002).Authors concluded that a decrease in echogenicity of upperdermis reﬂects photoaging, whereas an increase inechogenicity of lower dermis reﬂects chronologic agingQuestion: why was an increase in echogenicity of upperdermis seen in buttock? Could this be related to issues ofcompression/decompression in that anatomical site,rather than intrinsic age alone?Dorsal forearm: SLEB present in 38 people ages 32–94;thickness increased with age, P50.005.Ventral forearm: SLEB present in 26 people aged 43–94.Forehead: SLEB present in only 17 individuals aged 39–94.Authors saw no signiﬁcant change in thickness of theSLEB in the forehead.The lack of signiﬁcant increase in SLEB thickness in the
forehead with age is attributed to a small sample size.Tsukaharaet al. (42)Tested forehead, eye corners, cheeks, and ventral forearmsof 130 Japanese females aged 18–83 years.Used B-mode ultrasonography at 30 MHz.

Authors state that an age-related decrease inechogenicity in the upper dermal layer reﬂects elastosis,degradation of collagen, accumulation of glycosamino-glycans, and tissue water in papillary dermis. Age related
increase in echogenicity in lower dermal layers representsan accumulation of degraded or disarranged collagen.Overall, saw no age-related change in echogenicity ofdermis as a whole. The SENEB was not seen on the facebut was seen on the ventral side of forearms in elderlypeople (ages not deﬁned). In each layer of the dermis,echogenicity was higher for the forearms than the threesites on the face.It is interesting that SENEB is not seen on the face in thispopulation.De Rigal et al.(18)Obtained ultrasonic B-mode (25 MHz) images from the midvolar and dorsal forearm of 142 women, with 10–20subjects in each decade of life from age 0–90.Volar forearm: SENEB thickness increases linearly with age(r50.844, Po0.0001).DEB decreases linearly with age ( r5/C00.454,Po0.0001) Dorsal forearm: SENEB rises linearly withage ( r50.851, Po0.0001).DEB decreases linearly ( r5/C00.653, Po0.001)
DEB decreases linearly ( r5/C00.653, Po0.001)Overall, the SENEB is more highly correlated with agethan the DEB or skin thickness.Authors observe that individual variation increases with age.

seem to be paradoxical.Pellacani et al.(25)Included 40 Caucasian women. 20 were ages 25–30, and 20were ages 60–90y. Used a 20 MHz B mode scanner.Increased overall echogenicity in elderly subjects comparedto younger subjects at all assessed skin areas exceptinfraorbital regions. An SNEB and a DEB were observableat most facial sites in elderly. Needed to be speciﬁc, ie:lateral forehead regions increased more than central.These ﬁndings, too, of increased overall echogenicity inolder persons, seem to contradict other studies’ ﬁndingsof increasing SENEB thickness and decreasing DEBthickness with age.Gniadeckaet al. (39)Studied volar forearm of 23 volunteers aged 75–100. Used20 MHz B-mode ultrasonography. Collected images twicedaily: in the morning before standing and 12 h later.Conducted study in winter; at least 1 month before the
study the skin was not exposed to UV light. Echogenicityof the subepidermal region was determined by compu-terized image analysis, wherein number of low-echogenicpixels (LEP, 0–30 on scale of 255), were counted. Thisresult was compared with visual scoring and manualmeasurement of subepidermal low echogenic bandthickness.Computerized image analysis: Morning: 303–2299 LEP(median 1167). Afternoon: 255–2347 LEP (median 1133).During the day meaningful changes of pixel values (ex-ceeding 2 SD of the method) were detected in allindividuals; these alterations resembled the diurnalchanges of SLEB thickness.While all of the aged subjects revealed an SLEB, the markedvariation between individuals in this study could not berelated to age. Authors attribute the diurnal variation inechogenicity to possible changes ngravitational inﬂu-ences on body water balance. Computerized imageanalysis gave the most sensitive, reliable, and bias-freemeasurement.
Visual Scoring: SLEB was detected in all individuals, but infour cases (17%) it was described as weak and faint(score 1) and in seven individuals (30%) the score was 2.Well-developed SLEB was observed only in 53% ofcases. Clear diurnal variation was seen in 74% ofpatients.Note that these subjects are unexposed to UV light for theentire winter every year.SLEB thickness measurements were variable. Measure-ments of grades 1 and 2 SLEB was often impossiblebecause of ill-deﬁned borders. Thicknesses ranged from0 to 0.71 mm and displayed diurnal variation in 74% ofpatients. Overall, a negative association exists betweenmorning skin echogenicity and subsequent change inechogenicity; individuals with low morning LEP valueshad high afternoon LEP values; the opposite was alsotrue ( r5/C00.43, P50.002).Presents data on age-related changes in skin echogenicity revealed through ultrasound methods.

bell curve (16, 19, 24, 36). However, using B-modeultrasonography, Pellacani et al. (25) found anincrease in facial skin thickness with age in 40people aged between 25 and 90. Yet other ultra-sound studies show thinning of forehead skinwith age (37, 38). One B-mode ultrasound studyof 61 women aged 18–94 found that skin thick-ness increased on the forehead and buttock butdecreased in extremity skin with increasing age (39).Despite extensive data, it is difﬁcult to deﬁnethe effects of aging on whole skin thickness. Likethe skin strata, individual and regional variationlikely plays a large role in the answer to thisquestion. Also, elastoic effects of chronic sunexposure are probably involved. Furthermore,hormonal differences between individuals andthroughout the aging process may confoundstudies of skin thickness. The effects of estrogenon skin aging are reviewed by Shah and Maibach(40). More concordant future results relating skin
thickness and age might be obtained by greaterstandardization of body site, patient population,and ultrasound method, such that different labo-ratories use the same frequency and gain curves.Ultrasound echogenicityIn addition to data on thickness of skin layers, thevarying degrees of echogenicity in ultrasoundimages provide information regarding changesin collagen structure, elastosis, and other ultra-structural features of the skin. In an ultrasoundimage, a heterogeneous medium generates nu-merous echoes and appears light. A homogenousmedium does not generate as many echoes andappears dark (19). Accumulation of water in thedermis produces more echolucent structures (41).Thickness of a given band of echogenicitycan be determined by inspection and manualmeasurement of the image, or can be mea-sured using newer, more sophisticated imageanalysis systems which assign amplitudes ofechoes for each pixel on an arbitrary scale of 0–
echoes for each pixel on an arbitrary scale of 0–255, segment the image by pixel range, andmeasure regions of echogenicity as speciﬁed bythe investigator (20).Table 4 presents ultrasound echogenicity data.In the ultrasound image of aged skin a subepi-dermal low echogenic band (SLEB or SENEB) is afrequent ﬁnding on many sites, including theface, dorsal and ventral forearm, and neck (19,20, 26, 34, 39, 41). The band of low echogenicity,reported to increase in thickness proportionallyto age, lies in the upper dermis and in some casesoccupies the greatest part of dermal thickness(19). Not seen in young skin, it corresponds toareas histologically deﬁned as elastoic and corre-lates with sun exposure (32). Changes in collagenstructure have also been implicated (19). Addi-tionally, MRI studies indicate that subepidermalregion of aged skin is especially prone to accu-mulate increased amounts of water (41, 42).One study of Japanese women found no SE-
One study of Japanese women found no SE-NEB at all in the facial skin of 130 women aged18–83 (43). One possibility might be a culturaltendency toward careful, lifelong facial sun pro-tection, and that cumulative sun exposure onthe face was not high enough to elicit SENEBformation.An enhancement in lower dermis echogenicityhas also been reported with increasing age andhas been called the dermal echogenic band (DEB)or ‘dermal hyper-reﬂecting band.’ De Rigal re-ports that this band becomes thinner with in-creased age. This too is considered an expressionof chronological and photoaging, although thetrend is somewhat less consistent than with theSENEB (19, 20, 26).Interestingly, some researchers have studiedoverall echogenicity of the dermis and havefound that it decreases with increasing age (20,26, 44). This decrease is surprising, and appearsto contradict the notion that SENEB thickness

ﬁndings.Gniadecka et al. (41) reported another interest-ing concept; they found a diurnal variation inSENEB thickness. People who had a thick SENEBin the morning before rising had a thinner SENEBin the afternoon; the opposite was also true. Theyattributed the negative diurnal correlation togravitational changes in body water balancethroughout the day. If a diurnal variation trulyexists, in addition to individual and body sitevariation, the study of skin echogenicity is indeedmore complicated than once thought. It may benecessary to standardize future studies not onlyin terms of site, but also with respect to time ofday.ConclusionsDespite numerous impressive technological meth-odologies, data regarding age-related changes inskin structure and function are often conﬂicting232Waller and Maibach

Theremay be a trend toward decreased cutaneousperfusion in older individuals, most notably inphotoaged areas; however, future studies withmore subjects will be helpful in further clariﬁca-tion. pH measurements are more concordant; itappears that skin pH is constant throughoutadulthood until approximately 70 years of age,after which it rises signiﬁcantly. This may be inpart due to stasis of blood in elderly individuals,especially in lower limbs (13).We have great difﬁculty in reaching consensusregarding age-related changes in skin stratathickness. Although it is accepted that agingpresents retraction of rete pegs and ﬂattening ofthe epidermal–dermal junction, and though mostagree that stratum corneum maintains relativelyconstant thickness throughout life, quantitativemeasurements of epidermal, dermal, and wholeskin thickness vs. age provide no single answer. It
appears that the epidermis thins with age onsome body sites, such as the upper inner arm(33) and back of the upper arm (29), but remainsconstant on others, such as the buttock, dorsalforearm, and shoulder (30); this variation isclearly not accounted for by sun or environmen-tal exposure alone. Dermal thickness presentssimilar variation.Whole skin thickness has been seen by some toincrease in youth, remain constant during adult-hood, and decrease in the elderly (16, 19, 24, 36).However, others maintain that photoexposedareas thicken with age, whereas protected areasbecome thinner (35). Some suggest that changeswith age are more related to skin’s location on theextremities or axially than to sun exposure (39).Differences in study method, population, andbody site likely account for these markedly dif-ferent results and tend to obscure a reasonableconclusion.Ultrasound echogenicity data in older indivi-duals generally presents a low echogenic band
duals generally presents a low echogenic band(SLEB or SENEB) in the upper dermis that in-creases with age, especially in photoexposedskin. This likely corresponds to elastosis, changesin collagen structure, and water accumulation.Also, authors tend to see a high echogenic band(DEB) in the lower dermis, which apparentlybecomes thinner with increased age. Paradoxi-cally, measures of echogenicity of the dermis as awhole reveal an increase with age (20, 26, 44).Clearly, more work remains if we are to reachagreement on the effects of age on skin. The greatTABLE 5. Recommendations for future studiesProblem RecommendationInterindividualvariationA. Larger sample sizes to justify signiﬁcance. Given the tremendous range of variation in skin bioengineeringparameters, researchers should consider designing studies using power calculations, wherein before the study, theydetermine what would be a clinically relevant difference in measurement between young and old skin ( d), a
signiﬁcance level ( a, usually 0.05) and power level (1 /C0b, usually 0.8). For a test comparing means of measure-ments, sample size needed for signiﬁcance at the speciﬁed level is calculated as follows:n52/C2[z(1/C0a/2)1z(1/C0b)]2/(d/s)2.Values for z(1/C0a/2)and z(1/C0b)for 5% signiﬁcance and 80% power, respectively, are 1.96 and 0.8416. The use ofpower calculations assumes a normal distribution of the data and equal numerical allocation of participants to thegroups being compared (48).B. Given the likely signiﬁcant effects of age-associated hormonal changes on the skin (40), studies should attempt tonormalize for or at least regularly report differences in hormonal status among groups tested.IntraindividualvariationA. The average of three measurements should be recorded at any test site (ie statistics should analyze the mean ofthree skin thickness measurements on a certain region of the skin to help minimize ‘noise’ of individual variation) (48).
B. Standardization of skin sites tested; for example, we could agree to focus research on a limited number of speciﬁc
B. Standardization of skin sites tested; for example, we could agree to focus research on a limited number of speciﬁcareas that ideally address issues of lifelong environmental exposure; we suggest, somewhat arbitrarily: (1) the mid-volar forearm, exactly halfway between the centers of the wrist and elbow joints, (2) the mid-dorsal forearm, exactlyhalfway between the centers of wrist and elbow joints, (3) the mid upper-inner arm, exactly halfway between the mid-axilla and elbow joint, (4) the exact center of the forehead, (5) the upper-mid buttock, 3 cm below the iliac crest andhalfway between the midline and left or right border, so as to minimize effects of lifelong compression anddecompression that occurs on the lower buttock, (6) the midline of the back, over spinous process of T2.Instrument andother measure-ment-relatedvariationA. Standardization of, or at the very least accurate and consistent reporting of settings used on bioengineering tools,
including frequency settings and gain swept curves on ultrasonography machines.B. As diurnal variation has been demonstrated in skin thickness and echogenicity studies (39, 49, 50), and may also bea factor in blood ﬂow and water content, studies should be designed to minimize this variation; all individuals shouldbe tested at the same or comparable time of day and timing of the measurements should be reported, if notstandardized.Presents several recommendations that may help to decrease variation among future studies.233Age and skin structure and function 16000846, 2005, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0909-725X.2005.00151.x by Cochrane Japan, Wiley Online Library on [26/09/2024].

inter- and intra-individual variation seen in humanskin makes this ﬁeld challenging, especially asvariation increases with age (19). Future researchwould be greatly beneﬁted by the developmentof more universal, standardized protocols, in-cluding larger study populations, standardiza-tion of hormonal/menopausal status in agedgroups, a limited number of speciﬁc skin sitesto be tested, and increased consistency of experi-mental method and equipment.
