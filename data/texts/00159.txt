Effects of Mesenchymal StemCell-Derived Exosomes onAutoimmune DiseasesZiwei Shen1,2, Wei Huang1,2, Jun Liu1,2, Jie Tian2, Shengjun Wang2and Ke Rui1,2*1Department of Laboratory Medicine, Af ﬁliated Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China,2Department ofImmunology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, ChinaRecent years, the immunosuppressive properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)have been demonstrated in preclinical studies and trials of in ﬂammatory and autoimmunediseases. Emerging evidence indicates that the immunomodulatory effect of MSCs isprimarily attributed to the paracrine pathway. As one of the key paracrine effectors,mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-EXOs) are small vesicles 30-200 nm indiameter that play an important role in cell-to-cell communication by carrying bioactivesubstances from parental cells. Recent studies support the ﬁnding that MSC-EXOs have
an obvious inhibitory effect toward different effector cells involved in the innate andadaptive immune response. Moreover, substantial progress has been made in thetreatment of autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupuserythematosus (SLE), type-1 diabetes (T1DM), uveitis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), andinﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD). MSC-EXOs are capable of reproducing MSC functionand overcoming the limitations of traditional cell therapy. Therefore, using MSC-EXOsinstead of MSCs to treat autoimmune diseases appears to be a promising cell-freetreatment strategy. In this review, we review the current understanding of MSC-EXOs anddiscuss the regulatory role of MSC-EXOs on immune cells and its potential application inautoimmune diseases.Keywords: mesenchymal stem cells, exosomes, immunoregulation, therapy, autoimmune diseases1 INTRODUCTIONMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells with the capacity for self-renewal and
multidirectional differentiation into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and other types of cells(1,2). MSCs are widely distributed in the body and have been isolated from a variety of tissues,among which the bone marrow and subcutaneous fat are common cellular sources ( 3). TheInternational Committee established the recognition characteristics of human MSCs, includingunder standard culture conditions to maintain adhesion appearance, expression of CD105, CD73,and CD90 molecules, no expression of CD45, CD34, CD14, CD45, CD11b, CD79a, CD19, andHLA-DR, with the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes in vitro (4). Inaddition to its strong differentiation capacity, MSCs also have immunomodulatory potential tomodulate innate and adaptive immune cells ( 5). Abundant evidence indicates that MSCs can act onnatural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, B lymphocytes, and T lymphocytes via

inhibiting the activation, proliferation and differentiation intoeffector cells ( 6–9). Following stimulation with in ﬂammatoryfactors, MSCs exhibit the properties of reducing theinﬂammatory response, improving tissue repair, and avoidinginfection by secreting various immune regulatory factors ( 10). Atpresent, substantial evidence suggests that MSCs exert theirimmunomodulatory function through paracrine pathway,especially viaexosomes ( 10,11).Extracellular vesicles(EVs) are a family of particles/vesiclesf o u n di nb l o o da n db o d y ﬂuids. They are composed ofphospholipid bilayer and carry a variety of molecules thatserve as mediators for intercellular communication ( 12). In1946, Chargaffaf et al. suspected the existence of EVs andpublished the ﬁrst study of EVs ( 13). It was not until 1967 thatWolf et al. con ﬁrmed the existence of EVs with electronmicroscopy (EM) ( 14). The term exosome ( “exo ”=external, “some ”= body) was introduced in the 1970s, and it
wasn ’t until 1981 that the term “exosome ”wasﬁrst used byTrams to refer to Evs ( 15). Shortly after Johnstone et al. describedmultivesicular bodies (MVBs) and their 40-80nm exosomes in1985 ( 16), differential centrifugation and ultracentrifugationabove 100,000 g were used to separate and distinguish thesmallest vesicles ( 17). With the increase in EVs (especiallyexosomes) publications, most studies do not clearly distinguishexosomes from other vesicles. To address this problem, in 2013,the International Extracellular Vesicle Society (ISEV) proposed aset of criteria for EV Science ( 18). In order to ensure normativeresearch, the Minimal Information of Studies of ExtracellularVesicles (MISEV) was revised in 2018 to update knowledge intheﬁeld (19).Exosomes are spherical vesicles composed of lipid bilayermembranes with a diameter of 40-200 nm, which contain
complex and abundant active substances such as proteins andnucleic acids. Expression of exosome markers, proteins, nucleicacids, and other bioactive molecules is related to the cell of origin(20). There is increasing evidence that MSC-derived exosomes(MSC-EXOs) play an important role in immune regulation.MSC-EXOs are spherical vesicles secreted by MSCs thatcontain many anti-in ﬂammatory compounds and modulate theimmune response by interacting with immune effector cells ( 12).In the treatment of autoimmune diseases, MSC-EXOs as a carrierof cell-free therapy have attracted extensive attention, becausethey not only carry most of the therapeutic effects of MSC itself,but also reduce the concerns about the safety of injecting livecells. MSC-EXOs has signi ﬁcant advantages over MSCs inclinical treatment and may completely replace MSC therapy inthe future.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF MESENCHYMALSTEM CELL-DERIVED EXOSOMESBoth eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells release EVs, which are
regarded as a part of their normal physiology and acquiredabnormalities ( 20). EVs represent an important substance forintercellular communication. They participate in normalphysiological processes, as well as play a critical role indisease occurrence and progression. Numerous experimentaland clinical studies have shown that the immunomodulatoryeffects of MSCs can be primarily attributed to MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) ( 21). Although theclassi ﬁcation of EVs is constantly evolving, it is generallyaccepted that EVs are classi ﬁed into three main categoriesaccording to their size and biogenesis: apoptotic bodies (ABs),microvesicles, and exosomes ( 22–24). ABs (greater than 1,000nm in diameter) are comprised of relatively large fragments ofcells containing organelles derived from the cells undergoingapoptosis, which are transferred to phagocytes ( 25,26).Microvesicles (100 –1,000 nm in diameter) and exosomes (40 –
apoptosis, which are transferred to phagocytes ( 25,26).Microvesicles (100 –1,000 nm in diameter) and exosomes (40 –200 nm in diameter) belong to EVs at the nano level.Microvesicles, also known as ectosomes or microparticles, arereleased into the extracellular environment after directly buddingor shedding from the plasma membrane ( 27). Exosomesoriginate from the endosomal pathway. Extracellular materialfuses with early endosomes (ESEs) through membraneinvagination and endocytos is, and gradually matures anddevelops into late endosomes (LSEs). The invagination of LSEsleads to the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), andmultiple vesicles assemble to form MVBs, which fuse with thecell membrane and are subsequently released ( Figure 1 )(20).With regards to the delivery of exosome contents, exosomes can
be bound by target cells through multiple pathways, of which themain mechanisms include endocytosis, ligand-receptor binding,or direct binding ( Figure 1 )(28–31). Exosomes are formed bybudding through the endosome pathway and are wrapped in alipid bilayer, contents of which can be protected by the externalenvironment to maintain exosome integrity.Exosomes contain a large number of proteins, lipids,transcription factors, as well as DNA, mRNA, and miRNA ( 32,33). Exosome membranes contain lipid raft structures composedof cholesterol, spingomyosin, and ceramide and the tetraspaninprotein family (CD63, CD81, and CD9) as an exosome marker(34). Exosomes also contain other common proteins, includingMVB biogenesis proteins (Alix, TSG101, and ESCRT Complex),membrane transporter and fusion proteins (RAB protein,GTPases, and annexins), heat shock proteins (HSP60, 70, and90), lipid related proteins, and phospholipases ( 35). Notably,
MSC-EXOs express not only common surface markers such asCD81 and CD9, but also mesenchymal stem cell surface markers(CD44, CD73, and CD90) by ﬂow cytometry ( 34). Proteomicanalysis of exosomes isolated from human bone marrow-derivedmesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSC)provided evidence of 730functional proteins associated with MSC proliferation, adhesion,migration, and morphogenesis ( 36). Surprisingly, proteinpackaging in exosomes is not random, because human primedMSCs secrete exosomes (pMEX), compared to human primedMSCs (pMSC), has a high concentration of speci ﬁc subcategoriesof proteins, including secretory proteins and extracellular matrix(ECM) associated proteins, which may provide the molecularbasis for its unique functional properties ( 37). In addition toproteins, MSC-EXOs also contain numerous RNA. Interestingly,Shen et al. Effects of MSC-EXOS on AIDFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 749192 2
RNA is speci ﬁcally incorporated into exosomes, where itaccumulates and then enters the recipient cell to do its job(38). Interestingly, enrichment of MSC-EXOs with network-informed miRNA further enhanced the intrinsic ability ofMSC-EXOs to prevent apoptosis, promote angiogenesis andinduce myocardial cell proliferation ( 39). MSC-EXOs changethe activity and function of target cells primarily through thehorizontal transfer of these substances ( Figure 1 ). Due to thelack of speci ﬁc markers, MSC-EXOs are currently preparedaccording to size or density. Most laboratories separateexosomes from conditioned media viahypercentrifugation,which cannot differentiate exosomes from other EVs orbiological macromolecules ( 40). The MISEV2018recommendsusing the generic term “small/medium/large EVs ”based on itssize or density, rather than the classic terms “exosome ”,“vesicle ”,
and “apoptotic body ”(19). However, most of the current articlescontinue to use classic terms. The sizes of small/medium/largeEVs are partially overlapped and cannot be strictly distinguished.Therefore, this review takes a cautious attitude towards theabsolute de ﬁnition of different types of vesicles, and focuses onthe effects of nanoscale EVs (e.g., exosomes on immune cells)and various autoimmune diseases.Numerous studies have shown that MSC-EXOs exhibit similarfunctions to that of MSCs (e.g., repairing damaged tissues,regulating immune responses, and playing anti-in ﬂammatoryeffects) ( 10,41). Although MSC therapy is widely regarded as aneffective therapy for several immunological diseases, the directtherapeutic effect of MSCs remains limited. Due to the relativelylarge size of MSCs, intravascular administration may lead tovascular obstruction, which can result in pulmonary embolismand death in severe cases ( 42). In addition, allogenic immune
rejection or abnormal chromosomal differentiation may occurABCFIGURE 1 | Biogenesis and components of exosomes. (A)Exosomes originate from the endosomal pathway. Extracellular material enters the cytoplasm throughplasma membrane depression and endocytosis, and fuses with early endosomes, endoplasmic reticulum and preformed Golgi bodies, to develop into lateendosomes, which are interlinked with the cell membrane network structure to form ILVs containing a vesicle structure. Different concentrations an d sizes of ILVsconstitute MVBs. On the one hand, MVBs fuse with lysosomes, degrade the contents, and release them into the cytoplasm. On the other hand, MVBs aretransferred to the cytoplasmic membrane through the membrane system and vesicles are released outside the cell, which are termed exosomes. (B)Exosomes canact by binding to receptors present on the surface of target cells, by binding to endocytosis, or by the direct binding to recipient cells. (C)Exosome components.

during in vivo transplantation, and even malignant tumors mayform ( 43). Also, MSCs cells age rapidly and are expensive to have alarge-scale production ( 44). Using MSC-EXOs in humans hasseveral potential advantages over MSCs. First, nano-scaleexosomes are free to pass through various biological barrierswithout blocking microvascular circulation. Second, theirapplication effectively prevents the metastasis of DNA-mutatedcells and hinders the tumor development. Third, the number ofMSCs decreases rapidly following transplantation, whereas thedelivery of MSC-EXOs can continue to function in the body ( 10).In addition, MSC-EXOs are considered to be non-immunogenicand can be produced in a large-scale production for clinicapplication ( 44). However, toxicological studies of nanoparticlesin vivo still need to be fully evaluated, particularly following long-term exposure ( 45). Moreover, the discovery of a broad
therapeutic effect of exosome-mediated MSCs eliminates manyof the challenges associated with the use of living replicative cells,as it fundamentally shifts living-cell-based MSCs therapy to a“cell-free ”treatment, reducing the risk of living cell therapy.Therefore, MSC-EXOs, as cell-secreted natural EVs, has theadvantage of being an ideal nanoscale drug carrier.3 IMMUNOMODULATORY FUNCTIONOF MESENCHYMAL STEM CELL-DERIVED EXOSOMES3.1 Innate Immunity3.1.1 MacrophagesAs an important aspect of the innate immune system,macrophages originate from either the yolk sac duringembryonic development or bone marrow-derived monocytes(46). Under microenvironmental activation, macrophages mayevolve into an M1 phenotype of pro-in ﬂammatory macrophagesor an M2 phenotype of anti-in ﬂammatory macrophages. Ingeneral, M1 macrophages secrete pro-in ﬂammatory molecules,including TNF- aand IL-1 b, whereas M2 macrophages secreteimmune regulatory factors (e.g., IL-10) ( 47). Recent data support
theﬁndings that the anti-in ﬂammatory effect of MSC-EVs isinseparably related to macrophage polarization. MSC-EVs inhibitpro-in ﬂammatory M1 macrophage activation and promote theirpolarization to M2 macrophages, which are consistent with adecrease in the levels of VEGF-A, IFN- g, IL-12, and TNF- a,a n dan upregulation of IL-10 ( 48,49). Previous studies have reportedthat macrophages are the main target cells for MSC-EVs toalleviate colon in ﬂammation. In dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, MSC-EVs effectively alleviate colitis by inducingan immunosuppressive M2 phenotype exhibited by colonicmacrophage polarization. Compared with the control group,MSC-EV-treated mice produced a greater number of IL-10-producing M2 macrophages ( 49). Similarly, in a study of sepsisconducted by Song et al., the authors demonstrated that MSC-EVs promoted M2 macrophage polarization. Human umbilicalcord-derived MSCs(hUC-MSCs) pretreated with IL-1 beffectively
induce macrophage polarization into an anti-in ﬂammatory M2phenotype viaexosomal miR-146a, which ultimately resulted inprolonging the survival of sepsis mice ( 50). Moreover, the resultsshowed that MSC-EVs down-regulated the production of IL-23and IL-22, enhanced the anti-in ﬂammatory phenotype of maturehuman regulatory macrophages (Mregs), which led to a weakenedTh17 response ( 51). Zhao et al. reported that adipose-derivedMSC-EXOs(AD-MSC-EXOs) promoted an M2 macrophagepolarization by activating STAT3 transcription, up-regulatingthe expression of IL-10 and Arg-1 in macrophages, therebyinhibiting the in ﬂammatory response of macrophages ( 52). Inaddition, in the rat model of experimental autoimmune uveitis(EAU), Bai et al. demonstrated that MSC-EXOs treatmentdownregulated the proportion of CD68+macrophages in theretina and demonstrated the down-regulation of MSC-EXOs onmacrophage migration to the retina ( Figure 2 )(53). Interestingly,
+macrophages in theretina and demonstrated the down-regulation of MSC-EXOs onmacrophage migration to the retina ( Figure 2 )(53). Interestingly,MSC-EXOs also enhanced the immunosuppressive function ofmacrophage precursor, which is called myeloid-derivedsuppressor cells (MDSCs), a heterogeneous population ofimmature Myeloid derived cells. IL-6 secreted by olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cell-deri ved exosomes (OE-MSC-EXOs)activates the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in MDSCs, and enhancesthe inhibitory function of MDSCs by upregulating the levels ofarginase, ROS and NO ( 54). In addition, abundant S100A4 in OE-MSC-EXOs mediated endogenous IL-6 production of MDSCsthrough TLR4 signaling, and along with exosomal-derived IL-6promotes the immunosuppressive function of MDSC ( 54).3.1.2 Natural Killer CellsNK cells are important effector cells in the innate immune
response and play an important role in the host pathogendefense. When pathogens invade a host, they kill target cells byreleasing cytotoxic particles containing perforin and granzyme(55). Although autoimmune diseases are primarily caused by Tand B lymphocytes, NK cells possess excessive activation andinhibitory receptors, which c an play a role in regulatingautologous cell reactivity ( 56). In addition, NK cells mayregulate the activity of other immune cells by secretingcytokines and in ﬂuence the development of the adaptiveimmune response through these pathways ( 57). MSC-EVsprimarily induce an immunosuppressive effect on NK cells,including the proliferation, activation, and cytotoxicity of NKcells. In a rat model of EAU, an injection of MSC-EXOs aroundthe eye restored EAU damage by downregulating the transport ofCD161+NK cells in the lesion ( 53). Recent studies have shown
that human fetal liver (FL) MSC-derived exosomes(hFL-MSC-EXOs) mediated downstream TGF- b/Smad signal transductionthrough the surface expression of TGF- bto inhibit theproliferation and activation of NK cells ( 58). In human graft-versus host disease (GVHD) experiments, researchers noted thatMSC-EXOs suppressed the release of IFN- gand TNF- abyactivated NK cells, which reduced the cytotoxic effect of NKcells, and lessened the in ﬂammatory response ( Figure 2 )(59).3.1.3 Dendritic CellsDCs play an immunological role as antigen presenting cells(APCs), which can ingest, process, and present antigens to Tand B lymphocytes ( 60). Most DCs in the body are immatureDCs (iDCs) under normal circumstances and express low levelsShen et al. Effects of MSC-EXOS on AIDFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 749192 4
of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC II) and T cellcostimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, and CD40). In addition,iDCs up-regulate the surface expression of MHC II andcostimulatory molecules after ingesting antigens or cytokinestimulation, and are converted into mature DC (mDCs) ( 61).Previous studies indicate that the immunosuppressive effect ofMSC-EVs on DCs is primarily realized by inhibiting DCmaturation and activation. In the presence of MSC-EVs, iDCsare impaired in their ability to receive antigens and differentiatemDCs, which results in the decreased expression of mature andactivation markers (e.g., CD83, CD38 and CD80), andcorrespondingly decreased the secretion of pro-in ﬂammatorycytokines (i.e., IL-6 and IL-12p70) ( 62). At the same time, MSC-EVs can also enhance the release of TGF- band IL-10 in CD11c+DCs, thereby inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation ( 63).Researchers suggest that MSC- EVs treatment inhibits cell
surface expression of MHC II and costimulatory molecules onCD11c+cells in a dose-dependent manner. The results showedthat DCs exhibited a hypoactive phenotype and therebysuppressed the subsequent T cell activation and proliferation(64). Moreover, the co-culture of MSC-EV-treated DCs with Tcells reduced Th17 cell counts and IL-17 levels, and increasedFoxp3+regulatory T cells. This ﬁnding is consistent with theprevious conclusion ( 65). In brief, there was a weakened ability ofiDCs co-cultured with MSC-EXOs to differentiate into mDCs.This led to an inability to perform antigen presentation andeffectively stimulate T lymphocyte proliferation. In contrast, itpromoted an increase in Treg cells, which indirectly re ﬂectedthat MSC-EXOs can enhance host immune tolerance ( Figure 2 ).3.2 Adaptive Immunity3.2.1 B CellsB cells are important adaptive immune cells, whose mainfunctions are to mediate humoral immunity and secrete
antibodies. The regulation of MSC-EVs on B lymphocytes wasinvestigated in vitro . In the CpG-stimulated PBMC co-culturesystem, MSC-EVs can completely replicate the inhibitory effectof MSCs on immunoglobulin secretion, B cell proliferation anddifferentiation in a dose-dependent manner ( 66,67). Budoniet al. also claimed that MSC-EVs were internalized by activatedCD19+/CD86+B cells to inhibit B cell proliferation,differentiation, and antibody production, as well as inhibitmemory B cell maturation ( 68). There are functional B cellsubsets, known as regulatory B cells (Bregs). The key function ofBregs is to release IL-10, which inhibits the production ofproin ﬂammatory cytokines and supports regulatory T celldifferentiation ( 69). MSC-EVs exert dose-dependent anti-inﬂammatory effects by inhibiting B cell maturation andinducing Bregs in lymph nodes in a murine model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and del ayed-type hypersensitivity
(DTH). Moreover, MSC-EVs also regulate cellular functionFIGURE 2 | The effects of MSC-EVs on immune effector cells.Shen et al. Effects of MSC-EXOS on AIDFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 749192 5
through the differential expression of mRNA in related genes.Researchers found that MSC-EVs induced B cells to down-regulate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway through miR-155-5p,inhibited B cell proliferation and reduced the activation capacityof B lymphocytes ( 70). Real-time PCR analysis con ﬁrmed thatfollowing exosome treatment from MSC sources, the expressionof genes that played an important role in B cell immuneregulation (e.g., CXCL8 and MZB1) were upregulated ( 67).These studies con ﬁrmed that MSC-EXOs can play animmunomodulatory role by acting on B cells ( Figure 2 ).3.2.2 T CellT cell proliferation and activation contribute to the occurrenceand development of many autoimmune diseases. MSC-EVs playa negative role in T cell proliferation and activation. MSC-EVshave been shown to carry a variety of active molecules, includingTGF- b(68,71), IDO protein ( 72), and miR-125a-3p ( 73). Thesemolecules give MSC-EVs the ability to inhibit T cell proliferation
and activation. Studies have revealed that adenosine is associatedwith a robust immunosuppressive effect, and MSC-EVs inhibitsTc e l lp r o l i f e r a t i o n in vitro through adenosine signaltransduction ( 74). MSC-EVs can also adjust the balance of Thelper type 1 (Th1) and T helper type 2 (Th2) cells andreconstruct the stable state of Th1 and Th2. Chen et al. co-cultured bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC)-derived exosomes (BM-MSC-E XOs) and peripheral bloodmononuclear cells. The authors subsequently found that itcould promote the Th1 to Th2 conversion of helper T cells,signiﬁcantly reduced the levels of pro-in ﬂammatory factors, IL-1band TNF-a, and improved the levels of anti-in ﬂammatoryTGF- b(66). In a similar study, human adipose tissue MSC-EXOsinhibited the differentiation and activation of T cells and therelease of pro-in ﬂammatory factors (e.g., IFN- g)(75). In
addition, MSC-EXOs can facilitate the differentiation of Tregs.Treg cells are immune cells with negative feedback regulation.Similarly, in ﬂammatory IL-1 b-primed MSC-EVs upregulatedPD-L1 and TGF- bexpression, which induced the apoptosis ofactivated T cells, and increases the proportion of Treg cells in amouse model of autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( 76). Previousstudies in our laboratory have also found that OE-MSC-EXOshad a potent inhibitory effect on the proliferation of CD4+T cellsin experimental colitis mice. At the same time, the secretion ofIL-17 and IFN- gby T cells was reduced, whereas the secretion ofTGF- band IL-10 was enhanced, which could signi ﬁcantly slowdisease progression ( 77). Following treatment with OE-MSC-EXOs, the Th1/Th17 subsets were signi ﬁcantly reduced, whileTreg cells were increased ( 77). It was found that transgene-freehuman induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived EVs couldprevent the progression of Sjögren ’s syndrome (SS) by inhibiting
the differentiation of follicular helper T (Tfh) and Th17 cells ( 78).In addition, other studies have reported that MSC-EXOs canpromote the differentiation of monocytes into an M2macrophage phenotype, thereby activating the differentiationof CD4+T cells into Treg cells and delaying the occurrence ofimmune rejection ( Figure 2 )(79).4 APPLICATIONS OF MESENCHYMALSTEM CELL-DERIVED EXOSOMES INAUTOIMMUNE DISEASESTo develop EVs as a cell-free therapy and elucidate its potentialrole in stem cell effects in vivo , the following contents can assessthe role of exosomes released by MSCs in the treatment ofautoimmune diseases, including Multiple sclerosis (MS),Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Type-1 diabetes (T1DM),uveitis, Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and In ﬂammatory boweldisease (IBD) ( Table 1 ).4.1 Multiple SclerosisMS is the most common in ﬂammatory disease of the central
nervous system (CNS), which is characterized by demyelination,neuronal damage and loss, and ultimately neurologicaldysfunction ( 80). Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
nervous system (CNS), which is characterized by demyelination,neuronal damage and loss, and ultimately neurologicaldysfunction ( 80). Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis(EAE) is the commonly used animal model of MS ( 81). As theprimary immune cells of the central nervous system, microgliacan maintain tissue homeostasis and contribute to centralnervous system development under normal physiologicalconditions ( 82). Following pathogen invasion, activatedmicroglia with an M1 phenotype as the ﬁrst line of defensesecrete pro-in ﬂammatory cytokines t oe l i m i n a t ei n v a d i n gpathogens. However, when tissue homeostasis is restored,microglia exhibiting an M2 phenotype need to be activated,otherwise the excessive release of pro-in ﬂammatory cytokinescan lead to neuronal damage ( 83). Microglia have both
neurodestructive and neuroprotective functions. An imbalanceof the M1/M2 phenotype inhibits the nerve protection functionand promotes the occurrence of MS ( 84). Therefore, M1 to M2polarization of microglia may be bene ﬁcial to theneuroprotective function of microglia, thereby preventingdisease progression. The study by Zijian et al. demonstratedthat BM-MSC-EXOs therapy inhibits microglia from developinginto an M1 phenotype, promotes M2 phenotype polarization,and secretes anti-in ﬂammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF- a, IL-10,and TGF- b). Moreover, BM-MSC-EXOs treatment signi ﬁcantlyimproved the neurobehavioral symptoms of EAE rats andrelieved the in ﬂammation and demyelination of CNS ( 85).Human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs)-EVs fromMS patients has been shown to inhibit NALP3 in ﬂammasomeactivation in an EAE model ( 86). Although substantial progress
has been made in the treatment of MS, the appropriate treatmentfor MS remains controversial. The currently available drugs mayhave potentially harmful side effects and cannot meet futureneeds ( 87). MSC-EXOs is a natural non-toxic vesicle that candeliver mRNA, miRNA, and proteins, as well as alleviate thecondition of EAE by regulating microglia polarization ( 88). Asthe carrier of MSC-speci ﬁc tolerance molecules (e.g., PD-L1,Galecin-1 [GAL-1], and TGF- b), MSC-EVs can effectivelyinhibit the activation and proliferation of self-respondinglymphocytes and promote the secretion of anti-in ﬂammatorycytokines derived from lymphocytes, thereby alleviating EAEdisease progression ( 76). In another study, it was also shown thatShen et al. Effects of MSC-EXOS on AIDFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 749192 6

the in ﬁltration of microglia in spinal cord sections treated withMSC-EXOs was signi ﬁcantly reduced, and MSC-EXOs inducedthe formation of Tregs and alleviated the development of EAE(89). Therefore, MSC-EXOs may hold great potential for thetreatment of MS.4.2 Systemic Lupus ErythematosusSLE is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by immuneinﬂammation and multiple organ damage. In addition, SLEpathogenesis is extremely complex, primarily due to thecomprehensive in ﬂuence of genetic, environmental, hormonal,epigenetic, and other factors ( 90). With the help of Tfh cells, anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are produced, leading to thedeposition of immune complexes in vital organs. The immunecomplex triggers an in ﬂux of large in ﬂammatory cells by activatingthe complement cascade, causing tissue in ﬂammatory damage(e.g., nephritis) ( 91). Nephritis represents the leading cause of
morbidity and mortality in SLE and occurs in approximately halfof all patients ( 92). In previous studies, researchers found that theinfusion of hBM-MSCs into mouse models of lupus nephritisreduced the level of autoantibodies, improved the survival rate inmice, and alleviated the clinical symptoms of glomerulonephritisby inhibiting the development of Tfh ( 91). Moreover, the loss ofBM-MSC/osteoblast function in an SLE mouse model results in animpairment of the osteoblastic niche and an imbalance of immunehomeostasis. Allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem celltransplantation (MSCT) plays a positive role in reconstructingthe osteoblast niche and restoring immune homeostasis; thus,effectively reversing multiple organ dysfunction ( 93). The aboveﬁndings con ﬁrm a positive therapeutic effect of MSCs on SLE;
however, cellular therapy continues to face technical, cost, andregulatory challenges in clinical trials. Recent studies havedemonstrated that the immunoregulatory activity of MSCs wasmainly mediated by paracrine factors (e.g., MSC-EVs) ( 66). In anovel porcine model of coexisting metabolic syndrome (MetS) andrenal artery stenosis (RAS), MSC-EVs isolated from adipose tissuewere capable of improving renal structuring and function, andreducing renal injury and dysfunction by up-regulating the level ofIL-10 expression ( 94). Although MSC-EVs have been observed toinhibit autoimmune diseases in vitro , there have been no studieson the use of MSC-EVs for the treatment of SLE in mice orhumans. In the future, MSCs are expected to provide a novel andsafe treatment for SLE patients.4.3 Type-1 DiabetesT1DM is considered a chronic autoimmune disease that isinﬂuenced by genetic, immune, and environmental factors(95). T1DM is primarily caused by the autoimmune
(95). T1DM is primarily caused by the autoimmunedestruction of beta-cells in the islets of Langerhans, leading toinsufﬁcient insulin secretion ( 96). Non-obese diabetic (NOD)mice are the preferred spontaneous disease model of T1DM.NOD mice exhibited the same clinical symptoms of diabetes ashuman beings-hyperglycemia, polyuria, and polydipsia ( 95).Although insulin therapy remains the main treatment methodin the short term, MSCs have recently attracted wide attention asa promising method for the treatment of diabetes ( 96). MSCsdisplay immunomodulatory properties in in ﬂammatory diseases,TABLE 1 | ContinuedDiseasetypesAnimal model ExosomessourcesExosomes reactive molecules Target cells/tissueMechanism of action Effect RefTargets the expression of NEDD8 (neuralprecursor cell-expressed, developmentallydownregulated gene 8)BM-MSCs miR-146a Colonic epithelialcellsInhibits TNF receptor-associated factor 6(TRAF6) and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1

and their immunomodulatory effects have been studied inT1DM ( 97,98). Human MSCs have the ability to delay theonset of autoimmune diabetes by inhibiting the development ofTh1 cells, which may improve the ef ﬁcacy of islet transplantationin patients with T1DM ( 99). Currently, it is generally believedthat a paracrine mechanism of action is more direct in MSCsin vivo , particularly MSC-EXOs ( 10). In previous studies, theeffect of MSC-EXOs on diabetes has been investigated. Previousstudies have shown that exosomes released by BM-MSCs hadsimilar functions to those of BM-MSCs, and they had the abilityto improve cognitive impairment in diabetic mice by repairingdamaged neurons and astrocytes ( 100). In another study, AD-MSC-EXOs were found to have a signi ﬁcant mitigatory effecton T1MD by increasing the expression of anti-in ﬂammatory
factors (e.g., IL-10), and the population of Tregs that areequipped to suppress the immune response, preventingimmune overactivation and autoimmune damage ( 101). Inaddition, the results of the study by Shigemoto-kuroda et al.also con ﬁrmed that MSC-EVs could inhibit islet in ﬂammation,signiﬁcantly increasing the plasma insulin levels, and effectivelydelaying the occurrence of T1DM in mice ( 64). These resultssuggested that MSC-EVs have great potential as a cellulartherapy for the prevention of T1DM.4.4 UveitisUveitis is the leading cause of visual disability worldwide. Uveitiscan be divided into three categories according to etiology: 1)infectious uveitis; 2) non-infectious uveitis; and 3) masqueradeuveitis, of which non-infectious uveitis is believed to be caused byautoimmunity, and EAU is used as a mouse model ( 102).
Traditional immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., corticosteroids) andnovel biological agents have been shown to be effective for thetreatment of uveitis; however, side effects and unknown long-termsafety often limit the use of these drugs ( 103). A large number ofexperimental results have suggested that MSC-EXOs have apositive effect on in ﬂammatory eye disease. EAU mice that donot MSC-EXOs therapy have severely damaged retinalphotoreceptors and the in ﬁltration of in ﬂammatory cells,whereas EAU mice with exosomes injected through tail veindisplayed eyes similar to that of normal mouse retinas, withalmost no structural damage and in ﬂammatory in ﬁltration ( 64).Compared with EAU mice treated with PBS, mice treated withMSC-EXOs exhibited a signi ﬁcant decrease in CD3+T cellsinﬁltrating the retina and a decrease in the number ofmacrophages migrating to the retina ( 53). In addition, Th1 andTh17 cells represent importa nt pathogenic factors in the
development of EAU disease. Flow cytometry results of thecervical draining lymph nodes (CLNs) showed that the numberof IFN- g+CD4+cells (Th1) and IL-17+CD4+cells (Th17) in EAUmice treated with MSC-EXOs was signi ﬁcantly lower than that inthe PBS-treated mice ( 64). The above results indicate that MSC-EXOs can inhibit the development of EAU by inhibiting Th1 andTh17 cells. Part of the immunomodulatory function of MSCs onEAU is to induce the transformation of CD4+T cells into antigen-speci ﬁcC D 4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs by secreting TGF- bin aparacrine manner ( 104). In another study, MSC-EVs alleviatedEAU by directly inhibiting the development of Th1 and Th17 cellsrather than inducing Tregs to inhibit T cell proliferation ( 64).Although there may be some differences between MSC-EVs andMSCs in various immunomodulatory pathways, the treatment ofEAU using MSC-EVs also represents a potential new method.4.5 Rheumatoid Arthritis
4.5 Rheumatoid ArthritisRA is a chronic in ﬂammatory disease characterized by synovialhyperplasia and immune cell in ﬁltration, leading to jointdestruction ( 105,106). The microvesicles derived from BM-MSCs carry the regulatory molecules that exist in the mothercell, including PD-L1, GAL-1, and TGF- b1(76). As a PD-1
destruction ( 105,106). The microvesicles derived from BM-MSCs carry the regulatory molecules that exist in the mothercell, including PD-L1, GAL-1, and TGF- b1(76). As a PD-1receptor, PD-L1 plays a key role in regulating the developmentof inducible T regulatory cells (iTregs) ( 107). In addition, GAL-1 isan endogenous lectin that has been shown to induce growth arrestand the apoptosis of activated T cells, as well as theimmunoregulation mediated by regulatory T cells ( 108,109).Researchers found that the injection of co-gene DBA/1ﬁbroblasts secreting GAL-1 inhibited the progression of arthritisthrough T cell apoptosis in collagen-induced arthritis ( 110).Moreover, exosomal miRNA also plays an important role inalleviating the development of RA ( 111). For example, MSC-derived miRNA-150-5p-expressing exosomes decreased themigration and invasion in RA ﬁbroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS)
and downregulated tube formation in HUVECs by targetingMMP14 and VEGF ( 112). In 2020, researchers found that BM-MSCs-secreted exosomal miRNA-320a and miRNA-192-5p alsoacted on FLS, reducing in ﬂammatory response and alleviating theprogression of RA ( 113,114). Despite the pathogenic role of B cellsin RA, recent studies have demonstrated the therapeutic effect ofMSC-EXOs viaexpanding Bregs ( 48,115). BM-MSC-EXOs-treated CIA mice exhibited a lower disease incidence anddeceased clinical score, accompanied by reduced levels of serumauto-antibodies ( 115). Furthermore, such phenomena wasassociated with decreased plasmablast differentiation and thegeneration of Bregs ( 48). Interestingly, similar therapeutic effectshave been revealed in osteoarthritis (OA). The lncRNA KLF3-AS1was signi ﬁcantly enriched in MSC-EXOs, which promotedcartilage repair and chondrocyte proliferation in OA rat models(116). In addition, in a model of porcine synovitis induced by
bovine serum albumin, the intraarticular injection of BM-MSC-EVs into pigs had an anti-in ﬂammatory effect, with a reducednumber of synovial lymphocytes and down-regulated level ofTNF- atranscription ( 117). These results provide evidence for arole of MSC-EVs for the treatment of in ﬂammatory diseases (e.g.,arthritis). MSC-EVs provide novel insight into the treatment ofRA, which may lead to new therapeutic opportunities andstrategies for RA.4.6 In ﬂammatory Bowel DiseaseIBD is a chronic, nonspeci ﬁc, relapsing in ﬂammatorygastrointestinal disease a ssociated with mucosal immunesystem disorders and gastrointestinal injury. IBD, whichprimarily includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn ’s disease(CD), has become a global disease with an increasing incidence(118). Studies of this disease have mainly used DSS and 2,4,6-
trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) to induce IBD in mousemodels ( 119). Existing drugs to treat IBD are still very limited,Shen et al. Effects of MSC-EXOS on AIDFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 749192 9
Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop safe and effectivetreatments for IBD ( 120). At present, several studies have shownthat MSC-EXOs/exosome components have potential functionsin the development of IBD and can serve as potential targets forthe diagnosis and treatment of IBD. In a model of IBD inducedby DSS, hUC-MSC-EXOs treatment decreased the in ﬁltration ofmacrophages in colon tissue and inhibited the expression of IL-7(121). hUC-MSC-EXOs also inhibited neddylation and alleviatedIBD by miR-326 ( 122). Another study also showed that exosomalmiRNA of MSCs, such us miR-146a, downregulated TNFreceptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) expression, inhibited pro-inﬂammatory cytokine and enhanced the expression of IL-10(123).Moreover, tumor necrosis factor- astimulated gene 6
(TSG-6), as detected by hUC-MSC-EXOs, regulated theimmune response of Th2 and Th17 cells in mesenteric lymphnodes (MLN), down-regulated the levels of pro-in ﬂammatorycytokines in colon tissue, and up-regulated the levels of anti-inﬂammatory cytokines to protect the intestinal barrier ( 119).Other tissue-derived MSC-EXOs showed similar ef ﬁcacy to thatof hUC-MSC-EXOs in the treatment of DSS induced IBD. OE-MSC-EXOs signi ﬁcantly improved the severity of experimentalcolitis in mice primarily by modulating the immune response ofTh-cells, including a signi ﬁcant reduction in Th1/Th17 subsetsand an increase in Treg cells ( 77). Neda Heidari et al. reportedthat AD-MSC-EXOs therapy could restore the percentage ofTreg in the spleen to a baseline level similar to that in normalmice and improved in ﬂammation in DSS induced acute colitis(124). Furthermore, metalloth ionein-2 in hBM-MSC-EXOsinhibited in ﬂammatory responses, polarized M2b macrophages,
and maintained intestinal barrier integrity ( 125). With thefurther research on exosomes, exosomal-structure design ofnovel drugs may provide new insights for IBD.5 CONCLUSION AND PROSPECTSThe treatment of autoimmune diseases is challenging and thereis currently no effective cure. In this review, we discussed theregulatory role of MSC-EXOs on immune cells and the newprogress of MSC-EXOs in the treatment of autoimmune diseases,suggesting that MSC-EXOs may be a new cell-free drug for thetreatment of autoimmune diseases.In view of the therapeutic potential of MSC-EXOs inpreclinical studies, there are currently 19 clinical trials lookingat its application in a variety of diseases (Available online: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/). Although encouraging results have beenachieved with MSC-EXOs, several uncharted territories remainto be explored before MSC-EXOs can be used as drug vectors for
clinical use. First, although it has been reported that clinical-grade exosomes can be produced using good manufacturingtechniques and standard operating procedures, large-scaleproduction of exosomes for clinical use remains to be explored(126). Second, support materials can be used to maximize thetherapeutic power of MSC-EXOs. In recent years, hydrogel hasattracted much attention amon g biocompatible auxiliarymaterials. In the experimental model of ischemia, the retentiontime of MSC-EXOs with an injectable hydrogel was prolonged,which enhanced the therapeutic effect of exosomes ( 127). In theexperiment of preventing hyperplastic scar in rabbit ear model,adipose-derived stem cell conditioned Medium (ADSC-CM) wascombined with polysacchari de hydrogel to prolong thetherapeutic effect of cytokines ( 128). Third, in order to ensure
the safety of patients treated with MSC-EXOs, the route and doseof exosomes must be explored. At present, the main route ofadministration in clinical studies is intravenous infusion.However, aerosol inhalation of MSC-EXOs was used in clinicaltrials to explore the ef ﬁcacy of MSC-EXOs in severe pulmonarydiseases (Clinical Trials. Gov Identi ﬁer: NCT04313647). Inaddition, the clinical trial assessing the safety and ef ﬁcacy of
trials to explore the ef ﬁcacy of MSC-EXOs in severe pulmonarydiseases (Clinical Trials. Gov Identi ﬁer: NCT04313647). Inaddition, the clinical trial assessing the safety and ef ﬁcacy ofMSC-EXOs in Patients with Alzheimer ’s disease was conductedwith nasal drip (ClinicalTrials.gov Identi ﬁer: NCT04388982).Therefore, the route of exosome administration needs to bedetermined according to the actual situation of the disease. Inaddition, clinical trials need to monitor patients treated withMSC-EXOs in real time to ensure that the smallest dose is mosteffective. Therefore, future work should focus on thecombination of basic research on MSC-EXOs with emergingtechnologies to bring new breakthroughs for the treatment ofautoimmune diseases.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSZS, WH, and JL drafted and revised the manuscript.
