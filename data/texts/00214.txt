REVIEWMenopause and the Skin: Old Favorites and NewInnovations in Cosmeceuticals for Estrogen-DeﬁcientSkinEdwin D. Lephart .Frederick NaftolinReceived: October 5, 2020 / Published online: November 26, 2020/C211The Author(s) 2020ABSTRACTEstrogen is a pivotal signaling molecule; itsproduction is regulated by the expression of thearomatase (CYP19A1) gene from ovarian andperipheral tissue sites, and it is transmitted viaestrogen receptors to inﬂuence many importantbiological functions. However, the narrative forthis overview focuses on the decline of 17 b-estradiol levels from ovarian sites after meno-pause. This estrogen-deﬁcient condition isassociated with a dramatic reduction in skinhealth and wellness by negatively impactingdermal cellular and homeostatic mechanisms,as well as other important biological functions.The changes include loss of collagen, elastin,ﬁbroblast function, vascularity, and increasedmatrix metalloproteinase(s) enzymatic activi-
ties, resulting in cellular and extracellulardegradation that leads to dryness, wrinkles,atrophy, impaired wound healing/barrier func-tion, decreased antioxidant capacity [i.e.,defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS)and oxidative stress], decreased attractivenessand psychological health, and increased per-ception of aging. While topical estrogen mayreverse these changes, the effects of today’s low-dose systemic hormone treatments are not wellestablished, raising the need for more concen-trated local administration of hormones ornewer cosmeceutical agents such as selectiveestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), includ-ing phytoestrogens that have become majoractive ingredients for skin care products, espe-cially when addressing estrogen-deﬁcient skin.Two example compounds are presented, ananalog of resveratrol (i.e., 40-acetoxy resveratrol)and the isoﬂavonoid equol, both of which areinvolved in a variety of biochemical/molecular

even psychological health. Women withmenopausal skin changes seek cosmetic andmedical treatments that enhance their self-per-ception and inhibit skin aging, particularly inexposed areas (face, neck, and hands). It iswidely accepted that traditional treatmentssuch as local hormone treatment are effective inreversing (estrogen-deﬁcient) aging skin deteri-oration. But, the uncertainly of the effects oflong-term systemic menopausal treatment and,more recently, aversion to systemic hormoneshas led to newer therapeutic agents that cansend estrogen’s important skin-health signalsvia selective estrogen receptor modulators(SERMs) other than estrogen itself. Many plant-derived compounds (phytoestrogens) that con-tain estrogen-agonist SERMs now play majorroles in treatments for aging and estrogen-deﬁ-cient skin. The targets are the estrogen receptorbeta molecules that are abundant in skin (ker-atinocytes/ﬁbroblasts). The variation in effect

While several botanicals are men-tioned in this overview, two promising cosme-ceuticals are examined, an analog of resveratrol[40-acetoxy resveratrol (4AR)], which enjoys ahigh public proﬁle in the health arena, and theisoﬂavonoid compound equol.

Women with estrogen-deﬁcient skinassociated with menopause seek cosmeticand medical treatments to improvedermal health and physical characteristicsto enhance their self-perception andinhibit skin aging.Traditional treatments, such as low-dosemenopausal hormone treatment (MHT),are adequate to marginal in reversingestrogen-deﬁcient skin. This has led tonewer therapeutic agents that can sendestrogen’s important signal in a speciﬁcpositive manner via selective estrogenreceptor modulators (SERMs). Many plant-derived compounds (phytoestrogens)have this SERM characteristic and nowplay a major role as cosmeceuticals in theskin care industry.Reviewed here are two phytoestrogen/botanicals, namely an analog ofresveratrol [40-acetoxy resveratrol (4AR)]and a newer isoﬂavonoid compound,equol. Both are cosmeceuticals that havepeer-reviewed in vitro and novel clinicalstudy results that support theimprovement of estrogen-deﬁcient skin.DIGITAL FEATURES

There are two othermajor natural estrogens in the circulation, estroneand estriol (primarily during pregnancy) [ 1,5].While estrogens widely inﬂuence many
While estrogens widely inﬂuence manyimportant functions such as homeostaticactions, cell proliferation and death, liverprotein expression, lipid metabolism, energybalance, glucose metabolism, immune and car-diovascular regulation, gonadotrophin feedbackand gametogenesis, brain-neuronal develop-ment/memory processing and repair/neurode-generation, bone growth, and others, thisreview is focused on estrogen and dermalhealth, especially in estrogen-deﬁcient skin inwomen [ 1–6].ESTROGEN BIOSYNTHESIS IN SKINT h ee n z y m er e s p o n s i b l ef o re s t r o g e np r o d u c t i o nis encoded by the aromat ase cytochrome P450(CYP19A1) gene, which converts C19 androgensto C18 estrogens [ 3,4]. This enzyme has a dualeffect: (1) the removal of the androgen moleculeor the ‘‘detoxiﬁcation of androgens by aromatase’’by the removal of one carbon and (2) the pro-d u c t i o no ft h ee s t r o g e nm o l e c u l e st h a ta r e ,m o l efor mole, 100 to 1,000 times more biologically
active or potent compared with their parentandrogens [ 3,4]. So testosterone, through themore abundant androgen metabolic pathway, isreduced by the 5 a-reductase enzyme to 5 a-dihy-drotestosterone (5 a-DHT), which is known toinhibit estrogen actions such as wound healingand skin repair [ 6–9].Skin estrogen biosynthesis has been reportedin keratinocytes, melanocytes, and ﬁbroblasts[10–13]. Also, estrogen induces the structuralprotein ezrin that enables the intercellularbridges that furnish epidermal integrity [ 14],induces the hydrophilic glycosaminoglycanhyaluran that underlies skin thickness andopacity, induces elastin which gives the skin itsresilience to deformation, and induces theexpression of several types of collagens that arethe basis of the mass of the dermis [ 14].ESTROGEN PRODUCTION, LEVELSIN WOMEN: EFFECTS ON SKINAt puberty, the developing ovarian folliclesbegin secreting estrogens.

This is becauseof its interaction characteristics with estrogenDermatol Ther (Heidelb) (2021) 11:53–69 55
receptors. Estriol has little estrogen agonistactivity for the same reason [ 4,15]. During theadult reproductive period, overall estrogenlevels originating from the ovaries peak in thelate 20s [ 15] (Fig. 1). Skin collagen and elastinpeak around 30 years of age, which correspondswith the peak in estrogen production [ 16]. Inthis regard, several reports suggest positive cor-relations between circulating estrogen levelsand: (a) perceived age, (b) attractiveness, (c) en-hanced skin health, and (d) facial coloration inwomen [ 17]. There are several reviews on theimportance of estrogen and skin [ 13,17–21],only the main points will be noted here.As human beings age, the ﬁrst signs of der-mal aging begins around 30 years of age whenestrogen levels begin to decline, the skin thins,dries, wrinkles, becomes pigmented unevenly[and with continued age liver spots (solarlentigines) form], and wound healing is delayed[13,17–23]. Speciﬁcally, the appearance of
[13,17–23]. Speciﬁcally, the appearance ofwrinkles around the eyes and mouth, and frownlines along the forehead are seen with unevenskin color and a general loss of skin tone (paleappearance) [ 16,21–23]. Sagging skin and thinskin are due to the loss of deﬁnition/abundanceof the underlying collagen and especially theelastin ﬁbers in the dermal layer that providethe full, robust, and elastic recoil properties ofyouthful skin associated with normal premen-strual estrogen levels, see below [ 13,17–23].Estrogen also enhances moisture/hydration (viahyaluronic acid, mucopolysaccharides, andsebum production) where skin turgor, dermalthickness, and keratinocyte and ﬁbroblast pro-liferation is increased [ 13,17–21]. Additionalpositive inﬂuences of estrogen includeincreased cellular viability and extracellularmatrix components, such as ﬁbrillin and tissueinhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP)and inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases
and inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases(MMPs) [ 13,17–21], counteracting radical oxy-gen species (ROS) and oxidative stress (OS) viaits antioxidant properties, and ﬁnally activatingnuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRf2)that leads to the increased expression of otherantioxidants and detoxifying enzymes [ 24–31].Fig. 1 Approximate production of estrogens (proﬁle) inwomen with age. Estrogen levels peak in the late 20s.Estrogen levels during perimenopause ﬂuctuate greatlyaround a normal range until menopause, when no moreresponsive follicles are available. In the USA, most womenexperience menopause from 40 to 58 years of age, with theaverage at 51 years of age (see red rectangular bar above thex-axis). In postmenopausal women, all the estrogenproduction is derived from peripheral tissues, primarilyfrom adipose tissue [ 15]. Estrogen levels (17 b-estradiol and
estrone) in the reproductive interval (i.e., approximately12–40 years of age) and changes in these levels during theperimenopause and postmenopausal intervals have beenreported in detail elsewhere [ 17]56 Dermatol Ther (Heidelb) (2021) 11:53–69
THE MENOPAUSE AND ESTROGEN-DEFICIENT SKINThere are several reviews that cover the impor-tance of estrogen-deﬁcient skin duringpostmenopause [ 17–21,23,32–35], only themain basic endocrine, skin biology, and someclinical points will be noted here (see Table 1).Menopause is a period of particular interestregarding skin biology and treatment.

‘‘menopause’’ marks a milestone in agingwomen—1 year of no menstrual periods [ 36].The cause is the failure of ovarian follicles toproduce sufﬁcient estrogen to stimulate thegrowth of the endometrium. While menopausecan occur prematurely in women as a result ofsystemic or ovarian disease, or as the result ofovarian ablation, most attention is focused onskin changes in women who, from the age ofabout 45 years, begin to undergo high and lowerratic swings of estrogen as their gonadotropin-responsive ovarian follicles become exhausted[15,17].By age 45–55 (the average of menopause inthe USA is 51 [ 36]), all responsive follicles aregone and there ensues a decades-long period inwhich the main source of estrogens is localformation (peripheral conversion) of androgenssecreted by the ovarian stroma and adrenalglands [ 15,17]. The degree of skin atrophypresent at a speciﬁc time depends on the pre-vious exposure to estrogen, the amount of local
vious exposure to estrogen, the amount of localestrogen produced by the skin and subcuta-neous fat, and effects of aging [ 15,37].Regardless of the above, few menopausalwomen escape skin atrophy [ 33]. The mostobvious places that this is noticeable is in areasthat have not been shaded from actinic rays andwhere an upright posture facilitates gravity-fedsagging; the face, neck, and forearms-hands[22,23,33]. A simple test of the extent of thesechanges is performed by gently grasping theskin on the back of the hand, pulling it upwardand observing when the skin is released howquickly the fold falls back to its original shape.In postmenopausal women the fold may take3–4 times as long to reconstitute itself as is thecase in premenopausal women [ 38,39]. This isdue to the lack of hydrophilic glycosaminogly-cans (GAGs) and proteoglycans (PGs) [ 40,41],low hydration of the dermis [ 18–20,32–35], thelack of a tight association between epidermis,
lack of a tight association between epidermis,dermis, and sub dermis [ 17,18,22,23] causedby decreased expression of collagen and elastin[17,18,21].Also, collagen to collagen cross-linking isimportant where they provide strength andstability, while excessive or nonspeciﬁc cross-links create stiffness and lack of recoil, which isa component of wrinkle formation, along with areduction in muscle mass, skin thickness, anddehydration of the stratum corneum [ 41–43].Notably, since hyaluran is plentiful during thepremenopausal period, it may be that the col-lagen in skin is always cycling with hyaluran-spread collagen ﬁbrils, making available estro-gen-induced collagenase and other proteases.This is the case in the uterine cervix [ 44].In addition to the above, the skin of meno-pausal women, particularly that of women whoare many years postmenopausal is fragile toabrasion. This is related to the decrease inestrogen-induced ezrin in the epidermis. Ezrin is
estrogen-induced ezrin in the epidermis. Ezrin isresponsible for the interlinking of epidermalcells via ‘‘intercellular bridges’’ that maintainthe integrity against the elements of the epi-dermis layer of the skin [ 14,45].Throughout the dermis and sub dermis,there is vascular fragility that may result inleakage of blood from the microvascular system.While this has not been studied, it is possiblethat this is related to the lack of estrogen-de-pendent vascular maintenance [ 46,47].All-in-all, the above changes during themenopause are difﬁcult to hide and become aserious cosmetic issue [ 48].ESTROGEN RECEPTORS AND THEIRACTION IN SKINThe classical estrogen receptors (ER), ER a, andERb, are members of the superfamily of nuclearhormone receptors [ 5,12,17]. Speciﬁcally,human ER bis homologous to ER a, particularlyin the DNA-binding domain (97% amino acididentity) but share little homology in the otherdomains [ 5,12,17]. Based upon the dissimilar
domains [ 5,12,17]. Based upon the dissimilaramino acid homology in the ligand-bindingregion, one may predict 17 b-estradiol woulddisplay different afﬁnities for the ERs, but sur-prisingly, 17 b-estradiol has almost equal highafﬁnity for ER awith a Kd= 0.13 nmol/L and for
display different afﬁnities for the ERs, but sur-prisingly, 17 b-estradiol has almost equal highafﬁnity for ER awith a Kd= 0.13 nmol/L and forERbwith a Kd= 0.15 nmol/L [ 5,12,17,34].There is tissue-speciﬁc expression in humans ofthe ERs, where ER bis more widely expressed inskin compared with ER a, and this is especiallythe case in the human scalp [ 10–12,17,21]. ERaactivation is a major factor in reproductivecancers (e.g. breast and prostate), whereas ER b58 Dermatol Ther (Heidelb) (2021) 11:53–69
activation appears to be chemoprotective[34,49]. Finally, ER bactivation has been shownto promote wound healing, independent ofestrogen’s anti-inﬂammatory properties [ 50].Thus, selective estrogen receptor modulators(SERM’s) at ERs have proven to provide skinbeneﬁts.[ 21,34,35,49,51,52].It is now apparent that many cells express anongenomic, G-protein-coupled seven-trans-membrane ER termed GPER, also known asGPER1 or GPR30, that directly triggers cellularsignaling cascades [ 5,12,17]. Recently, it hasbeen shown that GPER activation protectsagainst epithelial barrier disruption by Staphy-lococcus aureus a-toxin [ 53].Finally, multiple studies have established thepresence of mitochondrial ERs, which suggeststhat estrogen plays a role in regulating cellularbioenergetics [ 48,54,55]. While not yet studiedin skin, this estrogen regulatory mechanismmay be important for good dermal health.TRADITIONAL ESTROGEN-BASEDSYSTEMIC AND TOPICALTREATMENTS
SYSTEMIC AND TOPICALTREATMENTSStarting in the 1940’s, treatment of menopausalwomen with estrogenic preparations becamepopular for symptoms such as hot ﬂushes [ 56].This menopausal hormone treatment (MHT)was later augmented with the addition of aprogestin to avoid the development ofendometrial hyperplasia or cancer. While thehormones were primarily administered orally,they also were given by sub-cutaneous implantsand by topically applied gels [ 56] The chiefestrogen preparation used in the US remains anequine urinary extract of mixed human andequine hormonal compounds termed conju-gated equine estrogen (CEE) or Premarin/C211[17,56].The most common progestin compoundedwith CEE is medroxyprogesterone acetate(MPA), although recent studies have incrimi-nated MPA in many adverse effects such asnausea, bloating, headache, changes inappetite, weight gain, tiredness, swelling, acne,hot ﬂashes, breast tenderness [ 57], and should
hot ﬂashes, breast tenderness [ 57], and shouldbe avoided in favor of nonsynthetic progestinssuch as progesterone or SERMs that do notactivate the endometrium [ 21,51].In the intervening years since the inaugura-tion of MHT, many pharmaceutical com-poundings have appeared, including 17 b-estradiol and progesterone. The latter requiredthe development of micronized forms to avoidintestinal metabolism [ 58]. Both CEE andestradiol have been available in gel/creamforms.In addition to relief of menopausal symp-toms, maintenance of bone and psychologicalhealth, there has been an interest in the effectof these ‘‘classical’’ forms of MHT on the skin.While there are many anecdotal and open labelstudies of the effects of these various forms ofMHT on skin health that showed positive effectson skin thickness [ 18,19], wrinkles [ 59], andother measures [ 17,23,33], randomized, blin-ded prospective trials are few, indeed. Most ofthe studies on the effects of estrogen on skin
date from the time when the dosage of theestrogenic component of MHT was as much asten times the amount in present day treatment.Furthermore, through all the hormones andskin literature, there is continued qualiﬁcationof studies and results because of the large andusually unmeasured or uncontrolled effects ofexposure to the elements, smoking, race, andaging [ 17,23,60–62].Formal evaluations of the effect of thesevariables are found in the literature on MHTand skin cancer. These studies show that race—likely expressed as skin pigmentation—, expo-sure, smoking, and aging are confoundingvariables with more inﬂuence on the skin thanMHT [ 63].While several studies, including a study byWolff, Narayan and Taylor in 2005 [ 64], havesuggested that MHT improves aging skin[17–21,34,35], at present, there is only oneprospective randomized controlled trial of theeffects of oral or transdermal MHT comparedwith placebo. This is the Kronos Early Estrogen

skin wrinkles and rigidity in women within 3years of menopause who received treatment orplacebo for 4 years. We show the most impor-tant illustration (Fig. 2) from this clinical studyas reported by Owens, et al. [ 65].The conclusion of this study was that racewas the strongest predictor of the advancementof skin aging in the 4 years following meno-pause where Black women had the lowestwrinkle scores and signiﬁcantly reduced facialrigidity compared with White women [ 65].Also, MHT does not appear to affect skin wrin-kles or rigidity at most facial locations [ 65].Notably, in contrast, earlier studies showedthat long-term hormonal therapy can indeedprevent skin aging in women [ 17–21,64]. Thismay not be surprising, as estrogen plays manyimportant roles in skin cells and glands such askeratinocytes, Langerhans cells, melanocytes,sebaceous glands, and ﬁbroblasts, and decreasedestrogen levels results in decreased capillaryblood ﬂow velocity to the skin [ 66]. However, as
noted by Owen et al. [ 65] ‘‘previous ﬁndingsmay have been confounded by indication andselection bias that may account for the differ-ences seen in earlier studies that were non-prospective, non-randomized, non-double-blind.’’ Also, it is possible that the KEEPS datafrom the Owen study in 2016 [ 65] may havebeen ‘‘underpowered to detect a difference withMHT, or the relative dose was not potentenough, or that a different period of treatmentwould have led to decreased wrinkles and anobjective difference in skin wrinkle scores.’’The recent clinical trials appropriately uselower doses than was common in the last cen-tury, meaning these results may be more rele-vant than earlier studies. However, with theintroduction of different compoundings anddoses of MHT, more prospective clinical trialsare greatly needed.Fig. 2 Hormone effects on skin vary by race.

IS ESTROGEN TREATMENT SAFE?Over the last two decades, there has been achange in the attitudes of both professionalsand the public regarding the medical uses ofestrogen. This is due to a misapprehension ofthe effects of MHT on menopausal women. In2002, the NIH stopped the estrogen-containingarms of a large randomized trial of menopausaltreatments [ 67,68]. The misapprehension wasdue to the inclusion in the Women’s HealthInitiative (WHI) of [10-year postmenopausalwomen with age-related risk factors for cardio-vascular complications. This resulted in anexcess of venous thromboembolism amongsubjects older than 59 years at the time ofcommencement of the trial with MHT. By thetime that this error was noticed, along with thelack of adverse effects on perimenopausalwomen less than 60, the administration ofestrogen-containing MHT had fallen below 25%compared with previous years, and many doc-tors were aggressively opposing MHT. Further-more, with the loss of marketable product,
more, with the loss of marketable product,pharmaceutical manufacturers discontinueddevelopment and testing of estrogen-contain-ing products. However, it is clear that contem-porary MHT started in healthy women beforethey have reached 6–10 years past the meno-pause is free of excess cardiovascular complica-tions [ 69]. MHT use is an individual issue for thewoman and her caregiver. This applies towomen with histories of successfully treatedestrogen-sensitive lesions [ 70].ESTROGEN-ONLY TREATMENTFOR SKIN HEALTHSince menopause is linked to the failure ofovarian function, the presence of the uterus isnot relevant to issues regarding menopause.That being noted, surgical removal of the uterusfor gynecological disease or cancer often isaccompanied by removal of the ovaries. Inthose cases, women of premenopausal ageundergo premature menopause and may betreated with MHT for hot ﬂushes. In these cases,
treated with MHT for hot ﬂushes. In these cases,there is no need for the addition of progestin toprotect against endometrial growth. The typesof estrogen are the same as described regardingMHT for menopausal hot ﬂushes, etc. There areno studies on the skin of premature menopausalwomen taking estrogen. At the time of writing,it is safe to consider estrogen alone treatment(ET) to be comparable to MHT as regards dermalhealth [ 19,71].TOPICALLY APPLIED HORMONETREATMENT OF SKINAlthough the skin has a protective epidermallayer, fat soluble molecules, such as steroidhormones, are well absorbed and bound byhormone receptors in the epidermis, dermis,and subdermis. Accordingly, preparations suchas CEE creams have been available for decades.More recently, gels and hormone-eluting silas-tic patches are available and may be utilized tomaintain or repair aging skin. In general, thereis plentiful evidence of the positive effects oflocally applied estrogen and other SERMs
locally applied estrogen and other SERMs[19,21,23,51,59,72]. However, in practice, theresults of the use of topical estrogen remainssubject to the effects of the overarching non-dermatologic factors; race, actinic exposure,smoking, and aging.Finally, the use of topical gels, creams, andpatches raises the possibilities of adverse effectsof high dose exposure. Since the role of estrogenin the development of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers seems to be minimal[67,69–71], the main issue is possible systemicoverdose via topical administration. This is anunstudied issue. Perhaps the most troublingpossible generator of adverse consequences isthe effect of aging on the cardiovascular statusof women. The WHI has amply shown theincidence of intravascular thrombosis and itsaccompanying effects—cardiovascular episodesand stroke must be kept in mind—for women10 years or more past the menopause should
10 years or more past the menopause shouldnot be exposed to estrogen without the super-vision of a physician [ 73,74].Dermatol Ther (Heidelb) (2021) 11:53–69 61
BIOIDENTICAL HORMONESThe term ‘‘bioidentical hormone’’ technicallyrefers to a compound with the same molecularstructure as a hormone that is endogenouslyproduced (e.g., 17 b-estradiol). However, inpopular culture, the term refers to the use ofcustom-compounded multihormone regimens(pills, gels, sublingual tablets, or suppositories)with dose adjustments based upon serial hor-mone monitoring. The hormones most-com-monly compounded are estradiol, estrone,estriol, progesterone, testosterone, and dehy-droepiandrosterone (DHEA) [ 75,76].The use of carefully documented bioidenticalhormone therapy has been recently reviewedand presented to be effective and safe in post-menopausal women for dermal care, especiallyfor anti-aging of the skin [ 77], however, there isa lack of uniformity in the various formulationsthat can be compounded, and attention shouldbe exercised under careful guidance by alicensed health professional.COSMECEUTICALSFOR ESTROGEN-DEFICIENT SKIN

The termcosmeceutical was ﬁrst coined by Dr. AlbertKligman in 1984 to describe topical productsthat afford both cosmetic and therapeutic ben-eﬁts [ 79]. The pharmaceutical claims, in gen-eral, are subject to safety and efﬁcacy regulationby the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).However, the FDA does not recognize the des-ignation ‘‘cosmeceuticals’’ and instead considerscosmeceutical products as cosmetics. One of thegreatest sources of new cosmeceutical ingredi-ents comes from the plant kingdom[34,35,80,81]. Plants are rich in antioxidantsbecause they must survive continual ultravioletradiation exposure. Botanicals are also thoughtto be safe, which meets the FDA’s criteria ofsubstances that can be put into topical andover-the-counter formulations. Flowers, seeds,stems, leaves, roots, twigs, and fruits like berries,
grapes, etc. from all over the world are beingincorporated into cosmeceuticals [ 49,62]. Inchoosing an effective cosmeceutical(s) regimen,it is critical to match patients and their skinneeds with the appropriate active ingredients.In this regard, many studies have examinedphytochemicals of the polyphenolic class thatare also known as phytoestrogens, which act asSERMs where many possess ER b-agonist prop-erties [ 7,49,51,80,81]. Notably, topical iso-ﬂavones effects on the skin in postmenopausalwomen have been reviewed [ 34]. Creams, gels,and lotions containing phytoestrogens andisoﬂavones or genistein alone in 12–24 weekclinical studies showed improvement in skindryness, thickness, facial wrinkles, ﬁbroblastviability, increased hyaluronic acid levels, andtype I and III collagen production [ 34]. In thesestudies, no signiﬁcant adverse effects weredetected after topical usage of the formulationsusing the phytochemical active ingredients.
using the phytochemical active ingredients.The anti-aging properties of the well-knownresveratrol compound that can be derived fromgrapes has been available for over a decade andreviewed [ 49,82–84]. More recent studies reportthe skin beneﬁts of resveratrol which includeanti-inﬂammatory, antioxidant properties thatprotect against UV radiation, oxidative stress byNrf2 activation by reducing the expression ofactivator protein 1 (AP-1) and NF-kB factors,proliferation of ﬁbroblasts to increase collagen(types I, II, and III), inhibition of melanogene-sis, and activation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT 1, the anti-aging factor) [ 49,81–83]. Importantly, NF-kBsignaling has been reviewed, emphasizing howfree radicals activate this key factor involved inskin aging [ 85].To increase the effectiveness of resveratrol intopical skin applications, due to the activity ofphase I and phase II enzymes in skin such ascytochrome P450, esterases, and transferases,
cytochrome P450, esterases, and transferases,respectively [ 86,87], resveratrol analogs havebeen generated and tested [ 49,88]. For instance,a report examined the resveratrol analog,
cytochrome P450, esterases, and transferases,respectively [ 86,87], resveratrol analogs havebeen generated and tested [ 49,88]. For instance,a report examined the resveratrol analog,resveratrol triacetate that demonstratedincreased stability, can lighten human skinwithout skin irritation [ 88], and is well-knownthat esterase and dehydrogenase activity playsan important role in the skin metabolism ofretinyl palmitate to retinol (vitamin A) duringpercutaneous absorption [ 89].62 Dermatol Ther (Heidelb) (2021) 11:53–69
Thus, one of our laboratories tested severalresveratrol analogs in preliminary studies todetermine whether human skin beneﬁts wereobtainable, and the most potent was 40-acetoxyresveratrol (4AR) [ 49,90] where via human geneexpression analysis of this polyphenolic com-pound increased: (a) gene expression of theanti-aging factor, SIRT 1 by over 3.3-fold,extracellular matrix proteins collagen III, IV,elastin and tissue inhibitors of metallopro-teinases (TIMP 1), (b) the anti-oxidants, CAT,lysyl oxidase (LOX), superoxide dismutase (SOD1, 2), metallothioneins (MT1H, MT1H), (c) skinaging biomarkers ﬁbrillin (FBN1), laminin(LAMB1), proliferating cell nuclear antigen(PCNA), and (d) skin growth factors [heparin-bind EGF-growth factor (HBEGF), insulin-likegrowth factor 1 (IGF1), nerve growth factor(NGF), and transforming growth factor (TGF)].4AR also decreased gene expression of inﬂam-matory and skin-aging molecules [interleukin(IL-1, IL-6, IL-8), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2),
(IL-1, IL-6, IL-8), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2),tumor necrosis factor receptor super family(TNFRSF)] and the S100 calcium binding pro-teins A8, A9, suggesting that 4AR 2 has poten-tial for topical treatment and prevention ofdermal aging, especially in estrogen-deﬁcientskin. In general, the human skin gene analysisresults for 4AR displayed signiﬁcantly greaterefﬁcacy compared with all-trans resveratrol [ 49].Subsequently, 4AR was tested in a singlecenter clinical study (by an independent com-pany) that examined 36 female subjects for12 weeks, the demographics and results of theself-assessment questionnaire are shown inTable 2[91]. Across eight skin attributes (fromﬁrmness to hydration) the subjects reportedsigniﬁcant improvements after 12 weeks oftopical 4AR application, suggesting that thisresveratrol analog maybe effective in treatingestrogen-deﬁcient skin [ 91].In another study, one of our laboratories
In another study, one of our laboratoriesexamined the isoﬂavonoid compound, equol, arelatively new phytochemical used as an ingre-dient for human skin applications, which has apolyphenolic chemical structure found in plantand food sources [ 7,16,49]. It is also classiﬁedas a phytoestrogen, having selective estrogenreceptor modulator (SERM) characteristics thatyield an enhanced/sustained topical delivery upto 28 h into the dermal skin layers by binding toERbin keratinocytes [ 62,92], which inhibitsdermal aging and enhances facial attractiveness[7,16,49,62]. Additionally, it has been reportedin a double-blind study that oral supplementa-tion of equol on skin aging in postmenopausalwomen in Japan for 12 weeks of treatmentresulted in signiﬁcant reductions in wrinkles(crow’s feet) compared with the placebo group[93]. Subsequently, other investigators reportedthat topical equol after 8 weeks improvedstructural and molecular skin parameters
(roughness, texture, smoothness, ﬁrmness,elasticity, and decreased methylation andtelomere length in skin cells) [ 93]. Also, thewomen did not show a signiﬁcant difference intopically applied equol verses micro-encapsu-lated equol, suggesting the delivery was notenhanced by microencapsulation, conﬁrmingprior results of sustained topical delivery viapercutaneous dermal penetration [ 93,94]. Fromrecent human skin gene analysis studies,equol’s efﬁcacy was greater than astaxanthin forantioxidants, extracellular matrix integrity andbreakdown, growth factors and inﬂammatorybiomarkers, including the signiﬁcant stimula-tion of the anti-aging factor, SIRT 1 [ 95].Notably, equol has a chiral carbon, resultingin two isomers or mirror image molecules (R-equol and S-equol). Both equol isomers exhibitantioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory, skin protectant(against ROS/oxidative stress) and speciﬁcallyanti-androgen hormonal actions by bindingfree 5 a-dihydrotestosterone (5a-DHT) as a
free 5 a-dihydrotestosterone (5a-DHT) as aselective androgen modulator (SAM) andblocking the 5 a-reductase type I enzyme indermal cells to protect ﬁbroblast viability[7,16,49,62].In a clinical study, equol was tested in a
a-DHT) as aselective androgen modulator (SAM) andblocking the 5 a-reductase type I enzyme indermal cells to protect ﬁbroblast viability[7,16,49,62].In a clinical study, equol was tested in asingle-center investigation by an independentcompany that examined 59 female subjects for12 weeks, the demographics and results of theself-assessment questionnaire are shown inTable 2[96]. Across eight skin attributes (fromﬁrmness to hydration) the subjects reportedsigniﬁcant improvements after 12 weeks oftopical equol application, suggesting that thisisoﬂavonoid compound may be effective intreating estrogen-deﬁcient skin [ 96].Dermatol Ther (Heidelb) (2021) 11:53–69 63
When comparing the clinical parameters ofthe 4AR with the equol technology, resultsshowed that: (a) in general, the percentimprovement in the eight skin areas for bothtreatment were similar, (b) the slightly higherpercentages for some of the skin parameters forthe 4AR versus the equol technology may bedue to the difference in the number of post-menopausal women, where the equol study had20% more female subjects that were amenor-rheic for at least 3 years compared with the 4ARsubjects and, (c) the concentration of the 4ARtreatment was more than three times that of theequol treatment at 1.0% versus 0.3%, respec-tively. Therefore, 4AR and equol along withmany other botanicals may be considered asactive ingredients in cosmetic topical and oralapplications [ 34,49,79–81,97,98].CONCLUSIONSEstrogens play major roles in maintainingphysiological functions in the human body.Menopause represents an inﬂection point, afterwhich the skin undergoes conspicuous decline
in appearance and function. This is especiallytrue in exposed areas (face, neck, and hands)and carries messages of age-related decline.Women with estrogen-deﬁcient skin seek cos-metic and medical treatments to improve der-mal health and physical characteristics toTable 2 Self-Assessment Questionnaire analysis from randomized, single-center 12-week clinical studies comparing equol,40-acetoxy resveratrol (4AR)Efﬁcacy: percent improvement over baseline (parameters 1–8) Equol 4’ Acetoxy resveratrol1.

enhance their self-perception and inhibit skinaging, particularly in highly visible body areas.Early studies showed that traditional MHTprevents or reverses the deterioration of skinaging, however, later in 2016, one rigorousclinical study did not show that systemic treat-ments with estrogen in doses that treat meno-pausal symptoms and systemic deteriorationcan overcome the effects of actinic exposure,smoking, racial makeup, or aging on the skin.However, local applications of estrogenic com-pounds known as SERM’s have been shown torepair and avoid deterioration in the facial area.Many plant-derived compounds (phytoestro-gens) have this SERM characteristic withoutunacceptable adverse effects. These prepara-tions presently play a major role as cosmeceu-ticals in the skin care industry. Among thesteroidal and nonsteroidal SERM’s used toenhance aging skin, two phytoestrogen/botan-icals, an analog of resveratrol [40-acetoxyresveratrol (4AR)], and a newer isoﬂavonoid
resveratrol (4AR)], and a newer isoﬂavonoidcompound, equol, have peer-reviewed in vitroand novel clinical study results that support theimprovement of estrogen-deﬁcient skin arereviewed as potential indicators of futuredirections in this ﬁeld.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe thank Janet Faye (at BYU) for her assistancein generating some of the ﬁgure graphics andtext editing.Funding.
