ORIGINAL RESEARCHProspective Evaluation of the Efﬁcacy of a FoodSupplement in Increasing Photoprotectionand Improving Selective Markers Related to SkinPhoto-AgeingCorinne Granger .Sonia Aladren .Jesus Delgado .Aurora Garre .Carles Trullas .Yolanda GilaberteReceived: October 4, 2019 / Published online: December 4, 2019/C211The Author(s) 2019ABSTRACTIntroduction : Skin exposure to ultravioletradiation (UVR) can cause oxidative stress, par-ticularly in the absence of adequate protectivemeasures or in individuals with a sensitive skintype. Most commonly, protection from UVRentails the use of topical sunscreens. Sun-screens, however, have various limitations. Theobjective of this study was to evaluate the efﬁ-cacy and tolerability of an oral food supplementcontaining a combination of actives withmainly antioxidative properties (vitamins A, C,D3, E, selenium, lycopene, lutein, as well asgreen tea, polypodium and grape extracts) in
the context of photoprotection.Methods : Photoprotective efﬁcacy was assessedin a 12-week-long, open, prospective and mono-centric clinical study with 30 subjects (27 womenand 3 men) having a Fitzpatrick skin type I-III andmanifesting clinical ageing signs. The studyincluded several visits (14, 28, 56, and 84 daysafter starting supplement intake), in which pho-toprotection was evaluated by the measurementof the minimal erythema dose (MED), while theantioxidant capacity of the skin was assessedthrough ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)and malondialdehyde (MDA) assays. Addition-ally, several skin parameters (including radiance,elasticity, and moisture) were evaluated. Productevaluation was performed throughout the lengthof the study by means of a self-assessment ques-tionnaire, and safety was monitored through aself-recording of all observed adverse reactions.Results : The MED levels increased signiﬁcantlycompared to baseline throughout the study visits,
compared to baseline throughout the study visits,reaching an increase of ?8.1% at T84, p\0.001.FRAP results also indicated a signiﬁcant increasein the antioxidant capacity of the skin comparedto baseline ( ?22.7% at T84, p\0.001), while theMDA assay showed a signiﬁcant decrease in MDAconcentration compared to baseline ( -6.4% atT84, p\0.001) which, in line with the FRAPresults, indicated enhanced antioxidative pro-tection of the skin. All assessed skin parameters,including radiance ( ?36.1% at T84, p\0.001),gross elasticity ( ?13.2% at T84, p\0.001), netelasticity ( ?28.0% at T84, p\0.001), and mois-ture ( ?13.8% at T84, p\0.001) were alsoEnhanced Digital Features To view enhanced digitalfeatures for this article go to https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.ﬁgshare.10298486 .Electronic supplementary material The onlineversion of this article ( https://doi.org/10.1007/s13555-019-00345-y ) contains supplementary material, which isavailable to authorized users.

Protection from UVRentails the use of topical sunscreens.However, a combined dietary approach toreinforce skin protection could provide acontinuous adjunctive measure and couldbe of great interest.This study aims to assess the efﬁcacy andtolerability of an oral food supplementcontaining a combination of actives withmainly antioxidative properties.What Was Learned from the Study?The food supplement was effective andwell-tolerated, demonstrating a beneﬁcialeffect in terms of photoprotection,enhancing the antioxidative status of theskin and improving general skin condition.The outcomes can provide goodindications for the protective effects ofnutritional interventions in the area ofsun protection.INTRODUCTIONThe skin is in continuous contact with theexternal environment, and because of this, it isdaily subjected to several aggressive environ-mental stressors (e.g. mechanical, chemical,toxic, thermal) as well as to pathogenic
toxic, thermal) as well as to pathogenicmicroorganisms that affect its physiology.Notably, one of the key environmental agentsaffecting the skin is solar ultraviolet radiation(UVR) [ 1]. Excessive UVR exposure has beenassociated with short-term harmful outcomessuch as sunburn (erythema) and photo-im-munosuppression [ 2], but also with long-termconsequences such as actinic damage (e.g. acti-nic keratosis) [ 3,4], photo-ageing [ 5] and skincancer [ 6,7].The UVR reaching the earth’s surface coversa wide wavelength range (290–400 nm) and isdivided into two bands: UVB (290–320 nm) andUVA (320–400 nm). Although UVA has lessenergy than UVB, it can penetrate deeper intothe skin, and its exposure may generate reactiveoxygen species (ROS) which can damage DNAthrough indirect photosensitization reactions[8–11]. Meanwhile, UVB can be absorbeddirectly by the DNA, forming speciﬁc photo-products such as cyclobutane dimers and 6–4photoproducts, which cause molecular DNA
photoproducts, which cause molecular DNArearrangements. Since skin irradiation by eitherUVA or UVB has been shown to modify bio-logical tissues, the International Agency forResearch on Cancer (IARC) classiﬁed solar UVRas a carcinogen almost three decades ago [ 12].Sunscreens are applied topically to protectthe skin from solar UVR exposure. It has beenshown that the sun protection conferred bythese products, measured in sun protectionfactor (SPF), tends to be overestimated undertest conditions compared to real life, as veryoften the quantity applied in real life is less thanthe one recommended, and it is difﬁcult toassess whether the product has sufﬁcientlycovered the skin area that is going to be exposed[13]. Consequently, a combined dietaryapproach to reinforce skin protection couldprovide a continuous adjunctive measure andcould be of great interest [ 14].164 Dermatol Ther (Heidelb) (2020) 10:163–178
Several substances are effective in avertingUV-induced skin alterations [ 15]. Oral agentssuch as essential micronutrients, vitamins (in-cluding vitamins C, D, and D3 — alone or in amixture), minerals (selenium), polyphenols(including Camellia sinensis ,Vitis vinifera L., andPolypodium leucotomos Poir), and carotenoids(including lutein, lycopene and b-carotene),among others, have exhibited photoprotectiveand anti-photocarcinogenic properties [ 15,16].These constituents display the potential toimprove systemic protection not only againstUVR but also to the visible and infrared (IR)ranges of sunlight. Skin protection is achievedthrough different mechanisms that promoteantioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory, andimmunomodulatory effects preventing photo-induced carcinogenesis and ageing andimproving the appearance and pigmentation ofthe skin [ 15].Vitamins are organic compounds that areinvolved in skincare and health, displaying
involved in skincare and health, displayingantioxidant activity and promoting collagensynthesis, keratinisation, sebum regulation andphotoprotection [ 17]. For instance, vitamin D3,orally administered 1 h after experimental sun-burn, has been shown to attenuate the inﬂam-matory response by decreasing pro-inﬂammatory regulators such as tumour necro-sis factor-alpha (TNF- a) and inducible nitricoxide synthase (iNOS) [ 18–21]. Vitamin C is awell-established antioxidant agent. Skin cellsharbour high concentrations of vitamin C [ 22],to enhance collagen synthesis and provideantioxidant protection against UV-inducedphotodamage. Vitamin C is also thought toregenerate cutaneous vitamin E from its radicalform, and the combination of both vitaminsacts synergistically [ 23]. A combination of vita-mins C and E in a double-blind, placebo-con-trolled study showed that oral treatmentreduced sunburn, UV-induced skin damage andcutaneous blood ﬂow when compared to theplacebo group [ 24].
Carotenoids (including lutein, lycopene andb-carotene) are pigments present in a widevariety of vegetables and fruits and humansobtain them through the diet [ 25]. In vitro andin vivo studies have shown that carotenoids cansuppress UVR-mediated reactive oxygen species(ROS) production, and thus prevent photoin-activation of antioxidant proteins, lipid perox-idation, and DNA damage [ 15,26]. For instance,it has been demonstrated that when orallysupplemented, lutein prompts a signiﬁcantreduction of the UVA-induced overexpressionof several genes [ 27]. Supplementation withlycopene has been found to decrease ROS pro-duction, which in turn protects cellular struc-tures from UVR-induced damage [ 28].Regarding b-carotene supplementation, severalclinical trials have also shown that it candiminish the intensity of erythema caused bysunlight [ 29,30].Selenium is an essential mineral thatincreases the activity of various antioxidant
increases the activity of various antioxidantenzymes. Some clinical studies propose thatselenium supplementation protects the skinagainst many of the harmful effects of UVBradiation [ 31].Polyphenols are plant-derived agents whosephotoprotective properties can be linked totheir antioxidant, anti-proliferative, anti-car-cinogenic and anti-inﬂammatory properties[32]. For example, green tea polyphenols (GTPs)have been studied extensively in vitro, in vivoand in human studies [ 33], showing chemo-preventive effects against UVB-induced skincancer.Grape seed extract (GSE) is also rich inproanthocyanins. In a 1-year study of Japanesewomen with chloasma, oral administration of67 mg of GSE 3 times a day effectively decreasedhyperpigmentation, and the extract was shownto be safe and well-tolerated [ 34].Finally, Polypodium leucotomos (PL), is atropical fern plant that has long been used intraditional medicine in Central and SouthAmerica. PL is rich in polyphenolic compounds,

PL is rich in polyphenolic compounds,which have been shown to have photoprotec-tive properties inhibiting the UVR-inducedgeneration and release of ROS, which in turnprevents DNA damage while protecting andenhancing the natural antioxidant enzymesystems of the skin [ 35,36]. Consequently, PLcan be used as an oral adjuvant agent to reducethe adverse effects of UVR exposure byimproving the photoprotective capacity of theskin [ 37].Dermatol Ther (Heidelb) (2020) 10:163–178 165
The goal of this clinical study was to assessthe efﬁcacy of a food supplement containingsome of these sustances against UV-inducedskin damage and oxidative stress.METHODSStudy DesignThe present study was an open, prospective andmonocentric clinical study, conducted by acontract research organisation (CRO) in SanMartino Siccomario (PV) (Italy). The study pro-tocol was approved by the Independent EthicalCommittee for Non-Pharmacological Clinicaltrials of Genova, according to the Italian regu-lations, on 5 September, 2018 (Record no. E.HU-016-0030.01.005L_2018_2323). Study proce-dures were carried out following the Declarationof Helsinki, as revised in 2018, and good clinicalpractice guidelines. Written informed consentwas obtained from all patients beforeenrolment.Patient SelectionThe study enrolled thirty healthy female andmale subjects of Caucasian ethnicity, agedbetween 40 and 65 years with a Fitzpatrickphototype between I and III [ 38], manifesting
phototype between I and III [ 38], manifestingclinical ageing signs (chronological-ageing andphoto-ageing) and with at least one dark spoton the face. All participants were screened andenrolled under the supervision of a dermatolo-gist, according to protocol inclusion/exclusioncriteria.Sample size was calculated with a two-sided5% signiﬁcance level and a power of 80%,considering a 20% variation of the primaryendpoints due to both inter-individual humanvariability and error in the measurement tech-niques. A sample size of 20 subjects was neces-sary, given an anticipated dropout rate of 20%.Subjects were required not to have beenrecently involved in a similar study, to submitbefore and after pictures, to use the productduring the whole study period, not to vary theirdaily habits or dietary routine and to useeffective contraceptive methods. Additionally,subjects were required to continue using theirusual sun protection measures when exposed tothe sun.
the sun.Exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lacta-tion, allergies or sensitivity to cosmetic prod-ucts, toiletries, sunscreens, and/or topical drugs,dermatological problems in the test area, posi-tive anamnesis for atopy, use of self-tanningproducts for at least 1 month before study startor regular use of tanning beds.Primary and Secondary EndpointsThe primary endpoints concerning photopro-tection entailed the assessment of minimalerythema dose (MED) and antioxidant capacityof the skin.The secondary endpoints conﬁrmed producttolerability and the effect of the product onselected skin parameters related to skin ageing(skin moisturisation, elasticity, radiance andcolour of skin dark spot). Furthermore, a sub-jective evaluation of efﬁcacy and tolerabilitywas performed by the study participantsthrough a self-assessment questionnaire.InterventionThe study was conducted between October2018 and January 2019. The starting date of the
2018 and January 2019. The starting date of thestudy was selected to minimize the inﬂuence ofsolar radiation exposure on the parametersevaluated during the study. The investigationalproduct (IP) was an oral food supplement con-taining VitAox Ultra (Table 1). The intakeregime consisted of one capsule per day for12 weeks, to be taken every morning withplenty of liquid.Assessment of Minimal Erythema Dose(MED)A provisional minimal erythema dose (MED)was assessed on the back skin of each studysubject up to a week before the primary MEDtest. The range of UV doses to be applied duringthe study was established based on the166 Dermatol Ther (Heidelb) (2020) 10:163–178
estimated MED (according to laboratory expe-rience, subject SPF testing history, and skintype).During the primary MED test, six subsitescentred around the provisional MED wereexposed to incremental UV doses using a1.15 9geometric progression. The MED wasassessed visually, under blind conditions,20±4 h after UV exposure. MED assessmentwas carried out in a room with matt neutral wallcolour and sufﬁcient illumination conditions(at least 450 lux).Antioxidant Capacity of the SkinThe antioxidant capacity was determined onthe back skin using two standard biochemicalmethods: ferric reducing antioxidant power(FRAP) and malondialdehyde assay (MDA). Bothmethods rely on the use of Corneoﬁx/C210foils(Courage ?Khazaka electronic GmbH) to col-lect different layers of the stratum corneum.FRAP AssayThe FRAP assay was used as a direct measure ofthe total reducing power of the skin and as an
the total reducing power of the skin and as anindirect index of the capability of the skin toresist oxidative damage. The FRAP reaction [ 39],namely the reduction of the complex TPTZ-Fe(III) into the ferrous form [Fe(II)], was moni-tored via a colorimetric measurement at595 nm. The recorded absorbances were com-pared to an Fe(II) standard curve of knownvalues. The results were directly proportional tothe total reducing power of the antioxidant inthe reaction mix.MDA AssayMDA is a speciﬁc biomarker of oxidative stressfor lipids, reﬂecting the state of lipid peroxida-tion. MDA content was used as an oxidativestress index linked to the lipid peroxide com-ponent of skin cells. MDA content was assayedby a colourimetric measurement [ 40], based onthe capability of a chromogen, Nmethyl 2phenylindole (NMPI), to react with MDA at45/C176C and acidic pH to produce a stable bluechromophore with an absorption peak between
chromophore with an absorption peak between540 and 590 nm. A calibration curve of growingconcentrations of standard MDA was used. Theresults were expressed as MDA concentration(lM) 4 h and 24 h after UVA exposure. Theradiation dose of UVA exposure was 5 J/cm2.Skin MoisturisationMeasurement of skin moisturisation was per-formed according to the internationally recog-nised epidermal capacitance measurementusing a Corneometer CM 825(Courage ?Khazaka, electronic GmbH) at ﬁvepoints on the right cheek of each subject [ 41].Measurement of Skin RadianceSkin radiance was measured on the cheek usinga spectrophotometer/colourimeter CM 700D(Konica Minolta), by illuminating the skin withdiffuse light, generated by the Ulbricht sphereof the colourimeter, which allows the determi-nation of the gloss component by calculatingthe relationship between directional and diffusereﬂection. The method is called 8 /C176gloss valuebecause the sensor measuring the light is 8 /C176to

Measurement of Colour of Skin Dark Spots(ITA/C176)The colour of the skin dark spots was deter-mined through ITA /C176assessment. ITA /C176was cal-culated based on the L* and b* parameter valuesas follows: ITA /C176= [arctan( L50)/b*]180/ p. TheITA/C176system classiﬁes the subjects into six skintypes, from very light to dark skin (verylight [55/C176[light [41/C176[intermediate [28/C176[tan[10/C176[brown [-30/C176[dark) [ 43,44].Skin ElasticitySkin elasticity was measured in the same cheekarea with a Cutometer/C210MPA 580(Courage ?Khazaka, electronic GmbH), basedon a suction method that mechanically deformsthe skin [ 45]. The device uses negative pressure(450 mbar) so that the skin of the subject isdrawn into the aperture of the probe (suctionon) for 2 s and released again (suction off). Anon-contact optical measuring system deter-mined the penetration depth of the skin. Theresistance of the skin to the negative pressure
resistance of the skin to the negative pressureand its ability to return into its original positionwere displayed as curves (R0 = Uf = penetrationdepth in mm/time) in real-time during themeasurement. Two skin elasticity indices weremeasured (Fig. 1): (1) R2 (Ua/Uf), gross elasticityor overall elasticity, which represents the abilityof re-deformation of the skin to its basal state,and (2) R5 (Ur/Ue), net elasticity whichrepresents the elastic recovery of the skindeformation to its basal state due to its elasticcomponent.Subjective Self-Assessmentof the Properties of the ProductAll study participants evaluated the use of theproduct by ﬁlling out a self-assessment ques-tionnaire starting at week 2 (T14) and during allsubsequent study visits [week 4 (T28), 8 (T56)and 12 (T84)]. Subjects were asked severalquestions to evaluate the ease of use of theproduct (e.g. size, colour, and taste of the cap-sules) as well as some skin parameters related to
sules) as well as some skin parameters related toskin ageing (e.g. luminosity, brightness, andﬂexibility). Participants also had to notify anyadverse reactions (see the section below).Evaluation of Safety and Tolerabilityof the ProductSubjects were asked to include from the ﬁrst dayof the study, in a personal evaluation form,unpleasant experiences and adverse reactions(AEs) related to the use of product. A derma-tologist assessed and recorded all observed AEsand relevant ﬁndings to evaluate the safety andtolerability of the product.Statistical AnalysesValues were expressed as the mean and standarderror of the mean (SEM). Intergroup (betweentreatments) statistical analysis was carried outusing multivariate analysis of variance (M-ANOVA) followed by two-way Student’s t-test. Ap\0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.Statistical analysis output was reported as fol-lows: * p\0.05 ** p\0.01, and *** p\0.001.RESULTSSubjects

Study subjects attended the clinic at baseline(T0), and after 2 weeks (T14), 4 weeks (T28),8 weeks (T56) and 12 weeks (T84) of productuse. All subjects were included in the safetyanalysis data set.Minimal Erythema Dose (MED)A statistically signiﬁcant increase in the MEDthreshold compared to baseline (T0) wasobserved after 14, 28, 56 and 84 days of treat-ment (Fig. 2). The mean variation in the per-centage of MED was ?1.5% at T14 ( p\0.05),?3.0% at T28 ( p\0.01), ?6.1% at T56(p\0.01) and ?8.1% at T84 ( p\0.001),showing a progressive increase of the UV radi-ation dose necessary to induce erythema.The Antioxidant Capacity of the SkinFerric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP)MeasurementThe mean FRAP values displayed a statisticallysigniﬁcant increase after 14, 28, 56 and 84 daysof treatment when compared to the baseline(T0) (Fig. 3). The mean variation in the per-centage of the FRAP values was ?12.0% at T14,?13.3% at T28, ?16.5% at T56 and ?22.7% at
?13.3% at T28, ?16.5% at T56 and ?22.7% atT84 (all time points, p\0.001), indicating anincrease in the antioxidant capacity of the skin.Lipid Peroxidation (LPO) ThroughMalondialdehyde (MDA) MeasurementBasal lipid peroxidation (before UVA exposure)as measured by MDA concentration showed astatistically signiﬁcant decrease at T28 ( -3.4%;Table 2 Baseline characteristics of subjectsUnitsSex Male 2 subjects 7 %Female 28 subjects 93 %Skin phototype (Fitzpatrick*) I 3 subjects 10.0 %II 10 subjects 33.3 %III 17 subjects 56.7 %Age (mean) 55.6 ±1.4 YearsMinimal erythema dose (MED) 38.1 mJ/cm2Skin moisturisation 37.7 a.u.Skin elasticity (R0 = Uf) 0.3512 RatioSkin elasticity (R2 = Ua/Uf) 0.7137 RatioSkin elasticity (R5 = Ur/Ue) 0.2788 RatioSkin radiance 8.71 a.u.Lvalues (luminance) 57.77 a.u.ITA angle 22.82 ( /C176)MDA (basal) 1.51 ±0.01 lMMDA 4 h (after UV exposure) at 0 2.62 ±0.01 lMMDA 24 h (after UV exposure) at 0 2.03 ±0.01 lMFRAP 160.2 ±2.3 Fe(II) lM

p\0.001), T56 ( -3.3%; p\0.001), and T84(-6.4%; p\0.001) compared to T0 (Fig. 4a).As expected, in both measurements, 4 h and24 h after UVA exposure (5 J/cm2), an increasein MDA was observed in all visits (T0 through toT84) compared to measurements before UVAexposure. In Fig. 4b, positive values indicate anincrease in MDA concentration expressed as apercentage variation of measurements per-formed before UVA exposure on the same day.Nonetheless, compared to previous visits, asmaller increase in MDA concentration wasobserved at each visit, both 4 h and 24 h afterUVA exposure. More speciﬁcally, at T0, a 74.0%increase was observed 4 h after UVA exposure,whereas at T84 the increase was 53.3%(p\0.001) 4 h after UVA irradiation. At 24 hpost UVA exposure, a 34.7% increase wasrecorded at baseline (T0), whereas a 14.9%increase was registered at T84 ( p\0.001). This‘‘reduced rate of increase’’ is statically signiﬁcant
at T28, T56 and T84 when MDA measurementswere performed 4 h after UVA exposure, and atall time points (T14, T28, T56 and T84) whenMDA was measured 24 h after irradiation.Skin MoisturisationA statistically signiﬁcant increase in mean skinmoisturisation values was achieved after 14 daysof treatment when compared to basal condi-tions (T0). This increase was sustained for thewhole of the duration of the study (as measuredat T28, T56 and T84) (Fig. 5). Accordingly, themean variation in the percentage of skin mois-turisation compared to T0 was ?9.9% at T14,?13.5% at T28, ?14.2% at T56 and ?13.8% atT84 (all time points, p\0.001).Skin RadianceSkin gloss, also referred to as skin radiance,displayed a statistically signiﬁcant increase after14, 28, 56 and 84 days of treatment whencompared to basal conditions (T0) (Fig. 6). Morespeciﬁcally, the mean variation in the percent-age of the skin radiance compared to T0increased by ?15.2% at T14, ?20.6% at T28,
increased by ?15.2% at T14, ?20.6% at T28,?30.7% at T56 and ?36.1% at T84 (all timepoints, p\0.001).Skin Dark Spots (L and ITA/C176)Skin lightness (L), exhibited a statistically sig-niﬁcant increase after 14, 28, 56 and 84 days oftreatment when compared to basal conditions(T0) (Fig. 7a).

The mean ofgross skin elasticity increased by ?8.8% at T14,?10.9% at T28, ?11.9% at T56 and ?13.2% atT84 (all time points, p\0.001) and the mean ofnet skin elasticity increased by ?14.4% at T14,?16.8% at T28, ?24.4% at T56 and ?28.0% atT84 (all time points, p\0.001).Subjective Self-Assessmentof the Properties of the ProductThe subjective and qualitative evaluation of theefﬁcacy of the product showed that according tostudy subjects, the use of the product has beenbeneﬁcial for the skin (Fig. 9: data set availablein Table S1). A set of questions was answered byall subjects at all study visits (T14, T28, T56, andT84) using a self-assessment questionnaire form.The score of most of the answers (14/17) con-tinuously improved throughout the length ofthe study (from T14 to T84).Evaluation of Safety and TolerabilityThe study participants reported two adverse
events during the length of the study; namely,Fig. 7 Lightness of the skin. aLvalues; bITA/C176values onan identiﬁed brown spot of the subjects. Both graphs showmean values obtained at T0, T14, T28, T56 and T84.Data are represented as the mean of Lvalues ±SEM (ina.u.) and the mean of ITA angle ±SEM in degrees ( /C176),respectively.

one reported that the product was difﬁcult todigest, while the second reported slight stom-ach burns during the last weeks of treatment.However, based on the opinion of the investi-gators, these adverse events were not clearlyattributable to the intake of the product.Therefore, the food supplement was consideredwell-tolerated.DISCUSSIONIn the quest to provide additional means ofincreasing sun protection levels for humanbeings, oral photoprotection may be of signiﬁ-cant interest [ 15,46].The study of this food supplement, contain-ing a mix of actives such as carotenoids,Fig. 8 Skin ﬁrmness and elasticity measured with theCutometer/C210.aR0 parameter — skin ﬁrmness; bR2parameter — gross skin elasticity; cR5 parameter — netskin elasticity.

vitamins, selenium and phytochemicals,showed that when administered orally for12 weeks it was capable of increasing the mini-mal erythema dose (MED), increasing theantioxidant capacity of the skin, and it ame-liorated skin parameters related to skin ageingsuch as skin moisturisation, elasticity, radianceand colour of dark spots.The MED results showed that oral intake ofthe product may induce a gradual increase inthe amount of UV radiation necessary to induceminimal erythema, and thereby the productmay contribute to photoprotection. In com-parison with other studies showing signiﬁcantresults for MED after 4 to 12 weeks of supple-mentation [ 47,48] we observed in the presentstudy a modest but statistically signiﬁcant andprogressive impact on MED that was observed asearly as after 2 weeks of oral intake.The FRAP measurement also showed thatsupplementation with the study product sig-niﬁcantly increased the antioxidant capacity ofthe skin by 12% after 2 weeks (T14) and up to
the skin by 12% after 2 weeks (T14) and up to22.7% after 12 weeks (T84) of product use.In this study, basal MDA (when no experi-mental UVA exposure is performed) decreasedin consecutive visits, indicating that the processof lipid peroxidation in attenuated. A statisti-cally signiﬁcant effect has also been observedwhen looking at MDA levels 4 h and 24 h afterexperimental UVA exposure. In both cases, thelevels of MDA are increased as a result of theUVA exposure, but the per cent increasedecreased over consecutive visits, indicating aneffect of the food supplement in enhancing theantioxidant capacity of the skin. In comparisonwith other studies showing signiﬁcantimprovement of hydration, radiance, L*, ITA /C176and elasticity after 4–25 weeks of oral intake[49,50], in the present study a statistically sig-niﬁcant improvement in these parameters wasobserved starting after 2 weeks of product use.The skin hydration results show that the food
supplement quickly increased skin moisturisa-tion levels, and was able to maintain higher skinhydration during the course of the study.Additionally, skin radiance, L*, ITA /C176and elas-ticity continuously improved during the12 weeks of product use. The product demon-strated a high tolerance since the only twoadverse events that were reported by studyparticipants were not serious and notattributable to product intake, based on theopinion of the investigators. Consequently, thetreatment was not interrupted by any of thestudy participants. The methods used to evalu-ate product tolerability have been previouslyvalidated in relevant studies [ 51–53]. Apart fromthe two adverse events previously mentioned,all the investigated aspects concerning theproduct were positively assessed by enrolledsubjects.The design of the study may have certainmethodological limitations; for example, mostof the subjects in the study were female.Nonetheless, since the molecular, cellular, and
tissue-speciﬁc events leading to inﬂammationand photo-ageing are the same among genders,the study outcomes can be extrapolated to theFig. 9 Score in percentage provided by the study subjectson several skin health parameters evaluated throughout thestudy (T14, T28, T56, and T84). The data are representedas the mean score provided by all the subjects throughoutthe study length. Each answer has four columns repre-senting the mean of the scores for T14, T28, T56, andT84 (from left to right), respectively174 Dermatol Ther (Heidelb) (2020) 10:163–178
general population. As the product evaluated isa combination of several active ingredients, it isdifﬁcult to establish the relevance of each one ofthe ingredients in the efﬁcacy observed. Eventhough the present study is an open study (non-randomised study — NRS) with no placebotreatment, outcomes can provide good indica-tions for the protective effects of nutritionalinterventions in the area of sun protection.CONCLUSIONSThe food supplement evaluated (VitAox Ultra)has been shown to be effective and well-toler-ated in increasing minimal erythemal dose(MED), antioxidant capacity of the skin andimproving skin parameters related to skin age-ing. These positive effects can be explained byan increase in the antioxidant capacity of theskin promoted by the oral intake of this foodsupplement.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe thank the participants of the study.Funding.
