symmetry, averageness, and sexual dimorphism, may reflect adaptations for mate choice because theysignal aspects of mate quality. Here, we show that facial skin color distribution significantly influencesthe perception of age and attractiveness of female faces, independent of facial form and skin surfacetopography. A set of three-dimensional shape-standardized stimulus faces—varying only in terms ofskin color distribution due to variation in biological age and cumulative photodamage—was rated by apanel of naive judges for a variety of perceptual endpoints relating to age, health, and beauty. Shape-
and topography-standardized stimulus faces with the homogeneous skin color distribution of youngpeople were perceived as younger and received significantly higher ratings for attractiveness andhealth than analogous stimuli with the relatively inhomogeneous skin color distribution of moreelderly people. Thus, skin color distribution, independent of facial form and skin surface topography,seems to have a major influence on the perception of female facial age and judgments of attractivenessand health as they may signal aspects of underlying physiological condition of an individual relevantfor mate choice.

IntroductionColoration of feather and skin is known to influence sexual attractiveness in a wide varietyof nonhuman animals ( Andersson, 1994 ), and studies on pigmentation in birds havesuggested that color signals may directly signal immunocompetence and health ( Blount,Metcalfe, Birkhead, & Surai, 2003; McGraw & Ardia, 2003 ). A number of studies with birdshave demonstrated that carotenoid-based coloration affects mate choice (e.g., McGraw &Hill, 2000 ). Although physical attractiveness in humans and its perception have been studiedextensively in the past few years (see, for a review, Fink & Penton-Voak, 2002; Grammer,
Fink, M bller, & Thornhill, 2003), there is only limited information available on the potentialsignaling value of visible skin color. It has been suggested that skin color has a significanteffect on human mate selection since paler skin is a youthful and desired feature ( Darwin,1871; Frost, 1988; Van den Berghe & Frost, 1986 ), especially in women, but, to ourknowledge, there have been only two empirical tests of this hypothesis in women.Fink, Grammer, and Thornhill (2001) demonstrated that women’s facial skin textureaffects male judgment of facial attractiveness and found that homogeneous skin (i.e., an evendistribution of features relating to both skin color and skin surface topography) is mostattractive. Further, it was found that a slightly reddish skin (which may indicate more efficientblood circulation) is considered attractive and healthy. Analogous to the manner in which
coloration plays a role in mate choice in birds, therefore, visible color and color distribution inhuman facial skin may provide an indication of the age, health, and attractiveness of therespective individual. More recently, Jones, Little, Burt, and Perrett (2004) demonstratedthat ratings of attractiveness of small skin patches extracted from the left and right cheeks ofmale facial images significantly correlated with ratings of facial attractiveness. It was alsofound that apparent health of skin influences male facial attractiveness, independent ofshape information.The findings of these two studies lend some support to the notion that skin colordistribution influences facial attractiveness and suggest that attractive physical traitspositively influence the perception of an individual’s health. However, both studies usedfacial photographs of Caucasian men and women at college age (i.e., 18–25 years), which is
not representative with regard to the variance in skin condition, which is probably smallwithin that age range and may, thus, only provide information about a particular age group.Moreover, both studies were designed to control for possible age effects of different skinconditions rather than to study age-related variance of skin condition and its effects on facialattractiveness. Some recent evidence for the association between perception of attractivenessB. Fink et al. / Evolution and Human Behavior 27 (2006) 433–442 434
and skin condition, though in males, comes from Roberts et al. (2005) . These authors reportthat patches of skin from the cheeks of men being heterozygous at three loci in the majorhistocompatibility complex (MHC) were judged healthier than skin of homozygous men, andthese ratings correlated with attractiveness judgments of the faces.All those studies that investigated apparent attractiveness and health of skin did notdifferentiate between skin surface topography and skin color distribution. However, in viewof evidence from medical studies, this seems to be of particular relevance. In addition tochanges in skin appearance due to chronological aging, there is consensus among thescientific and medical communities that exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in ordinarysunlight is a major factor in the etiology of the progressive, undesirable changes in theappearance of skin (chronic photodamage/photoaging) and in the risk of skin cancer
(American Academy of Dermatology Consensus Conference, 1988; Bergfeld et al., 1997;Council of Scientific Affairs, 1989; Fisher et al., 1997; IARC, 1992; IARC, 2001; NationalInstitutes of Health, 1989; Wlaschek et al., 2001 ). Caucasian skin is particularly prone toultraviolet (UV) light injury (e.g., de Gruijl, 1999 ), and episodes of sunburn, even inchildhood, have been shown to be associated with an increased risk factor for photocarcino-genesis, photoaging, and photoimmunosuppression (e.g., Naldi et al., 2005 ). It is likely thatorganisms with a higher resistance against such risk factors are also favored in contests for amate and are, therefore, perceived as more attractive.The present study investigated the perception of facial age and attractiveness in relation toapparent skin color distribution. Since age and attractiveness are known to be influenced byfacial form ( Perrett, May, & Yoshikawa, 1994 ) and facial furrows ( Leveque & Goubanova,
2004 ), a set of three-dimensional (3D) shape-standardized stimulus faces was generated,which varied only in terms of visible skin color distribution and chronological age,respectively. We hypothesized that visible facial skin color distribution significantlyinfluences the perception of biological age and attractiveness of females. Clearly, shape-standardized faces with the applied skin color distribution of young people should beperceived younger, healthier, and more attractive than shape-standardized faces that receivethe skin color distribution of older people. If this hypothesis were true, it would argue for aninfluence of visible skin color distribution on the perception of female facial attractiveness.2. Methods2.1. Stimulus materialA total of 170 British women from the ages of 11 to 76 years (mean age=37.39,S.D.=17.35) were recruited and photographed from three views: frontal, left, and right
profiles. This was achieved using a custom digital imaging rig comprising a 6.2-megapixeldigital single-lens reflex camera fitted with a Nikkor 45-mm 1:2.8P lens (Nikon Corporation,Tokyo, Japan), a fully cross-polarized multiple flash lighting system, and a chin rest to ensureaccurate, reproducible positioning of subjects and overall component stability. Images werecaptured and stored in uncompressed TIFF format at a resolution of 3277 /C22226 pixels andB. Fink et al. / Evolution and Human Behavior 27 (2006) 433–442 435
72 dpi. No color correction or spatial filtering was applied to these images. One image wasfinally removed from the sample because of problems with image quality, resulting in a finalset of n=169 faces (with three views of each).Full cross-polarization of the light source was used to effectively eliminate visible high-frequency/low-amplitude skin surface topography ( bmicrotexture Q). In order to avoid thepotential influence of high-amplitude skin surface topography (i.e., facial furrows, folds,lines, wrinkles) on age perception and attractiveness ratings, we carefully removed thesefeatures at the mouth, nose, and at the orbital region using the soft cloning stamp in AdobePhotoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., USA), with samples of unaffected skin adjacent to therespective feature being cloned to replace them. For the creation of two-dimensional (2D)skin color maps, each face was fitted onto a 2D template by matching the position of pupils
and mouth gap with the template. These 2D skin color maps used frontal and side views ofimages, thus preserving the 3D information (spatial color distribution) of the faces. Theindividual 2D skin color maps were then matched with a template grid in order to fit on ashape-standardized 3D wire-frame mesh on the basis of definition of digital somatometriclandmarks for the eyes and the mouth and the use of thin-plate spline algorithm (for detailsabout the methodology, see Bookstein, 1997 ). Before the final rendering of 3D faces, testrenders were made in order to detect possible artifacts until the results were satisfactory.Final rendering of 3D faces was achieved using Poser 6 (e-frontier, Scotts Valley, CA,USA). The virtual camera position of the render engine was set to the middle of the face witha focus of 160 mm in order to avoid optical distortion. Camera plane and face plane were
parallel. Render size was set at 650 /C2816 pixels, resulting in faces of 19 cm length at a screenresolution of 1600 /C21200 pixels. The result was a set of n=169 3D facial images, standardizedFig. 1. 3D facial images, standardized in shape but preserving individual skin color distribution of the original 2Dfacial photographs. bReal age Qrefers to the age of the participant from which the digital photograph was taken, andbEstimated age Qdenotes the mean (with decimals removed) of estimated age from all participants for the final 3Dstimulus face.B.

in shape while preserving the individual skin color variation of the original 2D facialphotographs ( Fig. 1 ). In order to increase photo-realism, a skin-shading system was used,which added subsurface scatter (i.e., light passing through and diffusing within a thintranslucent material) to the skin color maps. Hairstyle and eye color were also kept constantwithin all images. Lighting was fixed within each image by applying two virtual lightsources. Shadow mapping was performed using one virtual light source, and the secondvirtual light source used ambient occlusion in order to further enforce the same shape on theskin color map for the observer. To guarantee a consistent color work environment, we carriedout all photo manipulations, the stimulus generation, and the final ratings of stimuli on color-corrected monitors (LaCie electron 19blue IV, LaCie, Hillsboro, OR, USA).2.2. Rating studyA total of 430 participants (198 males and 232 females), mainly nonstudents, between the
ages of 13 and 76 years (mean age=29.45, S.D.=12.24) rated the stimulus faces on color-corrected CRT monitors (LaCie electron 19blue IV, LaCie) set to a resolution of 1600 /C21200 pixels. Faces were presented randomly on the screen, and each participant rated10 randomly selected stimuli. Participants were requested to estimate the biological age ofeach face using a single-step scale ranging from 10 to 60 years. In addition, participants wereasked to rate each face for three global descriptors of facial perception (attractive, healthy, andyouthful) and 12 aspects of skin condition in particular (luminous, even tone, clear/translucent, pure, mottled, beautiful, firm, elastic, aged, wrinkled, soft, and smooth) using a10-point rating. A final question probed the ease with which participants were able to performthe rating task, using a 10-point scale (1= difficult to 10= easy). Here, we report only the
statistical results of the ratings for perceived attractiveness, healthiness, and youthfulness,which (a) are most relevant to the perception of overall facial appearance and (b) enable amore ready comparison with previous studies.3. ResultsThe estimated biological age (aggregated estimates from all judges for each face) of facialimages ranged from 17.8 to 36.7 years (mean age=24.47, S.D.=7.14), a span of some 20 years.A one-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-fit test indicated that actual and estimatedage and all three attributes were normally distributed (actual age: Z=1.043, p=.227; estimatedage: Z=.989, p=.282; attractive: Z=.410, p=.996; healthy: Z=.600, p=.864; youthful: Z=.883,p=.416). There was a significant positive correlation (Pearson’s r) between the actualbiological age of the subjects who provided facial images and the corresponding estimatedage of their 3D shape-standardized faces varying only in visible skin color distribution
(r=.708, pb.01, two tailed). Significant negative correlations emerged between estimatedfacial age and the global face attributes (attractive: r=/C0.557, pb.01; healthy: r=/C0.543, pb.01;youthful: r=/C0.871, pb.01). Reliability of male and female perception of age and ratedattributes was high with Cronbach avalues between .60 and .83, the exception being theB.

question relating to the ease with which participants were able to perform the rating task(Cronbach a=.064). On average, males considered the evaluation of female attractiveness andage-related changes of skin color distribution to be a significantly easier task than females(t=2.056, df=168, pb.05).On the basis of our results, visible skin color distribution appears to have major influenceon the perception of female facial age and judgments of attractiveness, health, and youth.4. DiscussionThe results presented suggest that visible skin color distribution plays an important role insubjective evaluation of female facial beauty. Our investigation further indicates that peoplejudge female faces on other attributes in addition to facial shape and form. It was also foundthat males performed better with this task than females. To clarify this, we standardized thestimuli used in the present study with respect to their facial form and we removed information
relating to skin surface topography. Thus, they differed only with respect to the skin colordistribution from the original images. As significant variance was observed with visualperception of facial age and judgments of attractiveness, health, and youth, this signal,therefore, can only be due to changes in visible skin color distribution. The remarkably highcorrelations between estimated age and facial attributes suggest that human skin condition hasa signaling value independent of facial form and topography, probably indicating aspects ofan individual’s physiological condition, which are relevant for mate choice. Finally, it is alsoworthy of note that, as regards the high correlation between actual biological age and thatperceived in derived stimuli, the dynamic range of the estimated ages indicates that visiblefacial color distribution can account for up to 20 years of apparent age, independent of facialform and skin surface topography.
form and skin surface topography.There is evidence for an association between color display and mate choice in insects suchas butterflies ( Ellers & Boggs, 2003 ) and in fish ( Amundsen & Forsgren, 2001 ) and lizards(LeBas & Marshall, 2000 ). These studies demonstrated that males preferred less-melanised orbrightly colored females, suggesting that visual displays are intersexual signals resulting inmale mate choice of particular females. Evidence for the role of coloration can also be foundin studies using nonhuman primates. Waitt et al. (2003) report that female rhesus macaquespreferred males with red facial coloration by suggesting that male coloration may thusprovide a cue to male quality. Setchell, Wickings, and Knapp (2006) report an increase infacial coloration of female mandrills, proportional with age, and suggest that color may,therefore, signal reproductive quality. Knowledge about the potential signaling value of
human skin has been based mainly on speculation, although studies report some correlationbetween facial attractiveness and/or apparent health in males ( Jones, Little, Feinberg, et al.,2004; Jones et al., 2005 ) and females ( Fink et al., 2001; Jones, Little, Burt, et al., 2004 ).These studies, however, did not differentiate between skin surface topography and skin colordistribution. Our data indicate that the latter affects, to a significant degree, perception of age,attractiveness, and health in females. Two possible explanations for this phenomenon areconsidered below.B. Fink et al. / Evolution and Human Behavior 27 (2006) 433–442 438
Firstly, female body features are linked to age and reproductive condition, both of whichare presumed to correlate with a woman’s ratio of the hormones estrogen (E) to testosterone(T;Grammer et al., 2003; Symons, 1995 ). Attractive signals usually correspond to high E/Tratios. Recent evidence for this assertion is provided by Law Smith et al. (2006) who reportthat facial femininity, attractiveness, and apparent health are a cue to E levels in women and,by deduction, probably to reproductive health. Studies in dermatology have found arelationship between dermatoses (i.e., physiological and pathological changes of the skin) andan increase of the level of androgens in women (e.g., Held, Nader, & Rodriguez-Rigau,1984 ). Overproduction of androgens, with associated clinical manifestation of dermatoses, isoften due to a malfunction of the ovaries ( Schiavone, Rietschel, & Sgoutas, 1983 ).Consequently, some dermatoses may denote a disturbance in the balance of T and E and
reduced female reproductive ability and condition. Thus, information from the visible skinmay be crucial for male mate choice since phenotypic modifications seem to be closelyassociated with genetic constitution. Organisms with a higher resistance against parasites arethought to be favored in contests for a partner ( Grammer & Thornhill, 1994 ). A reducedimmune defense may also be responsible for higher susceptibility to parasites and pathogens,and this may be traced back via skin condition. The finding by Roberts et al. (2005) aboutMHC heterozygosity and the associated increase in ratings of healthiness of skin patchesprovides some support for this assertion since MHC genes code for proteins involved inimmune response.Secondly, besides such effects, which are clearly linked to hormonal status, visible skincondition is also subject to huge variation due to chronic photodamage as a result of
cumulative lifetime exposure to UVR in ordinary daylight, which results in undesirable skinchanges such as dryness, roughness, actinic keratoses, irregular pigmentation (freckling/lentigines), wrinkling, elastosis, loss of elasticity, dilated/tortuous surface blood vessels,blackheads (solar comedones), and sebaceous hyperplasia ( Boyd et al., 1995; Gilchrest, 1996;Taylor, Stern, Leyden, & Gilchrest, 1990 ). The incidence and severity of these skin changesare a function of cumulative solar UVR exposure as supported by human survey andexperimental data (e.g., Berg, 1989; Contet-Audonneau, Jeanmaire, & Pauly, 1999; Wlascheket al., 2001 ). In this present study, we have taken considerable care to specifically removephotoaging endpoints related to cutaneous form and topography from the final stimuli usedfor rating. It is possible, therefore, to predict with some confidence the origin of theconsiderable differences noted in the singl e, resulting variable—visible skin color
distribution. Importantly, all of the processes discussed above result in a significant increasein visible skin color unevenness and contrast that are probably responsible for the perceivedchanges in age, health, and beauty, independent of facial form and skin surface topography,reported in this study. It is clear, though, that future studies will be needed to identify andquantify the skin chromophores responsible for these visible effects.In summary, therefore, we suggest that studies on the perception of human physicalattractiveness need to consider the influence of facial skin color distribution and differentiatebetween such effects and other shape-related traits including skin surface topography. Thefinding that men reported a greater ease in the judgment of female faces was interesting, but itrequires further investigation before we can say whether they have developed some adaptiveB.

preferences for the evaluation of female attractiveness, health, and youth, which also relate toskin condition, or if this result merely indicates a male tendency to overestimate theirperceptual abilities.AcknowledgmentsSteven J.C.
