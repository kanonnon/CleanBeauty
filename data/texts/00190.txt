Green tea prevents non-melanoma skin cancer by enhancingDNA repairSantosh K. KatiyarBirmingham Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Birmingham, AL, and Department of Dermatology,Comprehensive Cancer Center and Nutrition Obesity Research Center, University of Alabama atBirmingham, Birmingham, AL, USAAbstractExcessive exposure of the skin to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation is one of the major factors forthe development of skin cancers, including nonmelanoma. For the last several centuries theconsumption of dietary phytochemicals has been linked to numerous health benefits including thephotoprotection of the skin. Green tea has been consumed as a popular beverage world-wide andskin photoprotection by green tea polyphenols (GTPs) has been widely investigated. In this article,we have discussed the recent investigations and mechanistic studies which define the potentialefficacy of GTPs on the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancer. UV-induced DNA damage,
particularly the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, has been implicated inimmunosuppression and initiation of skin cancer. Topical application or oral administration ofgreen tea through drinking water of mice prevents UVB-induced skin tumor development, and thisprevention is mediated, at least in part, through rapid repair of DNA. The DNA repair by GTPs ismediated through the induction of interleukin (IL)-12 which has been shown to have DNA repairability. The new mechanistic investigations support and explain the anti-photocarcinogenicactivity, in particular anti-non-melanoma skin cancer, of green tea and explain the benefits ofgreen tea for human health.KeywordsChemoprevention; contact hypersensitivity; cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers; green teapolyphenols; nucleotide excision repair; non-melanoma skin cancer; ultraviolet radiationIntroductionSkin cancer, including melanoma and non-melanoma, represents a major public health
problem as the incidence of skin cancer is equivalent to the incidence of cancers in all otherorgans combined [1]. It is also a major burden on the health care system as it has beenestimated that the cost of treating non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers in the UnitedStates is in billions dollar annually (www.cancer.org/statistics). The chronic exposure of theskin to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a major etiologic factor for initiation of skincancers. The depletion of the ozone layer that allows more solar UV radiation to reach at thesurface of the Earth, together with continuing increase in life expectancy and changingdietary habits and lifestyle appear to be contributing factors for the increasing risk ofcutaneous malignancies. Effective chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents andstrategies to address this issue and disease are urgently needed. One such strategy includes

the use of dietary phytochemicals, and it is becoming popular as a means to protect skindiseases including the risk of skin cancer.Naturally occurring phytochemicals, specifically phenolics, are widely distributed in plantfoods, including fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts, flowers and bark. Important dietary sourcesof polyphenols are grape seeds, grape skin, tea, apples, red wine, onions and cacao, etc. [2].These polyphenols possess beneficial health effects of dietary sources. Among the extensivestudied polyphenols, the green tea is better known for its health benefits in many organs aswell as in general health. In this review article, we particularly describe and discuss theprevention of non-melanoma skin cancer by green tea polyphenols with particular emphasison their DNA repair abilities in UV exposed skin.Green tea polyphenolsTea has been consumed as a popular beverage world-wide for the last thousands of years
because of its health benefits and pleasant aroma. Beverage grade commercial tea ismanufactured from the leaves of the plant Camellia sinensis  and is commercially availablemainly in three forms: green, black and oolong tea [2–4]. Of the total commercial teaproduction worldwide, about 78% is consumed in the form of black tea, mainly in westerncountries and some Asian countries, and 20% is consumed in the form of green tea. Greentea is largely consumed in some Asian countries like, Japan, China, Korea, parts of India anda few countries in North Africa and the Middle East [3,4]. The consumption of green tea isnow increasing in western countries including the United States because of increasingly newinvestigations on its health benefits and anti-carcinogenic activities in various organs.Approximately 2% of tea is consumed in the form of oolong tea, which is a partiallyfermented tea product, and largely consumed in some parts of South-eastern China [3,4].
The characteristic aroma and health benefits of tea are associated with the presence ofcatechin/epicatechin molecules and their derivatives, which are commonly called“polyphenols”. The major polyphenols present in green tea are: (–)-epicatechin, (–)-epigallocatechin, (–)-epicatechin-3-gallate and (–)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), andare shown in Figure 1.Studies have shown that polyphenols possess anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic activities in several in vitro  and in vivo  systems [5,6]. Of these majorpolyphenols, EGCG is the major component and the most effective molecule. EGCG hasbeen extensively studied in several disease models including its beneficial effects against theharmful effects of solar ultraviolet radiation. The polyphenols present in black tea are lesswell-defined and known as thearubigens and theaflavins. Investigations revealed thatthearubigins and theaflavins are also anti-carcinogenic in nature. The in vitro  cell culture
and in vivo  animal studies indicate that the polyphenols present in green tea ( abbreviated asGTPs: a mixture of green tea epicatechins or polyphenols) are better chemopreventiveagents than those present in black tea.SkinThe skin is the largest organ of the body and comprising a surface area of approximately1.5–2.0 m2 which protects the internal organs of the body against the detrimental effects ofenvironmental and xenobiotic agents. Thus skin provides a protective covering at this crucialinterface between inside and outside; and therefore is a physical barrier between the externalenvironment and internal tissues. Morphologically, skin is a composite of a variety of celltypes and organellar bodies, each of which has a particular function, and is made up ofseveral different layers, each with particular properties. The major layers include theepidermis and the dermis. The major cell type of the epidermis is the keratinocytes.
Keratinocytes comprise >90% of the cells of the epidermal layer. Other cell types are:Katiyar Page 2

Langerhans cells, melanocytes and γδ T cells. The dermal components of the skin, includingdermal fibroblast, microvasculature endothelial cells, dermal dendritic cells, mast cells, andresident perivascular T-cells, also participate in the cutaneous functions. These epidermaland dermal components have evolved into a dynamic network of interacting cells capable ofsensing a variety of perturbations including trauma, ultraviolet irradiation, toxicenvironmental chemicals, and pathogenic microorganisms in the cutaneous environment.Among many environmental and xenobiotic factors, the exposure of the skin to solar UVradiation is the key factor in the initiation of various skin disorders, such as wrinkling,hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation and skin cancer [7–9]. Statistically, the averageannual UV dose that an average American typically receive in a year is about 2,500–3,300mJ/cm2. An average female is exposed to an average 2,200 mJ/cm2 and males 2,800 mJ/cm2
each year with an additional exposure of about 800 mJ/cm2 of solar UVB radiation during aconservative vacation period [10,11].UV radiationSunlight is a major source of UV radiation. Solar UV spectrum is divided into three majorcomponents based on their wavelengths and biological effects [5,7]: (a) long-wave UVA(320–400 nm), (b) mid-wave UVB (290–320 nm), and (c) short-wave UVC (200–290 nm).The UV spectrum which reaches on the surface of the Earth consists of approximately 5%UVB and 95% UVA. Most of the UVC fraction of solar UV spectrum is blocked by theEarth’s stratospheric ozone layer. Solar UV radiation constitutes approximately 5% of theelectromagnetic spectrum that reaches the Earth’s surface. UVA comprises the largestspectrum of solar UV radiation ( ≈95%). UVA radiation can penetrate deeper into theepidermis and dermis of the skin. Extensive exposure of the skin to UVA can lead to benign
tumor formation [12,13]. Exposure of the skin to UVA induces the generation of singletoxygen and hydroxyl free radicals, which can cause damage to cellular macromolecules, likeproteins, lipids and DNA [14]. UVA-induced oxidative stress can enhance the process ofphotoaging in the form of skin sagging rather than wrinkling [15] and also can suppresssome immunological functions [16]. UVB radiations are mutagenic and carcinogenic innature and responsible for a variety of skin diseases. UVB radiation can penetrate insideepidermis of the skin and can induce oxidative stress, immunosuppression, DNA damage,premature aging of the skin and skin cancers including the melanoma and nonmelanoma[6,7]. UVC radiation have enormous energy and mutagenic in nature, and thereforecomparatively more harmful than UVA or UVB radiation.Multistage model of UV-carcinogenesisUV radiation, particularly UVB, can act as a tumor initiator [17], tumor promoter [18] and
co-carcinogen [19,20]. The process of UV-carcinogenesis can be divided into three distinctstages: initiation, promotion and progression (Figure 2). The tumor initiation stage is anirreversible process associated with the genotoxic damage of cellular DNA upon exposure toendogenous or exogenous carcinogens, such as UV radiation. In contrast, tumor promotionis a long-lasting reversible process characterized by clonal expansion of initiated cells toform a benign tumor with rapidly proliferating potential. This stage requires repeatedmultiple exposures of the UV radiation or any other tumor promoting agent, to give rise to abenign tumor. Tumor progression involves the transformation of the benign tumor into aninvasive and malignant tumor. Both UVA and UVB irradiation can act as a completecarcinogen. UVA is a relatively weak complete carcinogen than UVB because of its weakactivity as an initiating agent.Skin cancer is mainly divided into two major types of cancers, melanoma and

pigment called melanin. Depending on the type of cells, nonmelanoma skin cancers arefurther classified as, squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas. Nonmelanoma skin cancersrarely metastasize while melanoma cancer cells can metastasize to other parts of the body,and may lead to death. Most of the mortality occurs due to melanoma because of its abilityto metastasize to other organs. The incidence of melanoma has increased dramatically in thepast few decades in the United States [21,22], and is increasing rapidly in children [23].Nonmelanoma skin cancers can metastasize but much less often than melanoma, thereforemortality is rare. Protection from melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers requiresprotection from the exposure to solar UV radiation.Phytochemicals and skin cancerSince ancient time, natural products, herbs and spices have been used for preventing severaldiseases, including cancer. Since early in the history of medicine, an association between
diet and disease has persisted. Almost 25 centuries ago, Hippocrates, the father of modernmedicine, proclaimed “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food”. Approximately35 years ago, the National Cancer Institute initiated a Diet and Cancer Program to provideresearchers with the resources needed to better elucidate the role of dietary phytochemicalsin cancer prevention. The phytochemicals possessing anti-inflammatory,immunomodulatory and anti-oxidant properties are among the most promising group ofnatural products that can be exploited as ideal chemopreventive agents for a variety of skindisorders in general. Recent advances in our understanding at the cellular and molecularlevels of carcinogenesis have led to the development of promising strategies for thechemoprevention of cancers. Chemoprevention is a means of cancer control by the use ofspecific natural or synthetic chemical substances which can suppress, retard or reverse the
process of carcinogenesis, and thus offers a realistic strategy for controlling the risk of skindiseases. Studies have shown the chemopreventive potential of several phytochemicals, suchas green tea polyphenols, silymarin, retinoids, and grape seed proanthocyanidins, etc.against UV radiation-induced adverse effects, which include inflammation, oxidative stress,DNA damage and photocarcinogenesis [4,5,24,25]. Here, I will summarize and discuss therecent developments in the area of anti-photocarcinogenic potential of green tea polyphenolswith emphasis on prevention of UV-carcinogenesis through rapid repair of damaged DNA.Green tea inhibits non-melanoma skin cancerFollowing standard photocarcinogenesis protocols using SKH-1 hairless mice, it has beenfound that oral administration of GTPs in drinking water of mice resulted in significantprotection against the development of non-melanoma skin cancer in terms of tumor
incidence (percentage of mice with tumors), tumor multiplicity and tumor size compared tonon-GTPs-treated UVB-irradiated mice [26]. A water extract of green tea leaves, whichprimarily contained a mixture of polyphenolic ingredients, when given as the sole source ofdrinking water to mice afforded protection against UVB radiation-induced skintumorigenesis [27], and also promoted partial regression of established skin papillomas inmice [28]. Long-term oral administration or topical application of GTPs or EGCG did notshow signs of visible toxicity. Our laboratory developed a hydrophilic ointment basedformulation for the topical treatment of green tea polyphenols [29]. Treatment of SKH-1hairless mice with the topical formulation of EGCG resulted in exceptionally high protectionagainst photocarcinogenesis in terms of tumor incidence, tumor multiplicity and tumor size[29]. These results indicated that the use of EGCG with topical formulation might increase
the penetration or absorption capacity of EGCG inside the skin layers and the presence of
[29]. These results indicated that the use of EGCG with topical formulation might increasethe penetration or absorption capacity of EGCG inside the skin layers and the presence ofhigher concentration may be responsible for the higher photoprotection. The photoprotectiveeffects of GTPs or EGCG by topical treatment were greater than oral administration whichmay be due to presence of higher content of these polyphenols in topical application [30].Katiyar Page 4Arch Biochem Biophys .

Record and Dreosti [31] have shown that green tea can protect against both UVA and UVBradiation-induced skin cancer in mice. Experimental studies conducted in in vitro  and in vivomodels indicate that GTPs or EGCG prevent photocarcinogenesis following severalmechanisms which involve multiple molecular targets [5,6].Prevention of non-melanoma skin cancer by GTPs/EGCG requiresinterleukin (IL)-12UVB-induced immunosuppression has been implicated in non-melanoma skin cancer causedby UV irradiation, and topical treatment of EGCG inhibits UVB-inducedimmunosuppression in mice through the induction of IL-12, an immunoregulatory cytokine.It was hypothesized that prevention of non-melanoma skin cancer by EGCG may beassociated with the induction of IL-12 in mice. Topical application of EGCG resulted in asignificant reduction in UVB-induced skin tumor development compared to non-EGCGtreated wild-type mice. However, the treatment of IL-12 KO mice with EGCG did not
inhibit tumor development in these mice [32]. The analysis of tumor data indicates that micedeficient in IL-12 are at greater risk of UVB-induced carcinogenesis, and suggest that thechemopreventive effect of EGCG against skin cancer is mediated through the induction ofIL-12. Identical information were also observed when IL-12 KO and their wild-typecounterparts were given GTPs in drinking water of mice and subjected to UV-induced non-melanoma skin cancer protocol [33], suggesting that IL-12 is required for the anti-non-melanoma skin cancer effect of EGCG or GTPs.GTPs inhibit UVB-induced immunosuppressionThe immunosuppressive effects of solar UVB radiation are well established, most clearly bythe effects of UVB radiation in inhibiting contact hypersensitivity (CHS) response, which isa prototypic T-cell-mediated immune response [34]. Some of the adverse effects of solar UVradiation on human health, including exacerbation of infectious diseases and initiation of
skin cancer, are mediated at least in part by the ability of UV radiation to induceimmunosuppression [35–37]. Ample clinical and experimental evidence suggests that UV-induced immunosuppression is a risk factor for skin cancer in mice and probably in humansas well [38,39]. Chronically immunosuppressed patients living in regions of intense sunexposure experience an exceptionally high rate of skin cancer [40]. Therefore, the inhibitionof UV-induced immunosuppression can be considered as a potential strategy for managingskin cancer (summarized in Figure 3). In that context the effect of GTPs was examined onUVB-induced immunosuppression in C3H/HeN mice. Topical application of the mouse skinwith GTPs before UVB exposure resulted in significant protection against local andsystemic suppression of CHS response [41]. Among the four major epicatechin derivativespresent in GTPs, EGCG was found to be the most effective polyphenol affording protection
against UVB-induced suppression of CHS. In this study, topical treatment of GTPs or itsindividual epicatechin derivatives also resulted in inhibition of UV-induced inflammation,which suggests an association between the induction of inflammation and suppression ofCHS after UV irradiation of skin [41].UV-induced DNA damage: A molecular trigger for immunosuppression andnon-melanoma skin cancer/photocarcinogenesisExposure of the skin to UV radiation resulted in DNA damage or DNA photoproducts whichinitiates an important cascade of signaling pathways. The DNA photoproducts are alteredDNA structures that activate a cascade of responses, beginning with the initiation of cellcycle arrest and activation of DNA repair mechanisms. The biologically harmful effectsassociated with UV irradiation are largely the result of errors in DNA repair, which can leadKatiyar Page 5Arch Biochem Biophys .

to oncogenic mutations [ reviewed in  42]. UV-induced DNA damage in the form of thyminedimers or cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) is a molecular trigger for the induction ofimmunosuppression and initiation of photocarcinogenesis [43,44]. Studies have revealedthat exposure of the skin to UV radiation results in the formation of CPDs in skin cells [45].The formation of CPDs occurs immediately after the interaction of photons with the DNAmolecule.GTPs rapidly repair UVB-induced DNA damage in skin cellsTopical treatment of mouse skin with GTPs significantly inhibited UVB-induced DNAdamage as assessed using a 32P-postlabelling technique [46]. Similarly, topical treatment ofhuman skin with GTPs prior to UV exposure resulted in a dose-dependent repair of CPDs[47]. Camouse et al.  [48] found that topical application of green tea or white tea extractsprovided human skin protection from solar-simulated ultraviolet light. These tea extracts
were shown to provide protection against the detrimental effects of UV light on cutaneousimmunity. The investigators also concluded that these protective effects were not due todirect UV absorption or sunscreen effects. Studies on the effects of green tea polyphenols onthe DNA repair kinetics and repair mechanisms of UV-induced CPDs have been carried outusing in vitro  cell culture and in vivo  animal models as well as in human skin. Studiesshowed that topical treatment of skin with EGCG does not prevent UVB-induced CPDsformation immediately after UVB irradiation, which indicated that EGCG does not have asignificant sunscreen effect. However; in skin samples obtained at 24 h or 48 h after UVBexposure, the numbers of CPD-positive cells were significantly reduced (or repaired) in theEGCG-treated mouse skin compared to the control group of mice which were not treatedwith EGCG [49]. Studies of the DNA repair mechanisms suggested that the rapid repair of
UV-induced CPDs by EGCG was mediated through stimulation of IL-12 on application ofthe EGCG onto the mouse skin [49]. IL-12 is a 70-kDa heterodimeric protein composed oftwo disulfide-bonded chains, the p40 and p35 subunits [50,51]. IL-12 has been shown topossess potent antitumor activity in a wide variety of murine tumor models [52–54], and hasthe capacity to induce DNA repair [55–57] and this concept was verified by testing theeffect of EGCG on UV-induced CPD formation in IL-12 knockout mice. EGCG does notremove or repair UV-induced CPDs in the skin of IL-12 knockout mice but repaired in theskin of their wild-type counterparts, further confirming the role of IL-12 in rapid repair ofDNA damage by this polyphenol [49]. Studies on the effects of oral administration of GTPsin the drinking water of mice on UVB-induced DNA damage also were carried out and itwas found that UV-induced DNA damage in the form of CPDs was resolved rapidly in the
GTPs-treated mice compared to non-GTPs-treated mice [58]. Schwarz et al. [59] observedthat treatment of normal human keratinocytes and “human skin equivalent” with GTPsreduced UVB-induced DNA damage in the form of CPDs and that this effect was mediatedthrough the stimulation of IL-12 production. These investigations suggest that the differencein the GTPs-associated DNA repair capacity between IL-12 knockout mice and their wild-type counterparts may be due to the absence of IL-12 in the IL-12 knockout mice. Wei et al.[60] have shown that water extract of green tea scavenges H 2O2 and inhibits UV-inducedoxidative DNA damage in an in vitro  system. Zhao et al.  [61] demonstrated that applicationof green tea extract to Epiderm, a reconstituted human skin equivalent, also inhibitedpsoralen-UVA-induced formation of 8-methoxypsoralen-DNA adducts. Clifford et al. [62]have shown that EGCG or drinking green tea protects human cellular DNA from UV and
visible radiation-induced DNA damage, and also protect DNA damage in human peripheral
have shown that EGCG or drinking green tea protects human cellular DNA from UV andvisible radiation-induced DNA damage, and also protect DNA damage in human peripheralblood cells after tea ingestion. These observations demonstrate the potentialchemopreventive effects of green tea polyphenols against UVB-induced DNA damage.It also has been recognized that UV-induced DNA damage is an important molecular triggerfor the migration of antigen presenting cells (i.e., epidermal Langerhans cells) from the skinKatiyar Page 6Arch Biochem Biophys .

to the draining lymph nodes. DNA damage in antigen presenting cells impairs their capacityto present Ag, which in turn results in a lack of sensitization [53]. CPD-containing antigenpresenting cells have been found in the draining lymph nodes of UV-exposed mice [54].These antigen presenting cells were identified to be of epidermal origin and exhibited animpaired Ag presentation capacity. Since the treatment of EGCG induces IL-12 in mice[63], and IL-12 has the capacity to induce DNA repair [51,56,57], the effect of EGCG on themigration of CPD-positive cells from the UV-exposed skin to the draining lymph nodes wasstudied [64]. Immunohistochemical analysis of CPD-positive cells in lymph nodes after 36 hof UV irradiation revealed that the numbers of CPD-positive cells in the lymph nodes of theUV-exposed IL-12 KO mice being approximately 4-fold higher than in the lymph nodes oftheir wild-type counterparts. The lower numbers of CPD-positive cells in the lymph nodes
of UV-exposed wild-type mice compared to IL-12 KO mice may be attributable to thepresence of endogenous IL-12 in the wild-type mice at levels that are capable of partialrepair of the damaged DNA in the migrating cells. Treatment with EGCG resulted in asignificant reduction in the numbers of CPD-positive cells in the lymph nodes of UV-exposed wild-type mice compared to UV-exposed wild-type mice that did not receiveEGCG. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the number of CPD-positive cellsin the lymph nodes between EGCG-treated and non-EGCG-treated UV-exposed IL-12 KOmice. This observation supports the evidence that the reduction in the numbers of CPD-positive cells in the lymph nodes of wild-type mice after EGCG treatment may be due toEGCG-induced IL-12-mediated repair of CPD-positive cells.GTPs repair UVB-induced DNA damage through enhancement of nuclearexcision repair (NER) genes
excision repair (NER) genesIt has been shown that application of DNA repair enzymes that reduce the numbers of CPD-positive cells prevents UV-induced immunosuppression and incidence of skin cancer[44,65]. It was found that administration of GTPs in drinking water of mice has the ability toprevent UVB-induced immunosuppression in xeroderma pigmentosum complementationgroup A-positive ( XPA+/+) mice but not in XPA-deficient (XPA−/−) mice, which are devoidof NER genes and that is necessary for the repair of UV-induced DNA damage inmammalian cells. Therefore, further studies were conducted to examine whether the GTPs-mediated repair of UV-induced DNA damage requires NER gene. For this purpose, XPA+/+and XPA−/− mice were exposed to UVB with and without the treatment of mice with GTPsin drinking water, and mice were sacrificed 72 h later. In skin samples obtained fromXPA−/− mice, no significant difference in the staining pattern of CPDs was observed
whether or not they were treated with GTPs. In contrast, in UVB-exposed skin samplesobtained from XPA+/+ mice, the numbers of CPD+ cells were significantly lower in theGTPs-treated mice than those mice which were not treated with GTPs [66]. Further studieswere conducted to identify the DNA repair mechanism by GTPs in UVB-exposed cells. Todetermine whether the NER mechanism is required for the EGCG-enhanced repair of UVB-induced DNA damage, NER-deficient fibroblasts from a person suffering from xerodermapigmentosum complementation group A ( XPA) and NER-proficient fibroblasts from ahealthy person ( XPA-proficient) were exposed to UVB with or without prior treatment withEGCG. The data analysis of CPD-positive cells revealed that the numbers of CPD-positivecells were significantly lower in EGCG-treated group at 24 h after UVB exposure in theXPA-proficient cells compared to non-EGCG-treated cells. However, EGCG did not
significantly remove or repair UVB-induced CPDs in NER-deficient cells [66]. This in vitroobservation indicated that EGCG-induced DNA repair is mediated through a functionalNER mechanism.Katiyar Page 7

GTPs prevent UVB-induced immunosuppression in NER-proficient micebut not in NER-deficient miceAs the enhanced repair of UVB-induced DNA damage in the form of CPDs by GTPs maybe associated with the inhibition of UVB-induced immunosuppression in mice, it wasdetermined whether GTPs prevent UVB-induced immunosuppression in XPA-deficient(XPA−/−) mice which do not have the ability to repair UVB-induced DNA damage becauseof absence of functional NER genes [66]. For this purpose, XPA−/− and their wild-typecounterparts ( XPA+/+) were subjected to CHS protocol or experiment with and without thetreatment of GTPs in drinking water of mice. Following the CHS protocol, it was observedthat in the absence of treatment with GTPs, the CHS response was significantly lower inXPA−/− mice that were UVB-irradiated than those XPA−/− mice that were not UVB-irradiated, indicating the immunosuppressive effect of UVB radiation in XPA−/− mice. The
group of mice that were treated with GTPs in drinking water also exhibited a significantUVB-induced suppression of CHS response which was similar to non-GTPs-treated UVB-exposed mice. It suggests that administration of GTPs did not prevent UVB-inducedsuppression of CHS response to 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene, a contact sensitizer, in XPA−/−mice. In contrast, the administration of GTPs to the wild-type counterparts significantlyinduces contact sensitization reaction and ear swelling response to 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzeneand was significantly higher than those mice which were not given GTPs in drinking waterand exposed to UVB radiation [66]. The change in ear skin thickness in XPA−/− mice inresponse to 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene sensitization in GTPs +UVB was also compared to thechange in ear skin thickness in XPA+/+ mice in response to GTPs +UVB. The increase in earskin thickness after sensitization to 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene was greater in the XPA+/+ mice
treated with GTPs +UVB as compared to increase in ear skin thickness after sensitization tocontact sensitizer in XPA−/− mice treated with GTPs +UVB. These observations suggest thatprevention of UVB-induced immunosuppression by GTPs requires NER genes, which havea role in repair of UVB-induced DNA damage.Repair of UVB-induced DNA damage by GTPs leads to suppression ofinflammationUVB irradiation resulted in inflammation in the skin, and there is increasing evidence thatchronic inflammation promotes the development of skin cancers [ Reviewed in  9,14]. BothUV-induced inflammatory responses and UV-induced skin tumor development are causallyrelated to UV-induced DNA damage. Therefore, it was of interest to explore the effects ofgreen tea polyphenols on DNA repair and their relationship with inflammatory responses inthe skin. It is well known that CPDs are formed immediately after the exposure of the skin
to UV radiation, and inflammation develops at later stages. Following UV exposure, UV-induced DNA damage in the form of CPDs was repaired or removed more rapidly in theskin of mice that had been treated either with topical application of EGCG or administrationof GTPs in drinking water of mice. Subsequently, the levels of UVB-induced inflammationwere lowered in the treated mice than the non-treated mice. The levels of inflammation inthe mouse skin were assessed through analysis of biomarkers of inflammation, such ascyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, PGE 2 production and the levels of pro-inflammatorycytokines. In contrast, this effect of EGCG or GTPs was not observed in IL-12-deficientmice [58,64]. This may be due to the fact that the treatment of mice with EGCG or GTPswas not able to repair UV-induced DNA damage significantly in the absence of IL-12[64,66]. This information supports the concept that UV-induced CPDs and inflammatory
responses are causally related with the increased risk of photocarcinogenesis. This in vivoexperimental evidence indicates that the prevention of UVB-induced skin cancer by GTPs or
responses are causally related with the increased risk of photocarcinogenesis. This in vivoexperimental evidence indicates that the prevention of UVB-induced skin cancer by GTPs orEGCG is mediated through inhibition of UVB-induced inflammation, which in turn isKatiyar Page 8Arch Biochem Biophys .

mediated, at least in part, through rapid repair of damaged DNA. The outcome of the studiestherefore suggests that regular consumption of green tea or green tea polyphenols may beconsidered as an effective strategy for the prevention of inflammation-associated skindiseases including UV irradiation-caused skin tumor development.Inhibition of UVB-induced immunosuppression by GTPs is mediatedthrough enhancement of NER genesNER is the main mechanism of repair in mammalian cells for the removal of UV radiation-induced DNA damage. Since the treatment of GTPs enhances the removal or repair of UVB-induced DNA damage, it was of interest to examine whether the removal or repair of UV-induced CPDs by GTPs is mediated via induction of NER genes. Subsequent analysis ofdata reveals that treatment of mice with GTPs in drinking water of mice increases the levelsof some NER genes ( e.g., XPA, XPC  and RPA1 ) in UVB-exposed skin sites compared to
non-GTPs-fed mice and that may have contributed to the rapid repair of damaged DNA inmouse skin [66]. The role of NER was further confirmed by assessing the effect of GTPs onUVB-induced immunosuppression in XPA−/− mice and data were compared with the XPA+/+mice. Treatment of mice with GTPs in drinking water prevents UVB-induced suppression ofcontact hypersensitivity response in XPA+/+ mice but do not prevent in XPA−/− mice furthersupport the observations that inhibition of UVB-induced immunosuppression by GTPsrequire functional NER genes. This observation was important as the treatment of GTPs donot remove or repair UVB-induced DNA damage in XPA−/− (NER-deficient) mice butrepair in XPA+/+ (NER-proficient or wild-type) mice which were exposed to UVB. Theseobservations were further verified by using NER-deficient cells from XPA-patients andNER-proficient cells from healthy persons. Cells derived from patients suffering from
xeroderma pigmentosum either lack or have reduced DNA repair capacity due to geneticmutations in several components of the NER. The XPA complementation type represents themost severe phenotype, because the XPA gene is the most crucial component in the repairprocess and, thus, cells lacking the XPA gene are completely deficient in NER [67,68].Following these experiments, GTPs were able to remove UV-induced CPDs in NER-proficient cells but was not able to remove or repair in NER-deficient human fibroblast cells.These observations indicate that repair of UV-induced DNA damage by GTPs is mediatedthrough the NER mechanism or GTPs-induced DNA repair requires functional NER. Thesefindings have important implications for the chemopreventive mechanism of skin cancerprotection by GTPs, and identify a new mechanism by which GTPs prevent UV-inducedimmunosuppression.Together, the studies conducted with green tea polyphenols indicate that the prevention of
UV radiation-induced immunosuppression and subsequently the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancer by GTPs either through topical application or in drinking water ofmice are mediated through rapid repair of UVB-induced DNA damage, as summarized inFigure 3. As UV-induced DNA damage and immunosuppression play an important role innonmelanoma skin cancer, it is tempting to suggest that drinking green tea should be furtherinvestigated as a chemopreventive agent for the prevention of skin cancers in humans, andits possible use in future practice of medicine.Bioavailability and metabolism of green tea polyphenolsThe bioavailability and metabolism of phytochemicals may influence their effectiveness.Small molecules, like catechin monomers in green tea, can be easily absorbed through thegut barrier, whereas the large molecular weight polyphenols, such as (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate or polyphenols from black tea, are poorly absorbed. Once absorbed, polyphenols are
conjugated to glucuronide, sulfate and methyl groups in the gut mucosa and inner tissues.Katiyar Page 9

Non-conjugated polyphenols are virtually not found in plasma. As, the upper layer of theskin is stratum corneum, which is hydrophobic in nature, some vehicle are required foreffective penetration of the molecules inside the skin during topical application or treatment.Therefore, successful delivery of plant polyphenols requires cream-based, organic solvent-based or lipid soluble topical formulations that can enhance the penetration of thepolyphenols, and that will result in more efficient skin photoprotection. Mittal et al [29] usedhydrophilic cream-based topical formulation of EGCG for the protection of UVB-inducedskin carcinogenesis in mice. This hydrophilic cream-based formulation providesmoisturizing environment for a longer period of time to EGCG for its penetration inside theskin in addition to other ingredients which enhance the penetration ability of phytochemicalsinto the skin layers.Translation of animal studies to human system
Translation of animal studies to human systemThe photoprotective effects of polyphenols on UVB-induced DNA damage contribute to theprevention of non-melanoma skin cancer and act to abrogate the various biochemicalprocesses induced or mediated by solar UV radiation. Based on the epidemiologicalevidences and in vitro  and in vivo  laboratory studies, it is suggested that routineconsumption or topical treatment of skin with green tea polyphenols may provide efficientprotection against the harmful effects of solar ultraviolet radiation in humans. Based on theinformation obtained in animal models, it can be suggested that the regular consumption of5–6 cups of green tea (1 g green tea leaves/150 ml water =1 cup) per day by humans mayprovide the same level of photoprotective effect in human system as was observed in animalmodels. However, the magnitude of photoprotective effect in terms of UVB-induced
immunosuppression and DNA repair by green tea may differ person to person based on thedifferences in race, and intensity, exposure time and frequency of UV irradiation. Forappropriate conversion of chemopreventive agent doses from animal studies to humansystem, the body surface area normalization method has been prescribed [69]. The humanequivalent dose of any chemopreventive agent can be calculated using the followingformula:Further, the use of polyphenols in combination with sunscreens or skin care lotions mayprovide an effective strategy for mitigating the effects of UV radiation that will lead to theprevention of the skin from different skin diseases caused by excessive sun exposuresincluding the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer in humans.AbbreviationsCHS contact hypersensitivityCPD cyclobutane pyrimidine dimerIL interleukinGTPs green tea polyphenolsEGCG (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallateNER nucleotide excision repair
