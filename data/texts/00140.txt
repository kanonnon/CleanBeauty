DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2009.09453.xSummaryBackground Skin cancers represent a major challenge within the ever growing groupof long time surviving organ transplant recipients (OTR) world wide. EspeciallyUV-induced non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) like invasive squamous cell car-cinomas (SCC) and actinic keratoses (AK), and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), out-number every other form of cancer in organ transplant recipients. Despiteencouraging reports of protective effects of broad-spectrum sunscreens in immu-nocompetent patients, evidence for the prevention of NMSC in immunocom-promised patients is still missing.Objectives To assess preventive effects of regular sun-screen use on AK, SCC andBCC in chronically immunocompromised organ transplant recipients.Methods Hundred and twenty matched (age, sex, skin type, graft, transplant dura-tion, previous post-transplant skin malignancies) organ transplant recipients (40
heart, 40 kidney, 40 liver grafted) were recruited for this prospective, single-center study. Both groups received equally written and oral information on sunprotection measures. Sixty patients were provided with a free broad spectrumstudy-sunscreen (SPF > 50, high-UVA absorption) for daily application of2m gc m)2to the head, neck, forearms, and hands.Results All 120 patients completed the 24 months study. Within this 24 monthstudy interval 42 of the 120 patients developed 82 new AK ( )102 sun screengroup vs. + 82 control; P<0 Æ01), 8 new invasive SCC (0 vs. 8; P<0 Æ01) and11 BCC (2 vs. 9; ns). In spite of equal numbers of AK at baseline, a marked dif-ference in favor of the intent-to-treat sunscreen group was recorded after24 months (89 vs. 273; P<0Æ01, mean difference 3 Æ07 [1 Æ76–4 Æ36]) and thelesion count was signiﬁcantly lower as compared to the initial visit (89 vs. 191;P<0 Æ01, mean difference 1 Æ7[ 0 Æ68–2 Æ72]). With an average of 5 Æ6 applications
per week throughout the 24 months the study sunscreen was generally welltolerated. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels as marker for vitamin D statuswere decreased in all patients without adequate substitution and 25(OH)D wasfound to be lower in the sunscreen-group as compared to the control group

this growing patient group. The risk factors for the develop-ment of NMSC in OTRs include duration and intensity ofimmunosuppression, age, lighter skin type, and male gender.Whereas in temperate climates between 35% and 50% of OTRwill develop one or more skin cancers by the tenth year fol-lowing organ transplantation1this number may rise to morethan 80% in countries with a higher ultraviolet radiation(UV)-index such as Australia.2For long times the preventionof NMSC had low priority in the pre-transplant and earlypost-transplant period.3Since the average post-transplant sur-vival time is steadily increasing, the NMSC incidence will con-tinue to accelerate and hence require careful evaluation ofprimary and secondary prophylaxis in this group.4,5In immunosuppressed as well as in immunocompetentpopulations, AK and SCC, but also BCC, are mainly localizedon sun-exposed areas (face, neck, trunk, hands).6,7Highlight-
6,7Highlight-ing the crucial impact of UVR on the development of NMSC,even in OTR the non-UVR exposed skin stays remarkably clearfrom NMSC.While initiating and promoting NMSC, ultraviolet radiation(UVR) has a well-established role as a complete carcinogen.8Although childhood and adolescent UVR exposure have beenidentiﬁed as key factors for the induction of malignant mela-noma and, to a lesser degree NMSC, the incidence of SCCincreases with age and is causally related to the cumulative aswell as recent UVR-exposure.9,10Against a background ofsystemically impaired immunosurveillance, the cumulativeexposure to UVR represents the dominant risk factor forNMSC in OTR.11,12Resolute use of sunscreen has been shown to reduce theincidence of AK13,14and cutaneous invasive SCC15in immuno-competent subjects.Consequently, in OTRs all primary prevention measureshave emphasised the importance of daily sunscreen use as partof the UVR-protection measures (Table 1).
Multiple studies have shown poor compliance rates regard-ing consequent sun protection among OTR.3,16–18Reasonsgiven for not using sunscreens are manifold. They reach fromlack of knowledge regarding the harmful effects of UVR,ﬁnancial inability to afford high-quality sunscreens, to ﬁndingsunscreens too expensive, cosmetically unacceptable (greasy,comedogenic, difﬁcult to rub in) or impractical in the socialenvironment (whitening effect). Potentially most important isthe fact that immunosuppressant drugs, especially calcineurineinhibitors, mTOR-inhibitors and c orticosteroids induce sebaceousgland hyperplasia, folliculitis, acne, and a socially disturbingwhitening effect. Such factors undermine the motivation ofthe OTR towards using sunscreens.In this study, we examined the effect of the regular use ofsunscreen on the incidence of new actinic keratoses, invasivesquamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma in organtransplant recipients presenting during 24 months.
Materials and methodsApproval for the study was obtained from the ethics committeeof the Charite ´Universita ¨tsmedizin, Berlin, and the study wasconducted in compliance with current US and EU regulations.Study objectivesTheprimary objective of this consecutive study was to compareregular and application of a highly protective sunscreen versusreinforced but self-responsible translated sun-protection withrespect to prevention of AK, invasive SCC and BCC.Three outcome variables were identiﬁed for the study: thetotal number of AK in the study area (head, neck, dorsum ofthe hands and forearms). The number of new AK lesionsappearing or disappearing during the study, and the incidenceof new invasive SCC and BCC during the study period.Asecondary objective was to compare skin infections (HPV-induced vulgar warts, herpes virus simplex, dermatomycoses)and acneiforme skin conditions as a result of chronic applica-tion of sunscreen lotion.

been transplanted <1 year ago, 7 received their transplantbetween 1 and 5 years prior of entering the study and 7patients were 7 or more years post transplant. Males andfemales of each subgroup were equally matched. All patientshad Fitzpatrick’s skintype II or III. An equally sized andmatched group (age, sex, time post transplantation, graftedorgan, previous posttransplant malignancies including similarnumbers of AK) was identiﬁed from our database andrecruited as the control group (Table 3). Inclusion and exclu-sion criteria are shown in Table 4.The type of immunosuppression was comparable in thesunscreen and control arms of all three groups and consisted
of cyclosporine, mycophenolate or azathioprine and predniso-lone in the heart transplant group, tacrolimus, mycophenolateand prednisolone in the kidney group, and a tacrolimus basedregimen in the liver transplant group. All patients remainedon their type of immunosuppression during the whole24 months of observation. Dose adjustments, if at all, werenot related to the occurrence of NMSC but mainly related tomedical needs such as graft function.SunscreenThe study sunscreen was a water resistant cream lotion con-taining the ﬁlters bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl tri-azine, ethylhexyl triazone, isoamyl p-methoxycinnamate,ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate and methylene bis-benzotriazol-yl tetramethylbutylphenol, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane(Daylong actinica/C210; Spirig Pharma Ltd., Egerkingen, Switzer-land). It is rated as ‘very high protective’ according to the EUcommission recommendation (26 ⁄9⁄2006) notiﬁed underdocument number C(2006)4089. The labeled category ‘very
high protective’ corresponds to a measured sun-protection-fac-tor (SPF) > 60 for UV-B. According to the Australian Stan-dards (AS ⁄NZS 2604–1997) the product delivers a good UV-Aprotection.Study proceduresAfter individual informed consent patients were examined andinterviewed regarding previous skin diseases and especiallyNMSC. Lesions in the study areas (head, neck arms back ofthe hands, and lower forearm), clinically identiﬁed as AK werecounted. Biopsies were taken out of any hyperkeratotic AK(AK III) or lesions with clinical suspect of invasiveness (SCC,BCC). All conﬁrmed AKIII, invasive SCC and BCC were surgi-cally removed. Any lesion treated during the course of thestudy was rated positive till the end of the 24 months obser-vational phase.Patients in the sunscreen and in the control group received
the same oral and written information on sun-related skincancers and sun-protection measures, including the use ofsunscreen. They were advised to keep out of the sun from11:00 to 14:00 h, wear UVR-proof hats or caps and longTable 3 Summary statistics at enrolmentMeasurement at enrolmentGroupControl Sun screenInitial actinic keratoses 191 191Mean (± SD) 3 Æ23 (3 Æ659371) 3 Æ18 (3 Æ42)Range 0–12 0–11Prior invasive SCC 6 7Prior invasive BCC 6 6Table 4 Inclusion and exclusion criteriaInclusion criteria Exclusion criteriaPatients of either sex aged ‡40 years Invasive or immediate pre-invasive (AK III) skin tumours attime of study inclusionOrgan-transplant recipients who received a liver,kidney or heart transplantMulti-organ transplantationPatients or legal representatives who are able tounderstand and provide written informed consent toparticipate in the clinical investigation(signed informed consent)Evidence of systemic infection, excluding viral hepatitis,

sleeved shirts and trousers (Table 1). In the sunscreen groupall patients were provided with unlimited free sunscreen dur-ing the entire observation period and were advised and trainedto apply 2 mg cm)2lotion on the face and neck and back oftheir hands, and lower forearm as well as other sun-exposedparts of their skin 20–30 minutes before leaving the house forthe ﬁrst time of the day. At each visit patients of both groupswere interviewed about their sun protective behavior includ-ing the frequency of sunscreen use, textile UV-protection andoutdoor behavior. Patients of the sunscreen group also docu-mented this data in a diary. All patients presented every6 months (March–April and September–October) for theirclinical evaluation and interview and disposal of new doses ofstudy sunscreen for the intend-to-treat arm. The examinationswere done by a team of three experienced dermatologists. Incase of occurrence of new skin lesions the patient presented atunscheduled visits.
Statistical analysisContinuous data were compared by the t-test andANOVA in SPSS14.0 (SPSS GmbH Software, Mu ¨nchen, Germany). If distribu-tional assumptions were in doubt nonparametric test wereused. Categorical values were compared with Fisher’s exact test.AP-value of < 0 Æ05 was considered signiﬁcant.ResultsActinic keratosesAll patients completed the 24 months study phase. Withinthe 24 month study interval 42 of the 120 patients devel-oped 82 new AK and 102 AK (all in the sunscreen group)went into spontaneous remission. The lesion count was sig-niﬁcantly lower ( )102 sun-screen group vs. plus 82 control;P<0Æ01, mean difference 3 Æ07 [2 Æ47–3 Æ65]). 3 of the 60
patients in the sunscreen group had up to two additional(and newly developed) AK at the 12 months visit, but theselesions regressed within the following 12 months until theﬁnal visit without speciﬁc therapy applied. Altogether theincidence of new AK after 24 months was signiﬁcantly lowerin the intent-to-treat sunscreen group as compared to thecontrol group (89 vs. 273; P<0 Æ01, mean difference 3 Æ07[1Æ76–4 Æ36]) and signiﬁcantly lower as compared to thelesion count recorded in the initial visit (89 vs. 191;P<0Æ01, mean difference 1 Æ7[0Æ68–2 Æ72]) (Fig. 1). In thesunscreen group an overall reduction of 53% in AK numbersas compared to initiation visit was observed after 24 months.In the control group the AK numbers overall increased by43%.The highest numbers of AK were found in the highlyimmunocompromised heart transplant group (189 lesions at
the pre study visit), followed by kidney (150) and liver (43)transplant recipients. However, there was a remarkabledecrease of AK in sunscreen groups of all three transplantpopulations. In the heart transplant recipients sun-screen-groupthe numbers decreased form 93 lesions pre study to 81 at12 months (13% reduction, mean difference 0 Æ6,P[ns]) to 40after 24 months of resolute sunscreen use (56% reduction,mean difference as compared to baseline 2 Æ65,P=0Æ03). Sim-ilar effects were observed in the sun-screen groups of thekidney [76 AK pre visit, 62 (18% reduction) after 12 months,41 (46%) after 24 months; P= ns] and liver transplant recipi-ents [22 pre visit, 15 (32%) after 12 months, 8 (64% reduc-tion) after 24 months] ( P= 0, 1 [ns]).In the control group; however, the numbers of AK steadilyrose throughout the study, reaching an increase of 28% (96AK pre study, 123 AK at 24 months) in the heart transplant
group after 24 months. In the kidney transplant group the AKnumbers in the deﬁned study area increased by 51% (74 AKpre study, 112 AK post study) and in the liver grafted controlgroup by 81% (21 AK pre study vs. 38 post study).Squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinomaTwenty ﬁve out of the 120 patients taking part in this study
Squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinomaTwenty ﬁve out of the 120 patients taking part in this studyhad invasive NMSC (Table 3) in their post transplant historybefore entering the study (13 BCC, 12 SCC). 19 new invasiveNMSC (BCC, SCC) were found in 22 patients during the24 months study phase. In the sun-screen group no new inva-sive SCC occurred whereas in the control group patients devel-oped eight new invasive SCC (5 in heart transplanted patients,3 in kidney and none in liver transplant recipients) (0 vs. 8;P<0Æ01) (Fig. 2).In contrast to the highly signiﬁcant difference in the pro-portion of patients with newly developed SCC the incidenceof BCC was less striking. The sun-screen group patients devel-oped 2 new BCC whereas in the control group the patientsdeveloped 9 new BCC (2 vs. 9; P= ns) (Fig. 3). one of thenew BCC in the sun-screen-group developed in liver and onein a kidney transplant recipients. In the control group 3 new
BCC were found in liver, 4 in kidney and 2 in heart transplantrecipients.

Adverse effectsIn both groups (sunscreen and control) acne or increased seb-orrhea as potential side effects of application of sun screens(study sun screen or individually purchased sun screen) wasreported. Twelve out of 60 patients in the sunscreen groupoccasionally complained about seborrhea and acne, which wasusually very variable throughout the study and mostly man-ageable with increased cleansing of the facial skin in the even-ing. Acne (two patients) and seborrhea of the face was alsoreported in 7 out of 60 patients in the control group, showingthe usual side effects of calcineurin inhibitors and corticoster-oids in OTR. In the sunscreen group, there was a non-signiﬁ-cant trend towards less human papilloma virus induced wartson the dorsum of the hands and lower arms. However, sincea proportion of warts also occurred on palmar and plantarsoles or other not typically sun-exposed areas of the skin, theywere not analysed in a more detailed way within this study.
There was no difference between the groups in connectionwith further infectious skin diseases including herpes simplex,herpes zoster or dermatomycoses.DiscussionUV radiation is the major environmental cause for non-mela-noma skin cancer. An increased cumulative lifetime dose ofsun exposure is associated with the increased risk of AK andinvasive SCC.5,19AK were previously described as serving as a‘dosimeter’ for the life time sun-exposure and representing amajor risk factor for subsequent skin cancer.1,10,14,18Organtransplant recipients have particularly high rates of actinickeratoses and squamous cell carcinoma with a relative risk~100- fold higher than that in the immunocompetent popu-lation.1993Æ5% of all squamous cell carcinomas occur in thetypical ‘sunny terraces’ of the body, mainly head, neck, dor-sum of the hands and forearms.3Whereas in immunocompe-tent patients, only ~10% of individual lesions of actinickeratosis advance to invasive squamous cell carcinoma during
a 5- to 10-year time frame, in OTR the rate of progression ofactinic keratosis is apparently accelerated (months) and theincidence of progression higher (> 20–30%).20Sunscreens can inhibit the formation of actinically inducedneoplastic lesions. They are able to reduce the prevalence ofactinic keratoses and recurrent SCC in immunocompetentpatients.13–15Assuming the same in an setting of systemicimmunosuppression, sun avoidance strategies including therecommendation of a daily use of sun screen is included in allguidelines for skin cancer prevention in OTR.5,21Non-melanoma skin cancerUp to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to document thatregular application of sunscreen has a preventive impact onthe development of NMSC in the high risk-group of organ
transplant recipients. Whereas during the 24 month studyinterval 42 of the 120 patients developed new AK, the totalnumber of AK at the 24 months visit decreased by 102 in theintend-to-treat sun screen group. The control group, equallyinformed about the importance and applicable techniques ofsun protection measures, however, showed a signiﬁcantincrease of 82 lesions in the same time ( P<0Æ01). It has beenreported in the past that AK may spontaneously remit if sun-light exposure is reduced.22Even transplant patients often pre-sented with lesions whose onset or worsening was noticedduring the summer, suggesting that the lesions may becomemore active following sunlight exposure. Studies examiningthe effect of UVR mediated alteration of the epidermalimmune surveillance mediated by Langerhans cells couldpartly explain this seasonal variation.23These ﬁndings mayindicate remaining capacities of the cutaneous immune surveil-
lance in the clearance of early forms of epithelial dysplasia inthe absence of UVR even in OTR.The rationale for treating and preventing AK is to prevent

In our study, eight new invasiveSCC developed in the control group whereas patients in thesunscreen group remained free of new SCC. Though the over-all incidence rates were small, these ﬁndings were statisticallysigniﬁcant ( P<0Æ01).

Australian Nambour Skin Cancer Trial on 1383 immunocom-petent subjects, showing a signiﬁcantly lower incidence ofSCC in the group with daily use of sun screen.15Out of the 60 patients in the sun screen group 2 developeda new BCC during the time of the study. In the control armwe detected nine new BCC. Though, the results indicate abeneﬁt in favor of the sunscreen group, the results where notstatistically signiﬁcant. Generally, basal cell carcinomas are‘only’ increased by a factor of 10 in organ transplant recipi-ents. A possible explanation for our ﬁndings could be, thatinfrequent intense exposure to UVR may have a greater impacton increasing the risk of BCC compared with the total cumula-tive UV exposure.24However, further studies or a longer fol-low-up is needed to elucidate a signiﬁcant impact of sunprotection and basal cell carcinoma dynamic.SunscreensSunscreens are topical preparations that attenuate the effects ofUV radiation on the skin. The poor compliance among OTR
with advised sun protection measures and especially sunscreen use has been shown before.16,17,25When evaluatingthe reasons given by those patients denying regular sunscreenuse despite the knowledge of the deleterious effects of UVradiation, two main groups of ‘excuses’ usually arise. Thelargest group describes sunscreens as ‘cosmetically and sociallyunacceptable’. Indeed, the physical inorganic ﬁlters (titaniumor zinc oxide), which are the protective compounds in somebroad-spectrum sunscreens recommended to organ transplantrecipients, have a more greasy ‘feel’.26,27They are difﬁcult toapply and are not recommendable for oily skin or for skinwith acne. The latter aspect might be even especially impor-tant for OTR since cyclosporine induces sebaceous glandhyperplasia, leading to a seborrhoic skin and acne. Steroids,and also newer immunosuppressive agents such as everolimusand sirolimus (mTOR-inhibitors), are also able to induce or
promote acne. Patients therefore usually try to avoid or reduceapplication of any additional fatty emollients to their facewhich frequently also includes sunscreens. Optimized formula-tions for these patients, such as gels or liposomal lotions, areless greasy and likely to be more cosmetically acceptable. Withan average of 5 Æ6 application out of 7 application days perweek, the acceptance and compliance with our liposomalstudy sunscreen lotion was excellent. Since only a correctlyapplied sunscreen has a chance to protect the individual, cos-metic preference of a patient plays a frequently underestimaterole.The second reason given for non-complying with theadvised use of sunscreen, are the costs of high quality sunscreens. Many of our patients had to retire early due to theirtransplant or the prolonged time on the transplant-waiting listand are not doing too well ﬁnancially. Health insurance com-
panies still consider all sunscreens to be ‘cosmetic’ products.Consequently, they are not reimbursed even for patients athigh risk of skin cancer, such as organ transplant recipients.Interestingly, a recent study proofs regular sun screen use as acost–effective approach to skin cancer prevention in a subtrop-ical setting, which may serve as a calculational example forother NMSC risk-groups too.28Protective measures with tex-tiles, hats and sun avoidance are primary precautions for OTR.Since sun screens are recommended for those parts of thebody which are not sufﬁciently protected by textiles, the dailycosts originating from sun screen use are therefore limited.With an average of 5 Æ6 out of 7 applications per week yearround for a total of 24 months in the sunscreen group, thecompliance and acceptance of the study sunscreen was excel-lent. Patients in the control group typically applied sunscreenif directly exposed to UVR, mostly related to recreational
if directly exposed to UVR, mostly related to recreationalactivities in summer months. The year round average sun-screen application frequency in the control group was lessthan once per week (0 Æ3 days). Furthermore (97%) of thesunscreen- and (84%) of the control group patients reportedto trying to keep out of the midday sun on a sunny day.Vitamin DSun protection can decrease pre-vitamin D3 synthesis in skinand the question about the importance of optimal vitamin Dlevels for general health is currently a hot topic both in popu-lar press and in the scientiﬁc literature and is discussed byReichrath et al.in another article of this supplement. On theother hand, excessive sun exposure may also have unwantedside effects on vitamin D metabolism: vitamin D synthesis ismaximal at suberythemal UV doses and further UV exposureonly increases the conversion of pre-vitamin D3 to lumisteroland tachysterol, both biologically inert compounds.29Further-
29Further-more, continued sun exposure degrades the active form of thephotolabile vitamin D3.30In our study, vitamin D levels werenot measured prospectively in all patients. However, at24 months, patient-data of the past 30 months was collectedfrom transplant centres and values measured from frozenserum samples were used to amend missing data in somepatients. Serum 25(OH)D levels, as marker for vitamin Dstatus, were decreased in the obtainable values of patientswithout adequate substitution (normal range: 15 Æ0–90Æ0n gm L)1). With mean values from 53 ng mL)1in thesunscreen and 60 ng mL)1in the control group, we were notable to reconﬁrm lower levels of 10 Æ9n gm L)125(OH)Dassociated with rigorous sun protection in 31 renal transplantrecipients in a recent publication.31Anyhow, we would
strongly advise to interdisciplinary monitor Vitamin D levelsof all patients with regular sun protection and especially OTR.If not already performed by the transplant-internists, derma-tologists should advise oral substitution of vitamin Ddeﬁciency as previously described.29,32ConclusionSkin cancer remains a signiﬁcant challenge for dermatologistsin the management of organ transplant recipients.

population in which to study the potential of preventive andtherapeutic measures. Sunscreens, as part of a conclusive sunprotection strategy, are an important pillar of preventivehealthcare. Our ﬁndings lend support to the hypothesis thatintensiﬁed use of cosmetically acceptable, highly protectivesun screens in combination with educational programs andbehavioural changes may reduce the increased risk for devel-oping distinct forms of non-melanoma skin cancers in aNMSC-high-risk patient population. We conclude that for allindividuals with an increased risk of skin cancer developmentsun protective measures including highly protective sunscreenmust be employed throughout their life.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Nicole Deter for assistance with patient and datamanagement and administration of study-records.References1 Berg D, Otley CC.
