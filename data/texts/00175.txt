Sulforaphane potentlyinduces transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated expressionof detoxiﬁcation, anti-oxidation, and immune system-modulating enzymes, and possibly acts asan anti-carcinogenic agent. Several clinical trials are in progress to study the effect of diverse typesof cruciferous vegetables and sulforaphane on prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, atopicasthmatics, skin aging, dermatitis, obesity, etc. Recently, the protective effects of sulforaphane onbrain health were also considerably studied, where the studies have further extended to several
neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s dis-ease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia.Animal and cell studies that employ sulforaphane against memory impairment and AD-relatedpre-clinical biomarkers on amyloid- β, tau, inﬂammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegenerationare summarized, and plausible neuroprotective mechanisms of sulforaphane to help prevent AD arediscussed. The increase in pre-clinical evidences consistently suggests that sulforaphane has a multi-faceted neuroprotective effect on AD pathophysiology. The anti-AD-like evidence of sulforaphaneseen in cells and animals indicates the need to pursue sulforaphane research for relevant biomarkersin AD pre-symptomatic populations.Keywords: sulforaphane; Alzheimer’s disease; memory; amyloid- β; tau; inﬂammation; oxidativestress; neurodegeneration1. History of Sulforaphane Research in Brain Health
Sulforaphane (1-isothiocyanato-4-methylsulfonylbutane) is a potent dietary bioactiveagent obtainable from cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, watercress, kale, cabbage,collard greens, brussels sprouts, bok choy, mustard greens, and cauliﬂower [ 1]. In crucifer-ous vegetables, sulforaphane is present as its precursor glucosinolate glucoraphanine [ 2].When the tissues of cruciferous plants are processed by cutting, cooking, freezing, ormastication, glucoraphanine and an enzyme called myrosinase in the cruciferous veg-etables are exposed to each other, which removes the glucose moiety on glucoraphanineand hydrolyzes glucoraphanine to sulforaphane [ 3].β-Thioglucosidases occurring in thehuman gastrointestinal microbiome also convert precursor glucoraphanine into bioactivesulforaphane [4].The study of the pharmacological effects of sulforaphane and cruciferous plants wasstarted in 1992 by Zhang, Y. et al. [ 5]. They conﬁrmed in rodent tissues that sulforaphane

They conﬁrmed in rodent tissues that sulforaphaneinduces the expression of phase II detoxiﬁcation enzymes, such as NAD(P)H:(quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione S-transferases, indicating the possibil-ity contributing to the detoxiﬁcation mechanism of carcinogens and showing the possibilityof chemoprevention [ 5]. Thereafter, the pharmacological potential of sulforaphane andcruciferous vegetables has been studied and published not only in cancer, but also inmetabolic diseases, Helicobacter pylori infection, the nervous system, the cardiovascularInt.

According to clinicaltrials.gov, clinical trialsof 159 conditions to study the effects of sulforaphane on human health and diseases havebeen conducted or are in progress. In 1994, structural analogues of sulforaphane weresynthesized, but none showed superior activity compared to sulforaphane [ 6], and no caseswere applied to clinical studies.The study on the neuroprotective effects of sulforaphane began in 2004 with studiesshowing the protective effects on neurons [ 7] and microglia [ 8] against oxidative stress viathe activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), the transcription factorto induce the expression of detoxiﬁcation, anti-oxidation, and immune system-modulatingenzymes. Sulforaphane-induced hormetic activation of Nrf2 provides the possibility ofreducing the wide range of human-related neurological pathologies in the experimental
disease models on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [ 9], Parkinson’s disease [ 10], Huntington’sdisease [ 11], amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ 12], multiple sclerosis [ 13], autism spectrumdisorder (ASD) [ 14], and schizophrenia [ 15]. Now, sulforaphane studies are extendedto various mechanisms via or not via Nrf2 and suggest the possibility of preventingor treating neurological diseases. Small-scale human clinical trials were conducted inpatients with ASD and schizophrenia, and sulforaphane treatment reversed cognitive andbehavior abnormalities that have been associated with ASD and schizophrenia [ 16–20].In addition, the safety and efﬁcacy of sulforaphane as an adjuvant to risperidone, anatypical antipsychotic agent, has recently been studied and no severe adverse events butimproved irritability and hyperactivity symptoms in children with ASD were observed [ 21].These ﬁndings suggest the possibility that sulforaphane reverses cognitive and behavior
abnormalities in AD without severe adverse events. According to clinicaltrials.gov, there isa clinical trial underway in China using sulforaphane in patients with prodromal to mildAD (NCT04213391).2. Evidence of Anti-AD Activity of Sulforaphane in Animals and CellsAlzheimer’s disease is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease that currentlyhas no effective treatment. The most discernible pathology that can identify AD is the extra-cellular formation of plaques produced by the accumulation of amyloid- β(Aβ) protein [ 22],and the formation of intraneuronal neuroﬁbrillary tangles made of hyperphosphorylatedand truncated tau proteins in cortical neurons [ 23]. These pathologies are known to occurdecades before symptoms of AD appear [ 24]. Accumulation of A βand hyperphospho-rylated and truncated tau proteins causes oxidative and inﬂammatory damage to braintissue, which harms the function of neuronal synapses and induces neuronal degeneration,
ultimately leading to symptoms of memory loss seen in AD [24].Since there is no suitable treatment for AD, the overall goal of AD management is toreduce the incidence of disease in the target population and to ensure pre-symptomaticdisease does not proceed to a later stage [ 25]. Several biomarkers are being studied to diag-nose the likelihood of developing a disease early in the disease process, where preventionor treatment will be most effective, and to monitor a patient’s response to prevention andtreatment [ 26]. Based on the biomarkers currently being studied for clinical practice [ 27–30],pre-clinical biomarkers (1) A β, (2) tau, (3) inﬂammation, (4) oxidative stress, (5) neurode-generation, as well as (6) cognitive impairment were selected to investigate the pre-clinicalanti-AD evidence of sulforaphane, and its effectiveness and plausible mechanisms.

characteristics of the AD-like cells and animal models cited in this review are described indetail in Table 1. Studies on transgenic mice [ 31–35] or cells carrying the gene mutationsassociated with AD [ 9,34], and animal models [ 36,37] or cells treated with A β[32,35,38–43]were reviewed (Tables 2–6).

Sulforaphane and A βSulforaphane has been found to prevent A βproduction in the brains of AD-like animalmodels (Table 2). In the brains of PS1 V97L mice, single-mutant transgenic model harboringPS1 V97L, as described in Table 1, sulforaphane treatment decreased the expression of β-secretase (BACE1) and presenilin-1 (PS-1), which are involved in the sequential proteolyticcleavage of amyloid- βprotein precursor (A βPP) to A βpeptides [ 32]. In the study withthese mice, sulforaphane inhibited the generation of all types (monomer, trimer, tetramer,hexamer, nonamer, and dodecamer) of A βoligomers [ 32], which may be associated with
the inhibition of BACE1 and PS-1 expression. In another study, depletion of Nrf2 increasesBACE1 and a BACE1 mRNA-stabilizing antisense RNA (BACE1-AS) expression and A βproduction and worsens cognitive deﬁcits, and suggesting that sulforaphane-mediatedNrf2 activation decreases BACE1 and BACE1-AS expression and A βproduction andameliorates cognitive deﬁcits in 5 ×FAD and 3 ×Tg-AD mice [ 31]. On the other hand,kinetics and computational studies on direct sulforaphane effect on BACE1 showed thatsulforaphane has selective and non-competitive BACE1 inhibitory activity [48].Table 2.

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 2929 6 of 16deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and 3 [ 35]. p75 NTR has been reported to be signiﬁcantly reducedin the brains of AD patients [ 50,51] and p75 NTR-ectodomain has been reported to reducelocal A βplaques in APP/PS1 mice [52].In the hippocampus of 3 ×Tg-AD mice, oral gavage of sulforaphane reduced themonomeric and polymeric forms of A β[34]. In this animal model, it was found thatsulforaphane treatment increased the levels of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and theC-terminus of HSP70-interacting protein (CHIP), previously reported to inﬂuence A βmetabolism [ 53], and the sulforaphane-mediated reduction in A βwas dependent on CHIPexpression, suggesting that sulforaphane clears the monomeric and polymeric forms of A βby upregulating CHIP [ 34]. Even in primary cortical neurons derived from 3 ×Tg-AD mice,sulforaphane increased CHIP and decreased A β[34]. In addition to that, sulforaphane
treatment in mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells expressing APPswe decreased the levels ofAβs in both the cells and the culture medium [9].Aβaggregation studies with sulforaphane showed that A βis less prone to aggregatewhen sulforaphane is present [ 49]. Mass spectrometry experiments suggested a possiblemechanism for sulforaphane’s effects, by showing that sulforaphane binds to free NH 2groups (N-terminal amino acid and lysines) in A βand forms three different 1:1 complexesof Aβ+sulforaphane [49].Together, the above observations suggest that sulforaphane not only inhibits A βpro-duction by decreasing the expression of BACE1 and PS1 [ 32] but also clears A βmolecules byinducing the expression of the HSP co-chaperone CHIP [ 34]. Sulforaphane-mediated activa-tion of the Nrf2/ARE pathway negatively regulates BACE1 expression [ 31]. Sulforaphane-mediated upregulation of the p75 NTR at least in part through decreased expression of
HDAC 1 and 3 may also contribute to reduce the increase in A βplaque [ 35]. Although fur-ther investigations are required, sulforaphane has the potential to inhibit A βaggregationby binding directly to A βin the brains of AD patients [49].2.2. Sulforaphane and TauTau is the main component of neuroﬁbrillary tangles in AD and is a causative factorfor AD [ 54,55]. Sulforaphane showed the ability of reducing protein levels of tau [ 34] andp-tau [ 31,32,34] in 3×Tg-AD and PS1 V97L mice. In the study using 3 ×Tg-AD mice, sul-foraphane treatment reduced tau and p-tau at the protein level, but not mRNA, suggestingpost-translational modiﬁcations in tau expression [ 34]. Sulforaphane treatment has beenobserved to increase the level of HSP70 and CHIP , which has a unique binding afﬁnityfor tau and is known to play a role in tau ubiquitination and proteasome targeting for taudegradation [ 34,56]. In murine cortical neurons treated with A βoligomers, sulforaphane
also decreased the A β-induced hyperphosphorylation of tau [32].Although further studies are required to understand how sulforaphane affects taubiology, A β, Nrf2 lack, oxidative stress, and inﬂammation are known factors to promotetau phosphorylation [ 57–60], thus sulforaphane’s effect on inhibiting the production ofAβ[9,31,32,34,35,61], activating Nrf2 [ 9,10,31,38], and alleviating oxidative stress [9,32,37,40,43]and inﬂammation [ 9,32,37–39,42] may inhibit tau phosphorylation. The effects of sul-foraphane on tau were overviewed in Table 2.2.3. Sulforaphane and AD-Associated Inﬂammatory BiomarkersSulforaphane also affects inﬂammatory biomarkers associated with AD, as belowin AD-like cell and animal models (Table 3). For example, sulforaphane treatment ofPS1 V97L mice resulted in decreased levels of interleukin (IL)-1 βin brain tissue and tumornecrosis factor alpha (TNF- α) in the plasma [ 32]. Sulforaphane treatment of AD-like rat
induced by A βreduced neuroinﬂammation measured through the reduction of TNF- αand IL-1 β[37]. In mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells expressing APPswe, sulforaphane
induced by A βreduced neuroinﬂammation measured through the reduction of TNF- αand IL-1 β[37]. In mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells expressing APPswe, sulforaphanedecreased the levels of IL-1 β, IL-6, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide syn-thase (iNOS), and nuclear factor (NF)- κB p-p65 [ 9]. In human microglia-like THP-1 cellstreated with A β, sulforaphane suppressed the activation of NLRP3 (NLRP3: NOD-like
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 2929 7 of 16receptor, leucine-rich repeat (LRR), and pyrin domain-containing 3) inﬂammasome [ 38].Aβactivation of the NLRP3 inﬂammasome in microglia has been reported to contributeto IL-1 βmaturation and subsequent inﬂammatory responses [ 62]. Mice that are deﬁcientin NLRP3 are mostly protected from amyloid pathology, suppression of synaptic plastic-ity, and abnormal cognitive functions [ 62,63]. Thus, sulforaphane might play a role inreducing A β-induced neuroinﬂammation, amyloid pathology, and synaptic and cognitivedysfunction via inhibition of NLRP3. In human microglia-like THP-1 cells treated withAβ, sulforaphane also suppressed subsequent IL-1 βsecretion via the dephosphorylationof signal transducers and activators of transcription-1 (STAT-1), and the activation of theNrf2-regulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway [ 38]. microRNA (miRNA)-146a is apotential AD biomarker that appears to be selectively upregulated in the temporal cortex
and hippocampus in AD [ 64,65] and sulforaphane treatment in THP-1 cells decreased theAβ-induced expression of miRNA-146a [38].Table 3.

According to recent research results, sulforaphane treatment wasable to signiﬁcantly induce the expression of formyl peptide receptor (Fpr2), which isknown to regulate microglial phagocytosis and recovers the phagocytic activity of murineEOC-20 microglial cells decreased by A βoligomers [ 42]. In THP-1 cells, sulforaphanetreatment attenuated the effects of A βinduction, by reducing excessive intracellular Ca2+levels and blocking NF- κB to rescue the decrease in Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) activity
that is necessary for amyloid-stimulated phagocytosis [ 39]. Thus, sulforaphane inhib-ited NF- κB-mediated IL-1 βand TNF- αsecretion in THP-1 cells treated with A β[39]. Asactivation of Nrf2, an important sulforaphane target protein, suppresses the hyperacti-vation of microglia and protects against inﬂammatory disorders [ 68,69], sulforaphane-mediated activation of Nrf2 might also contribute to reducing the levels of AD-associatedinﬂammatory biomarkers.2.4.

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 2929 8 of 16causes the symptoms of memory loss seen in AD [ 24]. Sulforaphane inhibits the levels ofAD-associated oxidative stress biomarkers in AD-like models (Table 4). Sulforaphane aug-mented the cell’s capacity for antioxidant defense by activating Nrf2 in N2a cells expressingAPPswe [ 9] and in SH-SY5Y cells treated with A β[40,43]. In N2a cells expressing APPswe,this occurs by promotion of Nrf2 nuclear translocation by decreasing DNA methylationlevels of the Nrf2 promoter [ 9]. In these cells, sulforaphane also caused decreased levelsof reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased superoxidedismutase (SOD) activity [ 9]. Even in PS1 V97L mice and AD-like rat induced by A β, sul-foraphane increased GSH levels and decreased MDA levels [ 32,37]. Crude juices of broccolisprouts containing sulforaphane in SH-SY5Y cells treated with A βreduced oxidative stress
by intracellular increase of glutathione (GSH), HO-1, thioredoxin (Trx), and thioredoxinreductase (TrxR) as well as NQO-1 activity, likely through the Nrf2 signaling pathway [ 43].Together, these studies indicate that sulforaphane treatment attenuates biomarkers ofoxidative stress that are associated with AD.Table 4.

Sulforaphane and AD-Associated Biomarkers of Synaptic Damage and NeurodegenerationSulforaphane inhibits the levels of AD-associated biomarkers of synaptic damage andneurodegeneration in AD-like models, as well as inhibiting A β-induced neuronal cell death(Table 5). For example, the brain of 3 ×Tg-AD has low levels of brain-derived neurotrophicfactor (BDNF), a neurotrophin that supports the survival of existing neurons and encour-ages the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses, but sulforaphane has
been found to restore normal levels of BDNF of 3 ×Tg-AD mice [ 33]. In the frontal cortexof 3×Tg-AD mice, sulforaphane increased levels of neuronal and synaptic biomarkers,including: microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), a dendritic marker and structuralprotein present in neurons; synaptophysin, a pre-synaptic protein; and postsynaptic den-sity protein-95 (PSD-95), a membrane-associated protein located in neural postsynapticdensities [ 33]. It was reported that sulforaphane inhibits HDAC activity and increaseshistone-tail acetylation in 3 ×Tg-AD mice, thereby increasing BDNF levels and enhancingactivation of the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathways, which might further facilitate neuronal

Thus, sulforaphane might improve neuronal and cognitivefunctions, at least in part, by increasing BDNF levels epigenetically in BDNF-deﬁcientneuronal disorders such as AD [33].Table 5.

neuron-like cells (Table 5) [ 32,35,40,41,43]. Treatment with broccoli sprouts juices containingsulforaphane overexpressed HSP70 and exerted a protective action against the cytotoxicityand cell death A βinduced [ 43]. Sulforaphane rescued the dendritic length of the corticalneurons, which was reduced following A βincubation [ 32]. These studies indicate thatsulforaphane treatment might attenuate AD pathology, as evidenced by its effect on pre-clinical biomarkers associated with synaptic damage and neurodegeneration.2.6. Sulforaphane and Cognitive Impairment in AD-Like Animal ModelsSulforaphane ameliorated cognitive impairment in several transgenic AD-like animalmodels, including 5 ×FAD mice [ 31], 3×Tg-AD mice [ 31,34], APP/PS1 mice [ 35], andPS1 V97L mice [ 32]. Additionally, sulforaphane treatment improved cognitive function inAD-like mouse and rat model induced by the administration of A β[36,37]. Although it
is difﬁcult to explain the exact mechanism, it is highly likely that the pharmacologicaleffects of sulforaphane on the previously described pre-clinical AD biomarkers, A β, tau,inﬂammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration have led to improvements in cogni-tive impairment. The types of AD-like models, the dose of sulforaphane, and cognitiverecovery ﬁndings for sulforaphane are summarized in Table 6. These observations suggestthat sulforaphane might be able to ameliorate cognitive impairment in AD patients.

Conclusions and Future PerspectivesThe anti-AD-like activity of sulforaphan has been identiﬁed in six different animalmodels and eight different cell models (Tables 1–6). In animal models, four animal modelsproduced by modifying AD-related genes in an animal model to create the pathology ofhuman AD, and a mouse and a rat model made by direct intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)injections of A βinto the brain, which is known to induce AD-like pathology in the brain,were used to study the anti-AD-like activity of sulforaphan. In animal models, sulforaphanewas administered daily or every other day, for oral administration (per os, p.o.) for 2 to5 months, and for intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) for 7 days to 4 months. In the case of oral
administration, a dose of 10–50 mg/kg, in the case of i.p. injection, 5–10 mg/kg was triedto show the anti-AD-like activity of sulforaphane. In cell models, sulforaphane showedanti-AD-like effectiveness under the conditions of 0.01 µM–10 µM, 0.5–48 h treatment.It has been reported that AD already has pre-symptomatic pathologies in the brain10–15 years before cognitive decline [ 26]. In order to apply food-derived physiologicallyactive compounds such as sulforaphane to control AD, interventions that prevent or delaythe initial onset of symptoms are necessary. For this, research to ﬁnd and develop earlydiagnostic biomarkers capable of actively diagnosing patients with AD is essential. In 2018,the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and Alzheimer’s Association (AA) proposed a newframework to deﬁne AD diagnosis criteria based on pre-symptomatic biomarkers [ 70]. Theresearch framework focuses on the diagnosis of AD with biomarkers grouped into those
of Aβdeposition, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration [ 70]. In this review, pre-clinicalbiomarkers (1) A β, (2) tau, (3) inﬂammation, (4) oxidative stress, and (5) neurodegenerationwere selected based on the pre-symptomatic biomarkers currently being studied and sug-gested for clinical practices [ 27–30], and the effects and the mechanisms of sulforaphane onthem were overviewed (Figure 1 and Tables 2–6). Most importantly, sulforaphane can pre-vent the production of A βand tau [ 9,31,32,34,35,48], which are the main causative factorsfor AD. Sulforaphane can inhibit AD-associated inﬂammation [ 9,32,37–39,42], oxidativestress [ 9,32,37,40,43], and neurodegeneration [ 32,33,35,40,41,43]. Thus far, multi-target ef-fects of sulforaphane in many different cells and animal models suggest that sulforaphaneconsumption may reduce AD risk, raising the possibility of effective preventive strategies.

Sulforaphane ameliorates cognitiveimpairment and decreases the level of AD biomarkers for amyloid- β, tau, inﬂammation, oxidativestress and neurodegeneration in AD-like animal and cell models. These anti-AD-like evidences ofsulforaphane indicate the need to pursue sulforaphane research in pre-symptomatic AD patients.In one recent clinical trial, in which schizophrenic patients were administered
sulforaphane-rich broccoli sprout extract (Kagome Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan), three tabletsof sulforaphane per day (consisting of 30 mg of sulforaphane-glucosinolate per tablet) for8 weeks resulted in improved cognitive function in schizophrenic patients [ 17]. In anotherclinical trial, administration of sulforaphane derived from broccoli sprouts (Johns HopkinsUniversity, MD, USA) consisting of 50–150 µmol or 8.86–26.59 mg per day for 18 weeksimproved behavior in young men with ASD [ 18]. Many sulforaphane supplements on themarket are prepared in various ways from cruciferous plants, and the dosage, safety, andefﬁcacy have not been veriﬁed. Among them, Avmavol®(a sulforaphane-producing dietary
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021 ,22, 2929 12 of 16supplement) was studied to investigate (1) the dose-response evaluation of sulforaphane,(2) the bioavailability and mucosal bioactivity in healthy subjects, (3) the treatment effectsfor youth with ASDs, (4) the effects on autistic people living in New Jersey, USA, and (5)the effects on schizophrenia [71].In-depth human studies are needed on the medical beneﬁts of a sulforaphane-richbroccoli sprout diet. The association between the Keap1 and Nrf2 genes and cognitivefunction in patients with schizophrenial was studied, with an epistatic interaction betweenNrf2 and Keap1 gene variants on cognitive impairment (e.g., working memory and pro-cessing speed) [ 72]. Since sulforaphane modiﬁes Keap1 structure and activates Nrf2 [ 68],these ﬁndings suggest that the Keap1-Nrf2 system, which regulates oxidative stress andinﬂammation, may play a role in the cognitive impairment observed in schizophrenia. In
order to study the medical beneﬁts of a sulforaphane-rich broccoli sprout diet on cognitiveimpairment in AD, further studies on the intake of sulforaphane-rich broccoli sprout dietor sulforaphane in subjects at high risk of AD are needed. Besides cognitive impairment,a sulforaphane-rich broccoli sprout diet reduced colonization and attenuates gastritis inpeople infected with Helicobacter pylori [73] and sulforaphane-rich broccoli sprout bever-ages modulated the detoxiﬁcation metabolism of airborne-pollutants in the body, therebyreducing their associated health risks [ 74]. It has also been reported that daily intakeof a sulforaphane-rich broccoli sprout for 4 weeks improved defecation bowel habits inhuman subjects [75].In 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Agency for Researchon Cancer (IARC) published a chapter on cruciferous vegetables as recommendationsfor cancer prevention. Whether in the form of a sulforaphane supplement or in large
amounts of cruciferous vegetables, WHO recommended not to consume large amounts.It is generally not advisable for individuals to consume a diet that focuses on only onefood type and should be encouraged to consistently consume a variety of cruciferousvegetables as part of their diet. On the other hand, several clinical trials showed little to noside effects when reasonable amounts of cruciferous vegetables containing sulforaphanewere consumed [1].Evidences from several animal- and cell-based studies indicate the need to pursuesulforaphane research in pre-symptomatic AD patients, which is challenging. The dis-covery and development of practical and inexpensive biomarkers that can diagnose pre-symptomatic AD patients is essential. Genetic polymorphism, intestinal microbiome, andbody mass index (BMI) may affect the bioavailability of sulforaphane from cruciferousvegetable consumption [ 76–83], and through detailed follow-up studies, predictable re-
sponse groups of sulforaphane might be selected for randomized controlled trial. Theincrease in pre-clinical evidence consistently suggests that sulforaphane has a multi-facetedneuroprotective effect on AD pathophysiology and prevents the progression of the disease.Funding: This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the NationalResearch Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2020R1I1A1A01054684).Institutional Review Board Statement: Not applicableInformed Consent Statement: Not applicableData Availability Statement: Not applicableAcknowledgments: I would like to thank Seungeun Kook for drawing the cruciferous plants in theGraphical Abstract.Conﬂicts of Interest: The author has no conﬂict of interest to report.References1.
