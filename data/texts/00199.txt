Many lifestyle changes contribute to the worsening of puffy eyes in all age groups, while agin g, chronic medical conditions are al so a factor. The purpose of this study is to
identify the various remedies women use to treat periorbital ed ema with a focus on studying homemade remedies, their mechanism  of action and their effectivity. Study around this topic is import ant as there is a distinct lack of literature on a topic that is a cosmetic concern for women. Method: An online survey of 14 questions was conduct ed asking questions regarding periorbital edema and the quick e ffective homemade remedy used by them.  R esults: 50.8% (n=61) participan ts deal with puffy eyes while 49.2% (n=59) did not. From the 61  participants who dealt with eye puffiness, only 37.7% (n=23) to ok active measures to counteract it. From 23 respondents, it wa s found that most found using cold comp ression (n=17), getting enough s leep (n=11), and cucumbers (n=11) the most effective in dealing  with eye puffiness, while vitamin E, K, caffeine treatments and witch ha zel were less popular. Majority found these methods effective ‘ sometimes’,
and only one person didn’t find them effective. Conclusion: Wom en find cold compression, cucumber, and getting enough sleep mo st effective. Although more than half the participants of the surv ey dealt with eye puffiness, majority chose not to treat them.

INTRODUCTION  Periorbital edema is a common clinical finding observed as swel ling around eye tissue, in layman terms also referred to as eye  puffiness and sometimes also as periorbital puffiness.  The primary cause of the occurrence of swelling around the orbi ts is due to inflammation resulting in fluid buildup and fluid collection around the eye. This condition, usually of not any s erious clinical significance, can be attributed to various life style causes such as lack of sleep, allergy, increased alcohol intake, incre ased consumption of salt, spending long hours using electronic devices,
and various conditions like menstruation and pregnancy causing hormonal changes; and hence fluid retention in the tissue and t he appearance of swelling. Other causes include infections, relate d to use of some medications and or postsurgical trauma [1 ] whi le some serious medical conditions c ausing periorbital edema inclu de renal diseases, hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism, anemia, hypertension, tumors etc.  Treatment for periorbital edema is wide ranging depending on th e cause which includes medications such as anti-inflammatory medicines, corticosteroids, anti-histamines, antibiotics etc, w hile the home remedies include applying cucumber slices around the orbit region, using green tea (masks/eyemasks) [2], tea bags, f acial massage, using eye rollers, witch hazel [3], rose water [ 4], hot and cold compression, aloe vera  (gel/masks), all these natural ingredients containing anti-infl ammatory and anti-oxidant prope rties which helps in easing the swelling around the eyes.

There is a distinct lack of study and literature surrounding th e topic of periorbital edema and the various modes of treatment  and hence with this study we aim to contribute to the literature su rrounding the same. II. METHOD  120 females were a part of this study and the data collection was done using a questionnaire consisting of 14 questions, creat ed
on Google Forms, which was circulated on various social media p latforms to reach the target audience. The questionnaire was designed to collect dat a on periorbita l edema and the natural r emedies women used to treat the same.  The questionnaire was anonymous and no personal data or partici pant emails were collected. In the questionnaire the participan ts were faced with multiple choice questions and open-ended descri ptive questions. There was also no time limit given.  The first question in the questionnaire required the consent of  the participant. Upon giving their consent to move forward wit h the survey, the following questions were asked: 1. Please specify your age: 2. Do you deal with puffy eyes? If the participants answered “Yes”, the next questions were ask ed: 3. On a scale of 1 to 5 (with 1 being the least and 5 being the  highest), rate how prone you are to eye puffiness. 4. Do you use any products for y our eyes (eg. undereye cream et c)?
5. Is the product you're using effective for your puffy eyes? 6. How many hours of sleep do you get every night? 7. Do you usually wake up with puffy eyes? 8. Do you suffer from any of these chronic medical conditions: 9. Would you say your puffy eyes  are because of genetic reasons ? 10. Do you take active measures to reduce eye puffiness? If the participant answered “Yes” , the following questions were  asked: 11. What do you use to limit the prominence of puffy eyes? 12. Do you think these methods are efficient? 13. Which new method are you willing to try to reduce eye puffi ness? The options included in question 8 were: Renal Diseases, Anemia, Hypertension, and none. The options included in question 11 & 13 were: Witch Hazel, Cuc umber, Green Tea, Rose Water, Aloe Vera, Hot compression, Cold Compression, Caffeine Treat ment, Eye drops, Reducing Salt and Potassium rich food, Getting plenty of sleep, Reducing
alcohol consumption, Doctor’s advice, Facial massage technique (eg. Jade rollers). Participants  were free to choose any number  of options according to their personal usage.  Upon completing the questionnaire the participants clicked subm it and the data was collected III.  RESULTS  The online survey received a total of 120 r esponses which garne red 100% participation. Those who took the survey were specifically female. This was co ntrolled by sending it to Whatsapp group chats, Subreddits and
Effective Home Remedies that Provide Quick Relief for Puffy Eye s     Vol. 28 No. 2 September 2021               ISSN: 2509-0119 45 Facebook groups with only female members. This was the limit to  which the authors could control the survey as to having only female participation. The survey was popular with those between the ages of 17-20 wit h 38.3% (46 people) participation followed by 21 – 25 years category with 31.7% of the resp onses and those above 30 years o f age with 23.3%. In comparison, involvement of those below the  ages of 17 and those between 26- 3 0 years of age remained fairl y low with 5 and 3 responses respectively. Participants were then asked if they dealt with puffy eyes and 61 ‘Yes’ responses were receiv ed which amounts to about 50.8% participation as a total from here on till the end of the surve y. Those 49 participants who cou ntered with a ‘No’ were then di rected to the end of the survey. This can be seen in Fig 1.       Fig 1.
Fig 1.  Next, the remaining survey taker s were asked on a scale of 1 t o 5 (with 1 being the least and 5 being the highest), to rate h ow prone they were to eye puffiness. There was great feedback in t he midpoint at ‘3’ with 27 responses. In contrast, the ‘5’ extr eme got only 3 responses.  Members were asked if they used eye creams and the majority  (47 participants) claimed that they didn’t leaving the remaining 14 people split equally between their effectiveness.  Participants were also more likely to sleep for 6-8 hrs (29 res ponses) with a mode of 7 hours and there seems to be varied eff ects of sleep on puffy eyes with 41 pa rticipants answering ‘Sometime s’, 15 with ‘Yes’ and 5 with ‘No’.  Chronic medical condition doesn’t seem to be a predisposition for 67.2% for the members. Only 20 people seemed to suffer, with 11 having low hemoglobin, 5 with hypertension and 4 with h ypothyroidism. Moreover, only 14 partakers believed that their
eye puffiness to be b ecause of genetics. In the next section, participants were asked whether they took active measures to reduce eye puff iness and the majority at 62. 3% (38 people) selected ‘No ’. This is seen in Fig 2. These partici pants were directed to the end of the survey.

Within the remaining 23 people, it appears that cold compression (17 response s), getting enough sleep (11 responses) and cucumbers (11 responses) seemed to be the most helpful as a qui ck remedy to the prominence of p eriorbital edema as shown in Fi g 3. Participants also were given the option of adding their own techniques and it appears that 3  new remedies were received wit h those being ‘vitamin E and vitamin K treatments’, ‘eye serums a nd collagen masks’ and ‘drinking a lot of water’.               Fig 3. Members also considered the methods to be effective with 9 part icipants agreeing to ‘Yes’ and 13 to ‘Sometimes’. This was challenged by only 1 participant who chose ‘No’ as can be seen in Fig 4.

The final question revealed that most participants were willing  to try different methods to help with the appearance of puffy eyes. 40.9% (9 participants) wanted to try getting more sleep w hile the other most popular option were getting doctors’ advice  and trying out facial massage techniques, both with 36.4% (8 partic ipants). Recognition to other methods by the survey takers was also observed. For example, reducing salt and potassium intake is de liberated as compared to the data in Fig 3 which shows that onl y 3 people were trying this technique while 7 participants seemed t o consider this as an option. This is a similar case with caffe ine treatments and witch hazel with only 1 person each with active use of it. 6 participants were willing to try out caffeine trea tments
and 3 participants were interest ed to add witch hazel into thei r routine. IV.  DISCUSSION  Periorbital edema is also more commonly known as puffy eyes, un der eye bags, swollen eyelids et c. The area around the eyelids is very delicate with high vasculature and thin dermal layers. Hence, this is a region in the face that is prone to inflammati on and there are a multitude of reasons for their causation. Age, life  style choices for example diets rich in salts or potassium, sl eeping habits, alcohol consumption, daily screen time, skin care routi ne as well as genetics and chronic illnesses contribute to the development of per iorbital edema.  Research in this criterion is important because while there is an abundance of articles published on general skin care, there seems to be a certain lack of it concer ning periorbital edema. Hence,  our research aims to help find what home remedies are most eff icient in reducing the appearing of puffy eyes.
in reducing the appearing of puffy eyes.  Our online survey was targeted to a sample size of 120 out of w hich 61 participants claimed that they do deal with this predicament. From these respondents, we found out that the amount of sl eep hours do have some sort of effect on eye bags, but that they might not be the primary r eason as to why people wake up with them. This is also the same case that is seen in those part icipants who use eye creams and were split between their effectiveness. This suggests that while sleep a nd eye creams are effective in some cases, there might be some other u nderlying reason as to why th ey are only helpful to some of our participants and only some t imes. Unfortunately, there is not much  research done on this topic. I t is something to consider moving forward. We also found that only 23 participants (37.7%) from 61 respons es took active measures to counteract the appearance of
periorbital edema. This shows that many women tend to disregard their eye bags rather than treat them highlighting the need fo r more awareness of periorbital edema. When asked what our respondents use to reduce the appearance of  swollen eyes, 23 participants gave us various results, but col d compression, cucumbers and getting ample amount of sleep was mo st effective in reducing their eye bags.
Effective Home Remedies that Provide Quick Relief for Puffy Eye s     Vol. 28 No. 2 September 2021               ISSN: 2509-0119 48 Witch Hazel: 4.3% ( 1 participant)  One study tested three herbs incl uding witch hazel  for their an tioxidant properties as they were reported to possess high polyphenolic content as well as anti-aging abilities via inhibi tion of collagenase and elastase. [5] These are enzymes that breakdown the structures of colla gen and elastin respectively, gives the looks of sagging skin which can be seen in eye bags caused due to age.  Witch hazel leaves and bark cont ain up to 10% tannins (polyphen olic biomolecules), which contribute to its astringent properties. This study also rev ealed that for the witch hazel d istillate, which was used for testing, the practical anti-inflammatory effects are still c onsiderable and validate the pu rpose for which they are advertised. [5] Cucumber: 47.8% (11 participants)
Cucumber: 47.8% (11 participants) According to one research paper, c ucumber slices can subdue puf finess under the eyes because of its anti-inflammatory properties. [6] This is a very common and effective method that  is also reflected in our st udy and echoed by another study which states that placing the two slice of cucumber on th e eyes for ten minutes can re duce the puffiness noticeably. This same article claims that the regular intake of cucumber fr uit is useful in skin problems , sunburn and also for curing swelling under the eye. In additi on, it’s juice is also used to  soften the skin. [7] Green Tea: 21.7% (5 participants) Green tea is made from un-oxidised leaves of Camellia sinensis.  The minimal processing of thi s tea is the reason why its extract is rich in the highest amount of antioxidants and benef icial polyphenols with minim um amount of caffeine.
Epigallocatechin-3-gallate, a bio active polyphenol is found in  green tea and is recognized fo r its anti inflammatory and anti carcinogenic effects. It appears that even the used tea wa stes are useful to cut back re dness and inflammation on skin but these are also found to be helpful to reduce dark circles a nd puffy eyes. [8]  Rose Water: 26.1% (6 participants) In 2019, a study aimed to evalua te the antioxidant and inflamma tory activity of aqueous petals extract of Rosa damascene cream for its radical scavenging and protein denatura tion activity. The result of the  research concluded that the rose water cream  formulation F1 and F2 possess the high pot ential of antioxidant and an ti-inflammatory properties. The observed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects can be attributed majorly to the presence of polyphenolic compounds such as flavonoids, tannins, triterpenoids, saponins in the rose water. [9] Cold Compression: 73.9% (17 participants)
Cold Compression: 73.9% (17 participants) The American Academy of Ophthalmol ogy affirms that fluid can al so pool in the periorbital area and lead to edema (swelling) which as gives the a ppearance of puffy eyes. It was advised to wet a clean washc loth with cool water and to place it around the swo llen area for a while applying very gent le pressure. [10] Cool temperatures are known to cause vasoconstriction of the ti ny vasculature around th e periorbital area. This successively results in  reversal effects in fluid retention.  Caffeine Treatment: 4.3% (1 participant) Another article conducted a study that was aimed to distinguish  physicochemical propertie s and to see the in-vivo effectiveness in decreasing unde r eye swelling of the prepared caffeine gels. As stated previ ously, the eyelids are the thinnest skin in the body, and this easily leads the blood vess els to show through the skin  caused a swollen and dark
appearance called puffy eyes. Pl acing cool, damp tea bags on th e eyelids has been thought to reduce swollen eyes due to the vasoconstriction action of ca ffeine which is known for its mild stimulant properties to t he central nervous system.
the vasoconstriction action of ca ffeine which is known for its mild stimulant properties to t he central nervous system.  However, in this study, the resu lts declared that the cooling e ffect of the hydrophilic gels pr ovided a greater response to the reduction of swollen eyelids than the vasoconstriction effe cts of caffeine. Only 23.5% of the volunteers responded to caffeine activity. Consequently, it shows that while the effect  of caffeine is small compared  to other methods, it is still very much an option for some people as everybody’s skin is uniq ue. [11]
Effective Home Remedies that Provide Quick Relief for Puffy Eye s     Vol. 28 No. 2 September 2021               ISSN: 2509-0119 49 Reducing Salt and Potassium ric h food: 13% (3  participants) Eyelid edema as a manifestation of fluid accumulation is often worse after a salty meal or in the morning. Due to the presence of the orbicularis ocu li muscle in the lower eyelid, t he fluids accumulated tends to  take a purple hue.[12] Salt and potassium causes in creased periocular bl ood flow and vascul ar permeability, both of which leads to signs of inflammation.  Getting plenty of sleep: 47.8% (11 participants) The difference in facial indica tions of sleep deprivation in co mparison to good rest was carried out in an experimental laboratory study in 2013. A lack of sleep in both genders was r elated to looking drastically more exhausted, having more hanging eyelids, redder eyes, mo re swollen eyes, darker circles  under the eyes and more wri nkles/lines around the eyes.
[13] Reducing alcohol consumption: 8.7% (2 participants) The aim of one large study was to determine the skin and volume  related clinical manifesta tion associated with alcohol and tobacco use in women. Their r esults presented that heavy al cohol use (≥8 drinks/week) was associated with increased under-eye puffiness. [14] Alcohol abuse is known to affect the body in many adverse ways for example with damage to the tissues, impaired inflammatory responses, reduced ability of fibroblast in the sk in to produce type l collagen and some vitamin deficiencies. [15] – [18] Facial massage techniques (eg. Jade rollers): 21.7% (5 particip ants) A clinical study and histology s howed that gentle facial massag e has an anti-inflammatory  effect on the musculature (with an effect on nucleoporin 88). [19] Eye serum and collagen masks: 4.3% (1 participant)
A study investigated the effects of a topical eye cream contain ing LMW‐HS and a blend of naturally derived extracts to address global periorbital rejuvenation. Subjects reported a de crease in puffiness (73%) and dark circles (93%). The outcome established that an eye c ream with LMW‐HS and a blend o f naturally extracted compunds achieved global skin rejuvenation by improving the m anifestation of periorbital hype rpigmentation, puffiness, and fine and coarse wrinkles. [20] Regrettably, there was not much literature based on ‘drinking a  lot of water’ [4.3 (1 participant)], ‘eye drops’ [21.7% (5 participants)], hot compression [13% (3 participants)] and aloe  vera [30.4% (7 participants)] a nd their mechanisms to prevent eye puffiness despite of being well known quick remedies. Our limitations are adhered to the fact that the sample size of  our study is of only 120 women and, to reiterate, the restrict ed
amount of research based on periorbital edema. This is why it w ould be beneficial to have more evidence based off of on large scaled studies regarding the qui ck remedies to eye puffiness. V. CONCLUSION  This research aimed at identifying the quick and effective home  remedies that women incorporate in daily lives to counteract eye puffiness, and reviewing their properties. Based on the ana lysis of the data collected fro m the online questionnaire, we c onclude that women find cold compression, applying cucumber, and gettin g enough sleep most effective in  dealing with eye puffiness, wh ile vitamin E, K, caffeine treatments and witch hazel were less pop ular. With this research, we cont ributed to learning more about  the natural and easy-to-use ingredients in treating periorbital ede ma. Although more than half the participants of the survey deal t with
