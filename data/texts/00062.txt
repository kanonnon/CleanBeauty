IntroductionCyclosporine A (CsA) is a cyclic undecapeptide of 1202.6 Da thatwas discovered in the 1970s by Sandoz [1]. Given its strongimmunosuppressive potency, it was ﬁrst developed to counter graftrejection following organ transplantation [2]. Its large molecularweight and hydrophobic nature (LogP = 1.4–3.0; solvent depen-dent) are responsible for its low aqueous solubility (6.6–106 lg/mL; temperature dependent) [3,4] , necessitating the developmentof drug delivery strategies to maximize its bioavailability. CsA wasinitially marketed as an injectable ethanolic solution in the mid-
1980s and then as an oily solution from the early 1990s, under thetrade name Sandimmune/C210[5]. In the mid-1990s, the formulationwas modiﬁed to improve its systemic bioavailability. Since then,CsA has been developed as a self-microemulsifying drug deliverysystem marketed under the trade name Neoral/C210as an oral solutionand as soft gel capsules. In liver-transplanted patients, CsA areaunder the curve (AUC) and maximum serum concentration (C max)were 50% and 90% higher, respectively, following Neoral/C210treatmentcompared with Sandimmune/C210treatment [6].In ophthalmology, CsA use was investigated as early as 1981,initially for administration after corneal graft transplantation [7].CsA also showed interesting activity in uveitis, corneal healing,vernal keratoconjunctivitis and other inﬂammatory diseases ofthe eye [4,8] . Initially, CsA was administered orally for the treat-ment of ophthalmic diseases. Although CsA was able to reach ther-
apeutic levels in different ocular tissues [9], the non-ocularadministration led to occurrence of systemic adverse events suchas nephrotoxicity, hypertension, anemia, paresthesia and hyperes-thesia [10]. Therefore, local (ocular) administration of CsA-loaded
administration led to occurrence of systemic adverse events suchas nephrotoxicity, hypertension, anemia, paresthesia and hyperes-thesia [10]. Therefore, local (ocular) administration of CsA-loadedproducts became the preferred method of delivery for treatmentof ophthalmic pathologies.Given that the eye is essentially an extension of the central ner-vous system, ocular drug delivery is particularly challenging, espe-cially for the local delivery of poorly water-soluble and/or largemolecules. The eye possesses a multitude of protective mecha-nisms against external threats such as dust, xenobiotics and patho-gens. These defense mechanisms (e.g. blinking, tearing and tearﬁlm turnover) are extremely efﬁcient in clearing foreign elementsfrom the ocular surface [11]. However, they also lead to very poordrug penetration for topically applied ocular drugs, typically below5%[12]. Over the past two decades, several drug delivery strategies
have been investigated that enhance the ocular bioavailability ofCsA following topical instillation to achieve and improve diseasemanagement without the CsA-induced systemic adverse effectsassociated with oral administration ( Fig. 1 ). These efforts ﬁnallyled to the commercialization of several eye drops based on variousdrug delivery systems. The ﬁrst ophthalmic product on the UnitedStates (US) market was Restasis/C210, approved in 2002 [13] andlaunched in 2003 by Allergan, whereas Santen (Novagali) becamethe ﬁrst company to reach the European Union (EU) market withCsA eye drops (Ikervis/C210) in 2015 [14]. Both products utilizenanoemulsion drug delivery systems and are intended for thetreatment of dry eye disease (DED).In 2003, Lallemand et al. [4]published a comprehensive reviewon CsA ocular delivery. At that time, Restasis/C210was the only

commercially available CsA ophthalmology product approved foruse, and it was licensed only in the US, not in the EU. Presently,the topical ocular CsA landscape has evolved substantially, withnewly available marketed products and new companies develop-ing innovative CsA-based products for ophthalmic diseases. Thisreview gives a compendium of the ophthalmic CsA products thatare currently available as well as emerging drug delivery systemsthat are being developed to treat dry eye disease in academic aswell as industry settings.2. Available productsThe use of CsA in DED has been described for several decades[15], yet only a few products have been successful in reachingthe pharmaceutical market place ( Table 1 ). The main ocular indica-tions that these marketed CsA products are used for include DEDand severe allergy (e.g. vernal keratoconjunctivitis, VKC). Alter-nately, hospital-compounded formulations have been widely in
use for a range of diseases of the ocular surface and anterior seg-ment [16–18] .Because of the very poor aqueous solubility of CsA, formulationstrategies have focused on developing novel mechanisms to delivera solubilized state of the drug to the corneal surface. Additionalchallenges in ophthalmic formulations include safety and tolerabil-ity of the product for direct ocular application. These eye dropproducts should be devoid of any inactive excipients that haveunwanted ocular surface altering properties (e.g. penetrationenhancers like laurocapram, which is cytotoxic to the cornealepithelium, and Cremophor/C210, which is associated with structuralchanges to the corneal surface) [4,19] . Ideally, these formulationsought to be preservative free and should replenish and/or stabilizethe tear ﬁlm layers without disturbing the ocular surface systemhomeostasis and functions.As a consequence of these limitations and challenges, oil-in-
water emulsions (e.g. Restasis/C210, Lacrinmune/C210and Ikervis/C210) andTable 1List of ocular formulations of cyclosporine A marketed in different countries.Product name Company Dosage form DosingregimenIndication RegionaMarketedsinceRestasis/C210(0.5 mg/mL) Allergan Anionicemulsion (UD)bid DED (KCS with presumed suppression oftear production)US, Canada and 33 othercountries2003Ikervis/C210(1.0 mg/mL) Santen PharmaceuticalCo.

micelle-based solutions (e.g. Papilock Mini/C210, Modusik-A Ofteno/C210and Taejoon [TJ] Cyporin/C210) have been successfully developed andregistered to treat DED ( Table 2 )[20–23] . In addition, Schering-Plough produces and markets a CsA ophthalmic ointment for thetreatment of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) in dogs [24]. All ofthese ophthalmic products signiﬁcantly lubricate the eye becausethey are mostly (>90%) composed of water [12]. The oily excipientsadditionally beneﬁt the ocular surface by restoring the lipid layerof the tear ﬁlm and protecting the aqueous layer from drying out[25,26] . Interestingly, none of these products contain the most fre-quently used ophthalmic preservative agent in glaucoma drugs,benzalkonium chloride (BAK), which is reported to be deleteriousto the corneal tissues [27]. Unique among the marketed products,the Ikervis/C210formulation contains quaternary ammonium cetalko-
nium chloride (CKC), which acts as an emulsiﬁer as well as a catio-nic surfactant to stabilize the colloidal system. It wasdemonstrated that CKC in Ikervis/C210neither has a preservative rolenor exhibits any corneal toxicity [8,26] . It additionally exhibitsan ocular safety proﬁle similar to that of Restasis/C210and hospital-compounded CsA formulations [8]. A study using human cornealcells showed that a CKC-based nanoemulsion had similar effectson cell survival to a phosphate-buffered saline solution [28].It is worth noting that none of the currently licensed productsare globally available. This may be because some of these productswere developed by local companies and launched only within theircountry or a speciﬁc region (i.e. Modusik-A Ofteno/C210by Sophia Lab-oratorios in Mexico and Latin America or TJ Cyporin/C210by TaejoonPharm in South Korea) [23]. Alternatively, a product may havebeen developed for potential global use but failed to receive mar-
keting authorization across all regions (e.g. Restasis/C210was approvedby the US Food and Drug Administration [13] but is not currentlyapproved for use in all EU countries [14]). This discrepancy reﬂectsdifferences in regulatory guidelines and the interpretation of clin-ical trial results from one country/region to another.2.1. SolutionsAqueous solutions are usually the simplest eye drop formula-tions, as their composition and manufacturing processes are rela-tively simple. Aside from their ease of preparation, a potentialadvantage of solutions is enhanced bioavailability of the drug sub-stance given that it is already dispersed at the molecular level.However, a signiﬁcant concern with ocular solutions is the dilutionand consequent washing away of the solvent with tear ﬂuid, leav-ing behind a solute precipitate that could limit bioavailability ofthe drug to the tissues located in the front of the eye. For CsA,
which is poorly soluble in water, surfactants and co-solvents (e.g.ethanol) are required to form a solution that remains stablethroughout its shelf life [25]. The addition of surfactants to thesolution helps in the formation of small micelles, which arise asthe surfactant molecules aggregate with their hydrophilic portionsorientated outwards towards the water and their hydrophobicparts clustering inwards, encapsulating the lipid-soluble CsA[29]. Surfactants form micelles when present in water at concen-trations above the critical micellar concentration (CMC). Bioavail-ability of the CsA is enhanced by the solubilizing effect of micelleformation and also by the high permeation through biologicalmembranes that the micelles provide [29], being typically 20–50 nm. Once instilled in the eye, the concentration gradient facili-tates absorption of the drug by adjacent tissues. In addition, thelarge speciﬁc surface area of micelles increases the bioavailability
of the drug [29]. Sometimes, tear ﬂuid dilution of the eye dropcould reduce the surfactant concentration below its CMC, thereby
large speciﬁc surface area of micelles increases the bioavailabilityof the drug [29]. Sometimes, tear ﬂuid dilution of the eye dropcould reduce the surfactant concentration below its CMC, therebyleading to the precipitation of CsA. However, this phenomenonoccurs relatively slowly due to the low dilution ratio of the tearﬁlm, thus providing ample time for drug absorption.High concentrations of surfactant are deleterious to biologicaltissues, and surfactants are not speciﬁc in terms of enhancing per-meation. A potential disadvantage of aqueous solutions is theirlong-term tolerability, since repeated instillations of surfactant-containing formulations could potentially affect the ocular surfacetissues [30]. To avoid the abrasive effects of ionic emulsifyingagents, the use of non-ionic surfactants is preferred for aqueoussolution formulations.Since 2003, several CsA solutions have been developed and suc-cessfully marketed. In these products, CsA is dissolved with the
help of ethanol and non-ionic surfactants, such as polysorbate 80and polyoxyl-40 stearate. Papilock Mini/C210(Santen), approved foruse in Japan since 2005, is a 0.1% CsA aqueous solution adminis-tered three times per day for the treatment of vernal keratocon-junctivitis (VKC) [31]. This formulation of Papilock Mini/C210VKCincludes hydroxypropyl methylcellulose as a viscosity-modulating agent, which enables the solution to remain on theocular surface by physical means of retention, consequentlyincreasing the residence time of the product [31–33] .In Mexico and several other Latin American countries, Modusik-A Ofteno/C210, commercialized by Sophia Laboratories, is indicated forthe treatment of DED [21]. The formulation is based on thepatented SophisenTMplatform (ethanol and a combination of sur-factants) and designed to improve the solubilization and cornealbioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs.TJ Cyporin N/C210(Taejoon Pharma) and Cyporin/C210(Aristopharma
Ltd.) are aqueous solutions containing 0.05% w/w CsA and areavailable in some countries in Asia, including South Korea, Bangla-desh and Myanmar [23].2.2. EmulsionsAs CsA is highly soluble in various oils, e.g. medium-chaintriglycerides (MCTs), castor oil and olive oil, lipid-based formula-tions are particularly well suited for CsA delivery [4]. The use oflipid-based emulsions is a strategy that has notably been used byNovartis (formerly Sandoz) for the development of Sandimmune/C210and Neoral/C210, which are classiﬁed as self-emulsifying drug deliverysystems [34]. These formulations are isotropic mixtures of oils, sur-factants, solvents and co-solvents/surfactants, and they are partic-ularly attractive for an oral product since the (micro) emulsion getsformed spontaneously in vivo upon dilution of the lipid-based for-mulation in gastrointestinal ﬂuids. However, this strategy is inap-propriate for corneal instillation because the large amounts of
surfactants could have deleterious effects on the cornea and couldresult in blurred vision. Hence, conventional oil-in-water emul-sions have been developed to deliver CsA to ocular tissues locatedin the front of the eye. These formulations have a number of advan-tages: they spread readily over the ocular surface, maximize thespeciﬁc surface given the nano-sized oil droplets and are well tol-erated (low surfactant quantity [12,26] ). In addition, because thedrug is already dispersed at the molecular level and encapsulatedwithin the oil droplet, the risk of precipitation on the ocular surfaceis avoided. Similar to these emulsions, the tear ﬁlm itself is com-prised of a lipid and an aqueous phase [35]. Therefore, it is possiblethat a fraction of the oil droplet encapsulating CsA may merge withthe tear ﬁlm lipid layer (TFLL), entrapping a portion of active drugwithin. Since the TFLL turnover is much longer than that of the
aqueous phase, TFLL may act as a drug reservoir and allow for sus-
the tear ﬁlm lipid layer (TFLL), entrapping a portion of active drugwithin. Since the TFLL turnover is much longer than that of theaqueous phase, TFLL may act as a drug reservoir and allow for sus-tained release of CsA [36]; however, there is no direct evidence toconﬁrm this hypothesis thus far.Although nanoemulsions are more complex formulations thanconventional aqueous eye drop solutions, they can be easily man-ufactured on a large scale using speciﬁc equipment, such as high-pressure homogenizers, and simply sterilized by ﬁltration or auto-clave. In 2003, Allergan was the ﬁrst company to bring a licensedF. Lallemand et al. / European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 117 (2017) 14–28 17
formulation of CsA eye drops to market. Restasis/C210, a preservative-free anionic oil-in-water nanoemulsion, contains CsA dissolved incastor oil with polysorbate 80 as the emulsifying agent. The result-ing emulsion is further stabilized by carbomer copolymer [22]. Themarketing authorization for Restasis/C210in the United States wasgranted by the FDA in 2002 [13]. However, Restasis/C210is presentlynot approved in the EU, and its use is only allowed for compassion-ate use [14].Bausch & Lomb launched Lacrinmune/C210in Argentina, which hasa composition similar to that of Restasis/C210, except for the addition ofsodium hyaluronate to the emulsion [37]. Hyaluronic acid deriva-tives are well known and are widely used in the management ofmild to moderate dry eye syndrome, for example Vismed/C210(TRBChemedica), Hyalein/C210(Santen) and Opticalmax/C210(Omega Pharma).
The addition of sodium hyaluronate increases the viscosity of theemulsion, resulting in a longer residence time on the ocular surfacethan that of aqueous eye drops.In 2015, Ikervis/C210(Santen) was granted marketing authorizationby the European Medicines Agency for use in Europe. Ikervis/C210is acationic nanoemulsion indicated for the treatment of severe kerati-tis in adult patients with DED that has not improved despite treat-ment with tear substitutes [38]. The cationic nanoemulsion is apatented technology based on the Novasorb/C210platform developedby Novagali Pharma, France (now Santen SAS). Due to the net pos-itive charge of the oil nanodroplets, the residence time and theocular bioavailability of CsA are higher with the cationic emulsionthan with other formulations. In a pharmacokinetic study on rabbiteyes, corneal exposure to CsA after a single dose was 1.84 timesgreater for a 0.05% CsA cationic emulsion (Novasorb/C210formulation)
than for a 0.05% CsA anionic emulsion (Restasis/C210); AUC 0–72 h26,703.0 ng h/g and 14,333.2 ng h/g, respectively [39]. Correspond-ingly, the corneal clearance of CsA was 57% less for the 0.05% CsAcationic emulsion than for the 0.05% CsA anionic emulsion (0.8 g/h and 1.4 g/h, respectively). It is assumed that the residence timeof CsA in Ikervis/C210(Novasorb/C210CsA cationic nanoemulsion) isgreater than that in Restasis/C210(CsA anionic nanoemulsion) becauseof electrostatic interactions between the positively charged dro-plets and negatively charged mucus protein of the corneal epithe-lium [12]. This mechanism of action would work in conjunctionwith the hypothesized reservoir effect of the TFLL. The combina-tion of these effects, as well as higher dosage strength, could verylikely explain the difference in dosing regimen between once-a-day Ikervis/C210versus twice-a-day Restasis/C210.Kuwano et al. [40] compared the ocular pharmacokinetics of
three CsA formulations in rabbit eyes: a castor oil solution (Oil-CsA), a micellar solution (Aq-CsA) having a composition similarto Papilock mini/C210and an oil-in-water emulsion (Em-CsA) with acomposition similar to Restasis/C210. This study reported that theAUC 0–12 of Em-CsA and Aq-CsA were, respectively, 9.2- and 28.5-fold higher than the AUC 0–12of Oil-CsA in corneal stroma endothe-lium. The same pattern was observed in the bulbar conjunctiva,wherein the AUC 0–12 of Em-CsA and Aq-CsA were 2.4-fold and5.1-fold higher than the AUC 0–12 of Oil-CsA, respectively [40].These results clearly showed that micellar solutions of CsAimprove the ocular bioavailability of CsA. Improving the bioavail-ability of CsA in ocular tissues is obviously required to maximizethe clinical efﬁcacy of CsA products. Nevertheless, DED is a verycomplex disease with diverse signs and symptoms, and an optimaltreatment may require additional interventions alongside pharma-
cological therapy to achieve optimal outcomes.2.3. OthersBesides ophthalmologic use in humans, CsA has been availablefor veterinary applications since the late 1980s [41,42] . Optim-
cological therapy to achieve optimal outcomes.2.3. OthersBesides ophthalmologic use in humans, CsA has been availablefor veterinary applications since the late 1980s [41,42] . Optim-mune/C210(Merck), a 0.2% CsA ophthalmic ointment of petrolatum,corn oil and lanolin alcohol, has been commercialized by Intervetfor treatment of KCS and superﬁcial keratitis in dogs [24]. Theoret-ically, residence time of ointment formulations on the ocular sur-face tissues is longer than that of eye drops [43]. In addition,administration of this semi-solid formulation may be easier thanliquid drops in dogs.3. Hospital-compounded preparationsAs the availability of marketed ophthalmic products containingCsA is limited, especially for higher strengths (0.5–2% w/w), com-pounded formulations are prepared in hospital pharmacies. A ret-rospective study examining of compounded CsA eye drops (oil
solution) prepared by the Hôtel-Dieu de Paris Hospital (Paris,France) noted that 2% (2 mg/mL) CsA solution is the most com-monly prepared formulation (44,243 preparations out of a totalof 62,635 in 2013), and this dosage strength was primarily usedfor the prevention of corneal graft rejection (61% of cases) [44].Lower dosage strengths (0.5% and 0.05%) were typically used totreat dry eye syndrome, Gougerot-Sjögren syndrome, ocular rosa-cea and severe allergies (atopic keratoconjunctivitis and VKC), aswell as to prevent high-risk corneal graft rejection. The com-pounded preparations of CsA for ophthalmic use vary widely incomposition and dosage strengths as inferred from a recent pan-European survey of ophthalmologists on the use of ophthalmichospital preparations of CsA [18]. While the survey indicated thatmost of the compounded formulations of CsA consisted of a mix-ture of Sandimmune/C210solution (either oral or injectable) or Optim-
mune/C210(0.2% veterinary ointment) and artiﬁcial tears or oils, it alsodemonstrated the differences in CsA formulations that are dis-pensed for treating speciﬁc ocular conditions across the hospitalssurveyed.Knagenhjelm et al. [45] demonstrated the absence of ocular tox-icity in formulations of CsA (Sandimmune/C210oral solution orSandimmune/C210infusion concentrate) mixed with peanut oilthrough a short-term study on rabbit eyes. A study by Benitezdel Castillo et al. [46] showed no signiﬁcant differences in theincrease in permeability of 2% CsA in olive oil (7.03 times) versusolive oil alone (6.68 times) into the corneal epithelium after a sin-gle instillation of the compounded preparation ( P= 0.651). Theauthors of this study concluded that olive oil, by itself, increasescorneal permeability through a toxic effect on the corneal epithe-lium and recommended reducing the use of olive oil solutions ofCsA to avoid the potential side-effects. Nevertheless, given the
heterogeneity in the composition and the operating processes forpreparing and packaging of drugs among compounding pharma-cies, signiﬁcant differences in the efﬁcacy and tolerance betweenthese CsA formulations are inevitable.Other compounded CsA formulations have also been reported inliterature. Bontemps et al. [47] describe formulation of 0.1%, 1%and 2% CsA eye drops by evaporating the ethanol contained inSandimmune/C210injection solution and replacing this volume withartiﬁcial tears (Dulcilarmes/C210). Although the CsA content of theresultant solution was stable when stored for 90 days in the refrig-erator, the relative insolubility of CsA in water increases the risk ofcrystallization of CsA with time. Furthermore, the replacement ofethanol with Dulcilarmes/C210results in a 0.1% CsA solution with anapproximate osmolality of 430 mOsmol/kg that is signiﬁcantlymore hypertonic than the tear ﬂuid (mean value 303.7 mOsmol/
kg) and is potentially a trigger for ocular surface inﬂammation[48]. In contrast, Chast et al. [49] developed an oily solution withone part of Sandimmune/C210oral solution diluted in four parts of
kg) and is potentially a trigger for ocular surface inﬂammation[48]. In contrast, Chast et al. [49] developed an oily solution withone part of Sandimmune/C210oral solution diluted in four parts ofcastor oil, both constituents ﬁltered under laminar ﬂow using0.22- lm ﬁlters to ensure sterility of the ﬁnal preparation. This oilyinjection solution contained less ethanol from the Sandimmune/C21018 F. Lallemand et al. / European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 117 (2017) 14–28
solution and was stable at room temperature even after 12 monthsof storage, preserving nearly 98.5% of the CsA content as the theo-retical initial concentration. Nonetheless, the packaging vials wereproduced as multi-dose containers, necessitating monitoring of thesterility of the product throughout the period in use. There were noadverse events observed in the 250 patients in whom this productwas used for the prevention of graft rejection or in immune diseaseof corneal tissue, demonstrating the tolerability and suitability ofthis vehicle for use as eye drops [49]. The long-term stability andsterility of CsA was further optimized for daily use by patients bypackaging in an easy to handle, low-density polyethylene con-tainer [50].Table 3 summarizes the differences between hospital-compounded preparations of CsA eye drops that could impact thetolerance and efﬁcacy of the product. If Sandimmune/C210(oral andintravenous formulations) were not available, pharmacies would
need to resort to handling CsA raw material, which requires speci-ﬁc protective equipment to guarantee the safety of operatorsbecause of its CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduc-tion) classiﬁcation [51–53] . Moreover, every preparation of theproduct would need to be validated to ensure shelf-life stability.Therefore, access to ready-to-use CsA products consistent withlarge-scale production according to Good Manufacturing Practices(GMP) would complement the supply of hospital-compoundedpreparations to the advantage of both patients andophthalmologists.4. Products in commercial development4.1. MC2BIOTEK (PADcicloTM)PADcicloTM, being developed by the Danish biotech companyMC2BIOTEK, comprises a dispersion of polyaphrons encapsulatingCsA within oily micrometer-sized aphrons dispersed in a hydrogelof carbomer [54,55] . Polyaphrons are lipid-based formulations ﬁrstdescribed in the late 1970s [56]. The main advantage of polyaph-
rons over an emulsion is the high concentration of the dispersedoil phase that is nearly up to 90% in proprietary formulations[57]. Moreover, the proportion of surfactant required to maintainstability of the dispersed phase is very low, typically less than0.5%, resulting in a surfactant-to-oil ratio that is much lower thanthat of emulsions. These attributes make polyaphrons a good vehi-cle for ocular delivery. However, their cream-like viscosity canmake them unsuitable for topical ocular administration. Hence,polyaphrons are more desirable when dispersed in an aqueousvehicle containing a viscosifying agent that not only results in aproduct with the desired viscosity (i.e. avoids creaming by inhibit-ing the motion of individual aphrons) but also ensures the long-term physical stability of the product by inhibiting motion of indi-vidual globules.A phase II clinical trial evaluating the safety and efﬁcacy of twodosages of PADciclo
dosages of PADcicloTMadministered once daily (0.03% and 0.06% w/w CsA) was launched in the summer of 2015 [54]. The CsA concen-trations in PADcicloTMare slightly lower than those of existinglicensed products (Restasis/C2100.05% CsA bid and Ikervis/C2100.1% CsAqd), suggesting that the polyaphron technology may improve ocu-lar delivery of CsA. Recent preclinical pharmacokinetic datademonstrated negligible systemic CsA exposure, but after multipletopical PADcicloTMadministrations, the conjunctival and cornealpenetration of CsA was up to ﬁvefold higher than that achievedwith Restasis/C210[58]. Since 2012, PADcicloTMhas been used by1000+ patients in the UK through a special program at the Moors-ﬁeld Eye Hospital [59], although clinical data in these patients hasnot been made available.4.2. NOVALIQ (CyclASol/C210)Novaliq GmbH is currently developing CyclASol/C210, a non-aqueous preservative-free solution of CsA formulated using its
proprietary EyeSolTMtechnology. This novel technology uses semi-ﬂuorinated alkanes (SFAs) to dissolve poorly water-soluble drugs
aqueous preservative-free solution of CsA formulated using itsproprietary EyeSolTMtechnology. This novel technology uses semi-ﬂuorinated alkanes (SFAs) to dissolve poorly water-soluble drugssuch as CsA [60]. The drug delivery platform increases the disper-sion of CsA and increases the stability of the drug by way of pre-venting hydrolytic reactions [60]. In addition, CyclASol/C210has beenshown to have greater tissue penetration than Restasis/C210in an ExVivo Eye Irritation Test (EVEIT) system. The penetration of thetwo 0.05% CsA SFA formulations (F4H5 and F6H8) into the anteriorchambers of the eye after short-term application was signiﬁcantlyhigher (the drug remained for at least 8.5 h) than that achievedwith Restasis/C210(0.05% CsA), which required repeated instillationsfor CsA penetration into the aqueous humor [61]. These resultssuggest that SFA-based formulations may be useful vehicles fordelivering drugs into intraocular tissues. In 2014, Novaliq com-
pleted a phase I clinical study evaluating the safety and local toler-ability of CyclASol/C210and the systemic exposure to CsA after singleand repeated ocular doses (up to four times per day) in 18 healthyTable 3Hospital-compounded preparations of cyclosporine A eye drops.CsA starting material Oil/solvents Other components Concentration CsA(% w/w)ReferencesDilution of Sandimmune/C210(50 mg/mL injectable)Artiﬁcial tears (Dulcilarmes/C210)Saline solutionEthanol (± evaporated) ± polysorbate orCremophor ± glycerol ± artiﬁcial tears0.1–2% Bontemps et al.

volunteers; there were no reports of drug-related signs or symp-toms of ocular discomfort, systemic CsA exposure or alterationsin the anterior or posterior eye structures [62]. In 2016 Novaliqconducted a phase 2 randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, multi-center US study with four treatment groups,including two CyclASol/C210groups (0.05% and 0.1%), an open-labelactive control (Restasis/C210), and a vehicle control group [63]. 207patients with moderate to severe dry eye disease were enrolled.Both CyclASol/C210groups showed a signiﬁcant improvement in cor-neal staining compared with the vehicle over the 4-month treat-ment period. In particular, the central area of the cornea seemedto beneﬁt most, an important aspect for visual function in dryeye patients. All treatment groups demonstrated improvement insymptoms, with CyclASol/C210showing improvements over vehicle
in subgroups. The data further indicated an early onset of actionby reduction in corneal and conjunctival staining in as little as14 days. It is worth noting that the vehicle group also showed sig-niﬁcant improvements in symptoms.Novaliq (through Ursapharm) currently markets EvoTears/C210,which are also eye drops based on the EyeSolTMSFA technology,designed as a nonblurring wetting lubricant for the ocular surface[64]. The low viscosity and surface tension of this SFA solutionresults in a much smaller drop size compared with an aqueoussolution drop. This property makes an SFA solution suitable forocular instillation by reducing reﬂex blinking and blurring.4.3. APIDEL (ApidSOLTM)Apidel is a Geneva, Switzerland-based drug delivery companycurrently developing the ApidSOLTMnanocarrier technology [65].ApidSOLTMnanocarriers are composed of methoxy poly(ethyleneglycol) hexyl-substituted poly(lactic acid) polymers that efﬁciently
solubilize lipophilic drugs. Besides an enhanced solubilizationcapacity (up to 6 mg/mL; 500-fold of water solubility), ApidSOLTMnanocarriers have a very low CMC (8 mg/L), which suggests highstability [66,67] . A promising product in Apidel’s ophthalmicdevelopment pipeline is CsA ApidSOLTM, a transparent, colloidalaqueous solution of CsA. Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies havedemonstrated a favorable safety proﬁle for ApidSOLTMtechnology inseveral species [68–70] . Furthermore, superior corneal delivery ofCsA with CsA ApidSOLTMcompared with Restasis/C210or oil-basedCsA solutions has also been demonstrated [68]. A comparative ocu-lar distribution study of CsA after repeated instillation (bid for5 days) of 0.05% CsA ApidSOLTMor Restasis/C210into rat eyes demon-strated signiﬁcant corneal drug deposition for the polymericnanocarrier formulation CsA ApidSOLTM, but not for Restasis/C210. Morespeciﬁcally, after the instillation of CsA ApidSOLTM, 1540 ± 400 ng
per gram tissue of CsA was recovered in the cornea, whereas thecorneal CsA concentration after Restasis/C210instillation was belowthe limit of quantiﬁcation (2 ng/mL) in all but one rat (n = 6)[68]. This same trend was observed in another comparative studyafter repeated instillation (ﬁve times per day over 5 days) of 0.5%CsA ApidSOLTMand 0.5% CsA oily solution that reported CsA cornealconcentrations of 6470 ± 1730 ng per gram tissue and 580 ± 110 ngper gram tissue for the polymeric nanocarrier formulation and oilysolution, respectively [70]. While the lachrymal ﬂuid concentrationwas similar after administration of 0.05% CsA ApidSOLTMor Resta-sis/C210(AUC 2339 ± 1032 min /C2lg/mL and 2321 ± 881 min /C2lg/mL), the polymeric nanocarrier formulation was better tolerated[68]. As determined by confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscopy,the tolerance proﬁle of 0.05% CsA ApidSOLTM(four instillations(50lL each) per day for 3 days) was similar to the proﬁle of a sal-
ine solution (0.9%) [69].These results are consistent with those observed with SFA for-mulations, demonstrating that micellar nanocarriers encapsulating
ine solution (0.9%) [69].These results are consistent with those observed with SFA for-mulations, demonstrating that micellar nanocarriers encapsulatingCsA are able to enhance transcorneal penetration when comparedwith Restasis/C210-like emulsions, which predominantly affect the sur-face and require multiple instillations to penetrate into the cornea.4.4. OthersA monocentric, randomized, noncomparative clinical trialincluding 92 patients (92 eyes) was conducted between May2003 and June 2011 at the Shandong Eye Institute, China, to eval-uate the effect of CsA on the prevention of rejection after high-riskcorneal transplantation [71]. The CsA preparation used in the trialwas a sustained-release implant made of poly(lactide- co-glycolide-co-caprolactone) (PLGC). CsA and PLGC were ﬁrst dissolved in chlo-roform, and the solution was ﬁlter-sterilized, lyophilized andshaped into 2-mg cylinders (0.20 mm /C20.65 mm), each containing
1.0 mg CsA. Implants were then injected into the anterior chamberduring the keratoplasty surgical procedure, and outcomes wereassessed at 6 months [71]. Treatment was successful in 81 eyes(88%), partially successful (no rejection after rescue medication)in seven eyes (7.6%) and failed (graft rejection) in four eyes(4.3%). The mean graft survival was 36.1 ± 17.7 months (range12.3–61.6 months), and on average, the drug delivery system(DDS) degraded in 7.6 ± 4.3 months (range 5–13 months). Therewere no safety signals from the assessments of endothelial celldensity and iris status. The CsA sustained-release DDS used in thisstudy appears to be suitable for long-term prophylaxis of immunerejection after high-risk keratoplasty. The main advantage of thisDDS is its ability to effectively deliver CsA over several months fol-lowing a single minimally invasive injection.5. Cyclosporine A formulations in academic researchSince the 2003 review of ocular CsA delivery systems by
Lallemand et al. [4], there has been a steady increase in the numberof academic publications on this topic, reﬂecting the strong medi-cal need for new delivery options. In this section, we will ﬁrst focuson topical delivery to treat front-of-the-eye conditions and thendescribe the ongoing research efforts to administer CsA via intra-or periocular injection procedures.5.1. Topical formulationsThe topical delivery of CsA can be divided into two main cate-gories: (1) colloidal dosage forms based on submicron particlessuspended in an aqueous phase and (2) other delivery systems,including suspended microspheres and solid dosage forms.5.1.1. Colloidal vectors (nanometer size)Colloidal vectors are submicron particles suspended in an aque-ous solution and include several different types of nanoparticles.Nanoparticles have been tested as CsA carriers for more than20 years; however, no clinical study has been conducted with
nanoparticles to date, probably due to the complexity and costsof manufacture, as well as the low drug-loading capabilities ofnanoparticles.5.1.2. Chitosan nanoparticlesChitosan is a cationic biopolymer that possesses mucus-likebioadhesive properties and a favorable ocular tolerance [72].Aproof-of-concept study in 2001 described chitosan as a potentialcolloidal carrier for CsA [73]. No further development was reporteduntil Basaran et al. [74] made nanoparticles of chitosan by spray-drying a hydroethanolic solution of CsA and chitosan, producingquite a low encapsulation rate (CsA concentrations in the ﬁnal for-mulation of 0.05% and 0.125% w/w). The nanoparticles were resus-pended in water and sterilized by autoclaving, with a procedural20 F. Lallemand et al. / European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 117 (2017) 14–28
drug loss of about 7%. A pharmacokinetic study after single instil-lation of 500 lL in sheep eyes showed that the approximate CsAconcentrations in aqueous and vitreous humors were 30–40 ng/mL, a level that is insufﬁcient to induce immunosuppressive action[74]. However, the authors did not assess the CsA concentration inthe cornea and conjunctiva to enable comparison with other deliv-ery systems. The choice of sheep eyes for such a study is quite unu-sual, and the instillation volume (500 lL) was much larger thanthat typically used in humans (average drop size of several com-mercial topical ophthalmic solutions is approximately 40 lL, andoverﬁlled liquid is eliminated) [75]. In summary, although the con-cept of chitosan nanoparticles as CsA delivery vehicles seemspromising, additional data and comparative studies demonstratingtheir efﬁcacy and safety when compared with other technologiesare required to establish the utility of this drug delivery system.
Other cationic nanoparticles described by Hermans et al. [76]included a poly(lactic- co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) core coated withchitosan to increase precorneal residence time and drug absorp-tion. This publication only demonstrated an in vitro toxicity studyon human epithelial cells, and additional work is needed to evalu-ate its real potential.5.1.3. Liquid crystalline nanoparticlesChen et al. [77] described a liquid crystalline nanoparticles for-mulation containing CsA-loaded (1%) glyceryl monooleate andpoloxamer 407. An in vivo (rabbit eyes) study of a prototype formu-lation demonstrated a signiﬁcantly higher corneal penetrationcompared with oil solutions, and the Draize test did not showany signs of toxicity. Such nanoparticles have a high encapsulationrate due to their lipophilic core and use of compendial excipient.While these nanoparticles are simple to manufacture without theuse of organic solvents, there is a signiﬁcant cost associated with
sterilization and validation of a full aseptic process. Further phar-macokinetic and pharmacodynamic data are needed to betterunderstand the potential of this DDS.5.1.4. Nanostructured lipid carriersShen et al. [78] have described a new drug delivery approachusing lipid nanoparticles of 60–70 nm developed by solidiﬁcationof a new excipient, thiolated polyethylene glycol monostearate,which is essentially a combination of a fatty acid and a surfactant.The oily core used in these particles allows for a surprisingly highencapsulation of CsA ( /C241% w/w) in the formulation. When instilledinto the eyes of rabbits (twice at 90-s intervals), high tear concen-trations were maintained for up to 6 h without any sign of irrita-tion. This high retention time may be due to the bioadhesion ofthe nanoparticles to tear mucins via the thiol group present atthe nanoparticle surface. Given their small size, these novelnanoparticles could be sterilized easily by ﬁltration, a feature that
makes them particularly interesting for ocular delivery. A limita-tion for this technology is the extensive and costly regulatory tox-icity studies that will be required for this novel excipient, whichcould pose a signiﬁcant hurdle to engaging an industrial partner.In a follow-up study, Shen et al. [79] undertook an extensive phar-macokinetic study in rabbit ocular tissues after instillation of 25lLof the prototype. They demonstrated that these nanoparticlescould deliver therapeutic tissue concentrations of CsA (cornea,conjunctiva, iris-ciliary body) for up to 24 h post-instillation.Nonetheless, further investigation of these nanoparticles will berequired to validate the utility of these nanoparticles as an oculardelivery vehicle.5.1.5. Solid lipid nanoparticlesGokce et al. [80] also described a slightly different approachfrom that of Shen et al. [78,79] by developing solid lipid nanopar-
delivery vehicle.5.1.5. Solid lipid nanoparticlesGokce et al. [80] also described a slightly different approachfrom that of Shen et al. [78,79] by developing solid lipid nanopar-ticles loaded with 0.05% CsA within a solid glyceryl dibehenatelipid core stabilized by poloxamer 188 and Tween 80. Interestingly,the integrity of the prototype suspension (polydispersity index andzeta potential) survived heat sterilization. In a non-comparativepharmacokinetic study in rabbit eyes, high CsA concentrationswere detected in the aqueous humor, but no assessments of cor-neal and conjunctival CsA concentrations were done, making it dif-ﬁcult to interpret the comprehensive ability of these lipidnanoparticles as a DDS.5.1.6. Poly- e-caprolactone nanoparticlesYenice et al. [81] pursued a poly- e-caprolactone nanoparticleapproach made by a nanoprecipitation technique using acetoneas the organic solvent. This process differed from that used for pre-
viously developed particles [82] in that they were coated with hya-luronic acid (HA), a natural polymer, which improves interactionswith ocular surface mucins. The HA coating was achieved by anelectrostatic attraction between negatively charged HA polymerand the cationic surfactant (BAK) used in the formulation. Theencapsulation efﬁciency of the poly- e-caprolactone nanoparticleswas similar to that of other nanoparticles, with a ﬁnal CsA concen-tration of 0.1%. In a pharmacokinetic study in rabbits, corneal andconjunctival CsA concentrations were higher following four instil-lations (25lL at 10-min intervals) of the nanoparticle suspensioncompared with instillation of a 0.1% CsA castor oil formulation[81]. Unfortunately, tolerability was not evaluated in this study,which is a concern since this formulation was prepared with anorganic solvent and contains BAK. This is particularly importantfor patients with severe ocular conditions, given the potential for
deleterious effects of BAK on the ocular surface.5.1.7. Cyclodextrin nanoparticlesAn interesting combination of a- and c-cyclodextrins wasdescribed by Johannsdottir et al. [83] with the objective of devel-oping a surfactant-free CsA solution. The a-cyclodextrin solubi-lized 0.05% CsA in an aqueous solution, whereas c-cyclodextrinpromoted the formation of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles based onthese well-characterized sugars could be an alternative to otherpolymer nanoparticles. Further investigation of this approach iswarranted to establish the utility of these nanoparticles. However,it can be noted that corneal irritation potential has been reportedfora-cyclodextrins and RM- b-cyclodextrins for concentrationsabove 4% and 5%, respectively. Other types of cyclodextrins, e.g.HP-b-cyclodextrins and SBE- b-cyclodextrins, appear to be safer,with no issues reported for concentrations up to 12.5% and 10%respectively. [84]5.1.8. Mucoadhesive nanoparticles
5.1.8. Mucoadhesive nanoparticlesA recent study by Liu et al [85] showed promising results forphenylboronic acid (PBA)-modiﬁed, CsA-loaded poly( D,L-lacticacid) + dextran (PLA- b-Dex) nanoparticles in the treatment oflong-term experimental DED in mice. Once-weekly administrationof these mucoadhesive nanoparticles eye drops (0.005–0.01% CsA)demonstrated prolonged ocular surface retention and effectivetreatment of dry eye conditions with up to 50- to 100-fold reduc-tion in overall dosage of CsA compared with thrice-weeklyRestasis/C210.5.1.9. LiposomesLiposomes were described many years ago for the topicaladministration of CsA [86] but failed to reach the market due toissues with large-scale production and stability. Of note, most pro-duction processes for liposomes use organic solvents, which mustbe removed in order to comply with the residual solvent speciﬁca-tions of the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) on the
Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [87].

costs. Since phospholipids naturally oxidize with environmentaloxygen, liposomal products must be freeze-dried or packaged inan inert atmosphere. Nevertheless, liposomes are academicallyinteresting, and there is a lot of work in drug delivery with thistype of preparation.Recent work reports a novel formulation of liposomal CsA usinga supercritical ﬂuid of carbon dioxide (SCF-CO 2) method in order toaddress the challenges of liposome preparation [88]. In brief, excip-ients and CsA were solubilized in ethanol and submitted to SCF-CO2ﬂow to eliminate solvent, and the resultant liposomes werethen hydrated with water. These liposomes were smaller than con-ventional liposomes with similar drug loading. In a dry eye modelin rabbits, the liposomes showed better tolerance, improved tearproduction in dry eyes and resulted in a higher CsA tear ﬁlm con-centration compared with Restasis/C210. This promising proof of con-cept deserves further development for testing on a larger scale
[89].Li et al. [90] investigated a CsA-loaded (0.1%) liposomal formu-lation coated with positively charged low-molecular-weight chi-tosan to confer bioadhesiveness to liposomes. A pharmacokineticevaluation in rabbits (single ocular administration of 100 lL)showed that the chitosan-coated particles resulted in a signiﬁ-cantly greater CsA penetration, especially into the cornea, com-pared with noncoated liposomes. As chitosan is usuallyconsidered to be nontoxic, this approach could be promising,although there remain uncertainties about the manufacturingand sterilization process and the stability of these liposomes. Asafety study of liposomes suspended in a carbomer solution witha ﬁnal CsA concentration of 0.2%, described by Mosallaei et al.,showed no signiﬁcant toxicity; however, this study did not reportany data on ocular penetration [91].5.1.10. MicellesAnother way to solubilize CsA in water is to use micelles.
Although this DDS was described a long time ago, it was not partic-ularly successful due to the poor stability of such a dynamic system[4]. This approach is still being intensely investigated by Di Tom-maso et al., as explained in Section 4.3above [66,68–70] , and therehave also been several recent publications on this topic.In 2014, Luschmann [92] described the use of three surfactantsolutions of ceteareth-20 (5%), steareth-20 (5%) and macrogol(15)-hydroxystearate (10%) to solubilize CsA up to 0.1% w/v. Theseformulations are simple and easy to manufacture and can be ster-ilized by ﬁltration. In a study on excised porcine cornea, these solu-tions showed a higher penetration rate than Restasis/C210or an oilsolution of CsA [92], conﬁrming the potential of micelles as aDDS, similar to descriptions by Kuwano et al., who demonstratedan increased ocular bioavailability when CsA was formulated as amicellar solution vs. an emulsion or an oily solution [40]. However,
at surfactant concentrations of 5% and 10%, ocular irritation may beobserved, especially after long-term use, and on-shelf stability dataon these micelles have not yet been reported.In a different study, Cholkar et al. [93] constructed micelles withhydrogenated castor oil-40 (Cremophor RH 40) and octoxynol-40capable of solubilizing CsA in an aqueous solution up to 0.1%.The production method involved ethanol evaporation and ﬁlmrehydration. Pharmacokinetic studies (single 35lL dose and mul-tiple doses of four instillations per day for 5 days) performed inrabbits showed therapeutic concentration of CsA s in all front-of-the-eye tissues (cornea, conjunctiva, sclera). These data once againdemonstrate that a simple formulation can be useful in the oculardelivery of CsA. Unfortunately, there are no available data compar-ing this formulation to Restasis/C210or other vehicles or that show thepotential irritation from this mixture of surfactants after several
days of administration.5.1.11. Other dosage forms
ing this formulation to Restasis/C210or other vehicles or that show thepotential irritation from this mixture of surfactants after severaldays of administration.5.1.11. Other dosage formsThe following sections describe aqueous suspensions of micro-spheres and emulsions, as well as solid dosage forms such as lensesand inserts.5.1.11.1. Microspheres. Wolska and Sznitowska [94] have recentlyinvestigated the microsphere approach to deliver CsA to the ocularsurface. Microspheres contain a lipid matrix of triglycerides, glyc-eryl palmitostearate or glyceryl behenate stabilized by the surfac-tant Tween 80. A signiﬁcant advantage of this type of formulationover other CsA DDSs is its high content of lipids, which allows forthe encapsulation of up to 2% of CsA. The prototypes were shownto withstand heat sterilization at 121 /C176C for 15 min without degra-dation, and the typical particle size in this formulation wasbetween 1 and 10 lm. Although this formulation has its advan-
tages, the physical stability of a suspension containing particlesof this size is still unclear. Moreover, the behavior of the particlesafter topical administration remains to be examined. It appearsthat a bioadhesion mechanism is not employed in this DDS, whichmay limit the residence time and ocular penetration of CsA whenusing this formulation. In addition, the lipids used for suchformulations have a high melting point and are solid at roomtemperature, although this could be easily avoided by mixing thehigh-melting-point lipid with a low-melting-point lipid, for exam-ple MCTs or ethyl oleate, creating liquid lipid clusters within theparticles wherein the drug could remain dissolved.5.1.11.2. Emulsions/emulsions in gel. The ﬁrst CsA emulsion wasmarketed as an ocular product in 2003, and three products are cur-rently available: Restasis/C210, Lacrinmune/C210and Ikervis/C210. Emulsionsand hydrogels have interesting features, and it is therefore
expected that a combination of features of these two technologieswould be advantageous for ocular delivery of CsA. Such a formula-tion may increase retention time, stability and potentially tolera-bility by wetting and lubricating the ocular surface. Gan et al.[95] have added hydrogels of gellan gum or Carbopol/C210980 to anemulsion of 0.2% CsA (castor oil stabilized by macrogol (15)-hydroxystearate). The potential effect of these viscosifying agentsis to enhance retention time on the ocular surface as well asincrease ocular tissue penetration. In an in vivo pharmacokineticstudy in rabbits, 100 lL was instilled twice a day for 1 week. At24 and 32 h after the ﬁnal instillation, corneal CsA concentrationswere signiﬁcantly higher with the CsA emulsion-gel than withthe control (a CsA emulsion similar to Restasis/C210, but withoutgel); however, conjunctival CsA levels were not signiﬁcantly differ-ent. The emulsion-gel tested in this study contained a higher CsA
concentration than the control (0.2% versus 0.05%) suggesting thatthe emulsion-gel had no signiﬁcant advantage over a conventionalemulsion in terms of ocular penetration.Shen et al. [96] developed a 0.5% CsA emulsion gel using castoroil, ethanol and poloxamer 188. The gel also contained polycar-bophil and water isotonized by glycerol, resulting in a white-colored, viscous and creamy product. When administered to rabbiteyes, the gel was nontoxic and tear CsA concentrations were signif-icantly higher than concentrations achieved with a CsA castor oilsolution. Although these preliminary results are promising, furtherstudies are needed to establish the safety and efﬁcacy of this for-mulation. In our opinion, the use of ethanol should be avoideddue to potential safety issues, irrespective of whether it evaporates.The formulation should also be further characterized, since the sizeand zeta potential of the oil droplets could potentially inﬂuence the
stability, retention time and CsA penetration of the emulsion. In
and zeta potential of the oil droplets could potentially inﬂuence thestability, retention time and CsA penetration of the emulsion. Inaddition, the sterilization of the formulation needs to be assessed.Finally, a pharmacokinetic study is warranted to validate theadvantage of this dosage form over already commercially availableproducts such as Restasis/C210and Ikervis/C210.22 F.

5.1.11.3. Hydrogels. Hydrogels are commonly used in ophthalmol-ogy to increase the retention time of a drug after topical adminis-tration. They act either by corneal bioadhesion or simply by theirhigh viscosity, which limits their elimination from the eye surface.However, when viscosity is too high, administration of the gel tothe ocular surface can be difﬁcult and could cause discomfort forpatients. Therefore, in situ gelling systems have been developedthat gel upon contact with the eye [97]. Wu et al. [98] have exten-sively studied a thermosensitive HA in situ gelling system for CsAdelivery. A novel co-polymer was synthetized using HA-g-poly-isopropylacrylamide (2% w/w), capable of gelling at 32 /C176C, whichis similar to the corneal surface temperature (34 /C176C). In addition,this co-polymer rearranges into microgels with lipophilic corescapable of encapsulating CsA. Drug loading was successfully
achieved by combining the polymer solution with a methanolCsA solution. After evaporation of the solvent, any free CsA wasremoved by centrifugation and dialysis. While the Draize testrevealed no signiﬁcant irritation after a single instillation (25lL)of the product, the long-term tolerability of this product is yet tobe determined. In a pharmacokinetic study, six instillations ofthe prototype, an oil solution with the same concentration ofCsA, and Restasis/C210were applied at 10-min intervals to rabbit eyes.The tear, corneal and conjunctival CsA concentrations were similarbetween the hydrogel, castor oil and eye drop formulations at alltime points except at 24 h, wherein the hydrogel applicationresulted in signiﬁcantly greater CsA concentrations in the corneaand conjunctiva. This DDS, while interesting, may not be a goodcandidate to progress into further stages of development giventhe poor pharmacokinetic results reported to date, as well as the
complex process involved in manufacturing this new chemicalentity.5.1.11.4. Contact lenses. The use of contact lenses with active ingre-dients is a well-investigated DDS, with some experimental suc-cesses [99]. Kapoor et al. [100] used this approach to incorporateCsA into HEMA (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) contact lensesusing two strategies: (1) by entrapping a CsA microemulsion viapolymerization of poly-HEMA (p-HEMA) hydrogel and (2) bydirectly including CsA polyoxyethylene oleoyl ether micelles inthe HEMA gel. In vitro studies showed that both prototypesreleased CsA for up to 20 days. Since p-HEMA hydrogels are cap-able of withstanding heat sterilization without damage [101] ,i tcan be hypothesized that the lens could also be potentially steril-ized by moist heat without degradation. The results of this studywere published in 2008, after which there have been no other pub-lications to support this DDS [100] .
lications to support this DDS [100] .Another team used silicone-based contact lenses to administerCsA [102] . In this approach, contact lenses were soaked in a17lg/mL CsA solution for 7 days, and drug loading throughhydrophobic diffusion was driven by the difference between thepartition coefﬁcients of the solution and the hydrophobic lens core.At best, the lens could absorb 110 lg of CsA, and in vitro studiesdemonstrated sustained CsA release over 2 weeks, which couldbe prolonged up to 1 month with the addition of vitamin E to thelens. Despite these interesting results, as in the previous example,no further updates in support of this DDS approach have been pub-lished to date.Loaded contact lenses are an attractive approach because themanufacturing process is quite easy and the higher concentrationof drug loaded into these lenses could support sustained releaseover several weeks. However, it is well known that the use of con-
tact lenses in patients with dry eye or ocular surface inﬂammationcan exacerbate symptoms or disease progression. Hence, CsA-loaded contact lenses may not be suitable for the treatment of
tact lenses in patients with dry eye or ocular surface inﬂammationcan exacerbate symptoms or disease progression. Hence, CsA-loaded contact lenses may not be suitable for the treatment ofDED or other associated diseases. Nevertheless, this DDS may beapplicable to deliver CsA for the treatment of other ocular condi-tions such as corneal graft rejection and rosacea.5.1.11.5. Ocular inserts. The ﬁrst prototype for ocular inserts weredescribed in the 1970s [103] and involved the insertion of a soliddosage form into the lower conjunctival cul-de-sac that releasedactive drug for several hours to several days. However, despitetheir overwhelming potential, the initial commercialized productsfailed, and the use of this DDS was abandoned for many years dueto the discomfort associated with placement of the insert experi-enced by patients. Recently, Gupta et al. [104] described a newocular insert prototype for the ocular delivery of CsA. These inserts
were made of nonbiodegradable p-HEMA and ethylene glycoldimethacrylate, which are both polymers commonly used in con-tact lenses and are capable of CsA loading up to 30%, with an aver-age release rate of approximately 10–20lg/day. Althoughpromising, this research has not progressed beyond in vitro studies.Anin vivo pharmacokinetic study evaluating the release rate andocular bioavailability of CsA using this DDS is primarily neededfor further assessment. Also, the development of an insertiondevice to easily administer and facilitate placement of the insertin the cul-de-sac by the patient would be beneﬁcial. In our opinion,the insert should be made of a biodegradable polymer to reducepatient discomfort.5.2. Injectable formulationsDespite signiﬁcant advances in the topical delivery of CsA, thedevelopment of speciﬁc DDSs for sustained drug release or effec-tive delivery of active drugs to the posterior segment still remains
a challenge. Presently, delivery of CsA to the back of eye can onlybe achieved through invasive intravitreal, subconjunctival, intra-cameral, suprachoroidal or episcleral injections. Several differentdrug delivery approaches to speciﬁcally deliver active drug to theback of the eye have been tested, as discussed below.5.2.1. MicrospheresHe et al. [105,106] described the in vivo evaluation of PLGAmicrospheres, approximately 50 lm in diameter, loaded with CsAformulated using a solvent evaporation process. When this formu-lation was injected into the vitreous humor in uveitis-induced rab-bit eyes, the severity of the inﬂammation signiﬁcantly decreased4 weeks post-injection. There were also no signs of apparent toxi-city [106] . These preliminary results are promising, though somecritical technical issues in the formulation process, such as use ofmethylene chloride (a class 2 solvent regulated by the ICH), needto be addressed [87]. The processes used for sterilization of the
particles and reconstitution into a homogeneous suspension mustalso be considered. Given the particle size, a 25-gauge needle,which is larger than the standard recommendation (30-gauge nee-dle to limit the size of the perforation made in the sclera), may berequired to inject these microspheres into the vitreous humor.Finally, it would be essential to determine the CsA release rate ofthis formulation in order to avoid the need for repeated injections.In our opinion, a 6-month period would be an ideal release rate todecrease the need for frequent injections.5.2.2. ImplantsImplants are solid dosage forms that act as reservoirs for sus-tained release of active ingredients. Presently, both biodegradableand nonbiodegradable implants are available that can beimplanted in several sites within the eye. Acton et al. [107] testeda subconjunctival silicone implant of CsA in a red wolf sufferingfrom KCS. The successful outcome observed from this single case
demonstrated the potential of this DDS and paved the way for fur-

Episcleral injection (i.e. injection in the outer layer of the sclera)is not a common route of administration but is a promisingapproach that warrants further investigation. Kim et al. [108]developed a silicone-based episcleral CsA implant with a potentialrelease time of 150 days [109] . After implantation into rabbit eyes,they noted that most of the front-of-the-eye organs (lacrimalgland, conjunctiva and cornea) and the aqueous humor retainedtherapeutic CsA concentrations for up to 6 months, but the CsAconcentration in the vitreous humor remained below therapeuticlevels. A pharmacodynamic study performed in dogs with KCSshowed improvements in Schirmer’s test scores compared withbaseline and resolution of the signs of keratitis. The implantappeared to be safe and did not display any signs of toxicity[108] . A potential limitation of this implant is the nonbiodegrad-ability of silicone, which could impact post-treatment status.
A recent retrospective study (2005–2013) of the episcleral CsAsilicone implant in horses with immune-related keratitis reportedthat the implant was associated with long-term efﬁcacy and wasalso well tolerated [110] . However, as described by Kim et al.[108] , implantation is a surgical procedure, and the fate of thespent insert needs to be considered prior to implantation.Biodegradable implants have the advantage of eliminating theneed for implant removal and/or the potential risks associatedwith the accumulation of spent implants.

technology (PLGA implant of dexamethasone, Allergan), an implantof 0.5 mg CsA was surgically placed in the anterior chamber of theeyes of rabbits [111] . The implant was efﬁcient in maintaining ahigh corneal concentration of CsA for 3 months, providing proofof principle for use in preventing corneal graft rejection. However,no further work on this implant has been published since 2003.An intravitreal CsA implant, 1.5 mm in diameter and 2 mm inlength made of a new biodegradable copolymer, glycolide- co-lactide- co-caprolactone, developed by Dong et al. was surgicallyimplanted in a rabbit model of chronic uveitis [112] . Post-implantation, a decrease in inﬂammation and an absence of anysigns of toxicity were observed. Of note, 14 weeks post-implantation, 257.3 ng/mL of CsA was found in the vitreous humor,demonstrating that this new formulation could support sustainedCsA release for up to 3 months. Since publication of the Dong
et al. results in 2006, no additional work has been reported usingthis new co-polymer. One reason for this might be the regulatoryhurdle of using a new polymer, which requires a complete toxicityevaluation prior to initiation of clinical trials on human subjects.Gilger et al. [113] described the evaluation of a scleral implantof CsA (10% w/w) formulated using a pellet of CsA powder and apolyvinyl alcohol polymer. In this study, only deep scleral layerimplantation in horses with equine recurrent uveitis effectivelycontrolled uveitis when compared with implantation in the epis-cleral space. This implantation site has the advantage of bypassingthe scleral barrier and directly delivering CsA to the choroid, whereinﬂammation is concentrated. Despite the need for surgery, thisdevice seems to have several advantages in term of sustainedTable 5Summary of key studies.Reference Study type Key Findings

Based on data at6 months, the implants appeared to be suitable for long-term prophylaxis ofimmune rejection, and there were no safety signals from the assessments ofendothelial cell density and iris status. This system was able to effectively deliverCsA over several months following a single minimally invasive injectionWolska et al.[94]In vitro This study investigated microspheres, which contain a lipid matrix oftriglycerides, glyceryl palmitostearate, or glyceryl behenate stabilized by the
surfactant Tween 80. A signiﬁcant advantage of this type of CsA delivery systemis its high lipid content, which allows for encapsulation of up to 2% CsA.Prototypes were shown to withstand heat sterilization at 121 /C176C for 15 minwithout degradation, and the typical particle size was 1–10lm. The physicalstability of a suspension containing particles of this size is unclear. Moreover, itappears that a bioadhesion mechanism is not employed, which may limitresidence time and ocular penetration of CsAGupta et al.[104]In vitro This study described a new ocular insert prototype for delivery of CsA made ofnonbiodegradable p-HEMA and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate; both arepolymers commonly used in contact lenses and are capable of CsA loading up to30%, with an average release rate of approximately 10–20lg/day.

release, safety and achievement of therapeutic concentrations inthe choroid.A novel approach has been described by Eperon et al. [114]wherein a PLGA CsA- and triamcinolone-loaded implant wasattached to an intraocular lens as a replacement lens for treatingsurgery-related uveitis. Cataract surgery was performed in a rabbitmodel of induced uveitis to evaluate the anti-inﬂammatory effectof the implant at different time points (up to 79 days). Signs ofinﬂammation were signiﬁcantly reduced at most time points. Atthe end of the experiment, the implants retained 60% of the CsAthat was originally loaded, suggesting that these devices could sup-port sustained CsA release for several additional months. Thisapproach is quite promising because it uses an approved polymer,the device can be sterilized by radiation, and it is implanted at thetime of surgery, thereby obviating an additional invasive proce-dure. We hope to see further work using this approach in the nearfuture.
future.6. General conclusionsCompiling all the formulation approaches covered by Lallemandet al. [4]and this review ( Table 4 ), to date, more than 50 differentapproaches for the ocular delivery of CsA have been described,excluding several other technologies that are only described inpatents. From this larger group, ﬁndings from 11 key studies aresummarized in Table 5 . CsA remains the most challenging com-pound to formulate in a suitable dosage form, stimulating exten-sive research efforts to devise optimal ocular DDSs. Evenlatanoprost, one of the most prescribed drugs in ophthalmology,did not stimulate as much research or the development of as manyprototypes. We can say without a doubt that CsA is a textbook casein ophthalmic drug delivery.It should be noted that it remains difﬁcult to compare formula-tion types due to differences in protocols among prototypes,including the variability in CsA concentration (range: 0.05–2%),instillation volumes (range: 25–100
instillation volumes (range: 25–100lL), modes of administration,instillation frequency and the controls used as comparators in eachof these studies (typically Restasis/C210or an oil solution of CsA). Tol-erance has not always been evaluated, although it remains a keyfactor in deciding the therapeutic chosen for ocular surface dis-eases. At a minimum, a Draize test with a single administrationshould be conducted, and ideally an ocular tolerance study ofonce-daily administration for 28 days should be performed. Fur-thermore, although sterilization is a prerequisite for a commercialeye drop, sterilization procedures are not systematically discussedin the development of emerging DDSs. For even the most promis-ing academic prototypes, sterilization remains one of the mainissues to be solved before securing approval for clinical testing ofthe product in human subjects. In our opinion, industrial partner-ships should be initiated after completion of pharmacokinetic and
toxicity studies to encourage product development into the regula-tory approval and marketing authorization stages. Academicresearchers should also be mindful of the need to patent their for-mulations to gain additional value for their work and facilitateappropriate industrial collaborations.Restasis/C210in the US and Ikervis/C210in the EU are the two major andsuccessful emulsion products that are currently marketed to treatDED and other ocular surface diseases. Promising new technologiesthat could reach the market in the near future include polyaphronPADcicloTMfrom MC2BIOTEK and the semi-ﬂuorinated alkane solu-tion CyclASol/C210from Novaliq. The other drug delivery systemsdescribed in this review are still in the early stages of development.Although not optimal, hospital preparations, especially 2% CsAoil solutions, will probably continue to be used routinely until an
industrial product succeeds in providing equivalent amounts ofCsA concentration to the eye. Looking into the future, it would be
oil solutions, will probably continue to be used routinely until anindustrial product succeeds in providing equivalent amounts ofCsA concentration to the eye. Looking into the future, it would beinteresting to see which of these novel approaches will be the bestin class and which will gain global marketing authorization asstandard-of-care therapeutics for DED. Emulsions have thus farbeen the most reliable DDS, but this approach may be supplantedby one of the other formulations described in this review. Further-more, for convenience, it is likely that daily administration formu-lations will be replaced by sustained-release formulations.Although the invasive administration required for most of the cur-rently available sustained-release formulations is a drawback,future formulations should be developed such that self-administration allows for sustained drug release of at least severaldays to 1 week and ideally for 1–3 months. In the current list of
possible formulations, bioadhesive ocular inserts can beself-administered and also have the potential to release CsA overa 1-week period. Surprisingly, this dosage form has not beeninvestigated, probably due to previous commercial failures (e.g.Ocusert/C210[pilocarpine insert] and Lacrisert/C210[cellulose insert]).One further question that remains to be evaluated is the mostconvenient site for injecting these formulations into the eye. Forfront-of-the-eye conditions, a subconjunctival injection is prefer-able, whereas for the back-of-the-eye diseases, an intravitrealinjection remains the gold standard. Deep scleral injections mayalso be advantageous for back-of-the-eye delivery. With respectto the formulation, nanoparticles and microspheres are less inva-sive than larger implants and can release an active ingredient overa period of several months. In conclusion, we suggest that scien-tists focus on noninvasive sustained-release formulations that are
stable, sterile and nontoxic and demonstrate high levels of safety,efﬁcacy and tolerability.DisclosuresF. Lallemand, M. Schmitt and J.S. Garrigue are employees ofSanten SAS. J.-L.
