Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.A B S T R A C TBackgroundDiscoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic form of cutaneous lupus, which can cause scarring. Many drugs have been used to treatthis disease and some (such as thalidomide, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) are potentially toxic. This is an update of a CochraneReview first published in 2000, and previously updated in 2009. We wanted to update the review to assess whether any new informationwas available to treat DLE, as we were still unsure of the eﬀectiveness of available drugs and how to select the most appropriate treatmentfor an individual with DLE.ObjectivesTo assess the eﬀects of drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus.
Search methodsWe updated our searches of the following databases to 22 September 2016: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE,Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials databases, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references torelevant trials. Index Medicus (1956 to 1966) was handsearched and we approached authors for information about unpublished trials.Selection criteriaWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of drugs to treat people with DLE in any population group and of either gender.Comparisons included any drug used for DLE against either another drug or against placebo cream. We excluded laser treatment, surgery,phototherapy, other forms of physical therapy, and photoprotection as we did not consider them drug treatments.Data collection and analysisAt least two reviewers independently extracted data onto a data extraction sheet, resolving disagreements by discussion. We used standard
methods to assess risk of bias, as expected by Cochrane.Main resultsFive trials involving 197 participants were included. Three new trials were included in this update. None of the five trials were of high quality.'Risk of bias' assessments identified potential sources of bias in each study. One study used an inappropriate randomisation method, andincomplete outcome data were a concern in another as 15 people did not complete the trial. We found most of the trials to be at low riskin terms of blinding, but three of the five did not describe allocation concealment.Drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus (Review)Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

CochraneLibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0/uni00A0Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsThe included trials inadequately addressed the primary outcome measures of this review (percentage with complete resolution of skinlesions, percentage with clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions, and improvement in patient satisfaction/quality of life measures).One study of fluocinonide cream 0.05% (potent steroid) compared with hydrocortisone cream 1% (low-potency steroid) in 78 peoplereported complete resolution of skin lesions in 27% (10/37) of participants in the fluocinonide cream group and in 10% (4/41) in thehydrocortisone group, giving a 17% absolute benefit in favour of fluocinonide (risk ratio (RR) 2.77, 95% CI 0.95 to 8.08, 1 study, n = 78,low-quality evidence). The other primary outcome measures were not reported. Adverse events did not require discontinuation of the
drug. Skin irritation occurred in three people using hydrocortisone, and one person developed acne. Burning occurred in two people usingfluocinonide (moderate-quality evidence).A comparative trial of two oral agents, acitretin (50 mg daily) and hydroxychloroquine (400 mg daily), reported two of the outcomes ofinterest: complete resolution was seen in 13 of 28 participants (46%) on acitretin and 15 of 30 participants (50%) on hydoxychloroquine(RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.59, 1 study, n = 58, low-quality evidence). Clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions was reported in10 of 24 participants (42%) on acitretin and 17 of 25 (68%) on hydroxychloroquine (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.06, 1 study, n = 49, low-quality evidence). This comparison did not assess improvement in patient satisfaction/quality of life measures. Participants taking acitretin
showed a small increase in serum triglyceride, not suﬀicient to require withdrawal of the drug. The main adverse eﬀects were dry lips (93%of the acitretin group and 20% of the hydroxychloroquine group) and gastrointestinal disturbance (11% of the acitretin group and 17%of the hydroxychloroquine group). Four participants on acitretin withdrew due to gastrointestinal events or dry lips (moderate-qualityevidence).One trial randomised 10 people with DLE to apply a calcineurin inhibitor, pimecrolimus 1% cream, or a potent steroid, betamethasone 17-valerate 0.1% cream, for eight weeks. The study reported none of the primary outcome measures, nor did it present data on adverse events.A trial of calcineurin inhibitors compared tacrolimus cream 0.1% with placebo (vehicle) over 12 weeks in 14 people, but reported none ofour primary outcome measures. In the tacrolimus group, five participants complained of slight burning and itching, and for one participant,
a herpes simplex infection was reactivated (moderate-quality evidence).Topical R-salbutamol 0.5% cream was compared with placebo (vehicle) over eight weeks in one trial of 37 people with DLE. There was asignificant improvement in pain and itch in the salbutamol group at two, four, six, and eight weeks compared to placebo, but the trial didnot record a formal measure of quality of life. None of the primary outcome measures were reported. Changes in erythema did not showbenefit of salbutamol over placebo, but we could not obtain from the trial report the number of participants with clearing of erythemain at least 50% of lesions. There were 15 events in the placebo group (experienced by 12 participants) and 24 in the salbutamol group(experienced by nine participants). None of the adverse events were considered serious (moderate-quality evidence).Authors' conclusions
Authors' conclusionsFluocinonide cream may be more eﬀective than hydrocortisone in clearing DLE skin lesions. Hydroxychloroquine and acitretin appear to beof equal eﬀicacy in terms of complete resolution, although adverse eﬀects might be more frequent with acitretin, and clearing of erythema
of equal eﬀicacy in terms of complete resolution, although adverse eﬀects might be more frequent with acitretin, and clearing of erythemain at least 50% of lesions occurred less o/f_ten in participants applying acitretin. Moderate-quality evidence found adverse events were minoron the whole. There is not enough reliable evidence about other drugs used to treat DLE. Overall, the quality of the trials and levels ofuncertainty were such that there is a need for further trials of suﬀicient duration comparing, in particular, topical steroids with other agents.P L A I N /uni00A0 L A N G U A G E /uni00A0 S U M M A R YDrugs for discoid lupus erythematosusBackgroundDiscoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a form of skin inflammation which occurs particularly on sun-exposed skin and can cause scarring. Allforms of cutaneous lupus erythematosus are most common in women of childbearing age, which is important because some treatments,
including thalidomide and acitretin, can cause birth defects, and hydroxychloroquine may cause damage to the eye or ear. As the chronicnature and scarring of DLE can have psychological impact, and some treatments may produce serious adverse eﬀects, we felt it wasimportant to combat uncertainty and identify the best and safest treatment. The evidence is current to September 2016.Review questionWe aimed to identify the best treatment for people with DLE, to reduce the risk of scarring and possible psychological eﬀects. Wesearched for all possible drug treatments, including topical agents (steroids and pimecrolimus or tacrolimus) and oral agents, such ashydroxychloroquine, retinoids, methotrexate, azathioprine, lenalidomide, and biological agents. Potentially, any of these interventionscould have been compared with placebo or with any other intervention. We excluded surgery, laser, photoprotection, phototherapy, and
other forms of physical therapy as we did not consider them drug treatments. We hoped to find evidence for eﬀective treatment, withoutserious adverse eﬀects.Study characteristicsDrugs for discoid lupus erythematosus (Review)Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

CochraneLibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0/uni00A0Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsWe identified five studies, involving 197 people (aged between 17 and 82). Participants were recruited from Europe, Scandinavia, Iran, andthe United States. Most of the skin lesions were recorded on the face, ear, and scalp. The duration of disease ranged from one month to16 years. Treatments included steroid creams of diﬀerent potencies (fluocinonide and betamethasone cream, both potent steroids; andhydrocortisone, a low-potency steroid); oral hydroxychloroquine; oral acitretin; tacrolimus cream; pimecrolimus cream; and salbutamolcream. The tacrolimus and salbutamol trials used placebo in the control arm.Key resultsIn a trial involving 78 participants, fluocinonide cream 0.05% appeared nearly three times as eﬀective as hydrocortisone cream 1% in terms
of complete clearing of the DLE (27% versus 10%). The percentage of people who had a reduction in the redness of at least 50% of their soreswas not reported, nor was patient satisfaction. Skin irritation occurred in three people using hydrocortisone and one person developedacne; burning occurred in two people using fluocinonide. Adverse events did not stop any participants continuing to apply the creams.Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg and acitretin 50 mg appear to work equally well in terms of complete resolution (50% versus 46%,respectively). Marked improvement in redness may be less in the acitretin group (42% versus 68%), but neither drug has been comparedwith placebo. Patient satisfaction was not measured. Adverse events, more common in the acitretin group, were reported as minor,although four people stopped treatment due to dry lips and gastrointestinal symptoms.
Pimecrolimus cream 1% (an anti-inflammatory cream) was compared with betamethasone (steroid) 0.1% cream in a small 8-week studyinvolving 10 people, but none of the review primary outcomes were reported; nor were adverse eﬀects.A longer study using a similar type of cream, tacrolimus 0.1%, compared with placebo did not report the primary outcomes. Slight burningand itching was reported in five participants applying tacrolimus, and a herpes simplex infection came back in one participant. A few peoplereported burning or irritation a/f_ter the use of tacrolimus cream, but not suﬀicient to cause withdrawal.R-salbutamol 0.5% topical cream was compared with placebo cream in a trial of 37 people, but the primary outcomes of this review werenot reported. There were only minor adverse events reported in each group: 15 in the placebo group and 24 in the salbutamol group.Quality of the evidence
Quality of the evidenceFor our primary outcome of clearing or excellent improvement, we had low-quality evidence for fluocinonide 0.05% compared withhydrocortisone 1% as the only study assessing this comparison contained a high number of dropouts; while for acitretin (50 mg) comparedwith hydroxychloroquine (400 mg), for our primary outcomes of reduction in erythema and complete resolution we rated the quality ofevidence as low, as the study contained a small number of people and diﬀerences between the groups in the number of people who hadforms of lupus other than DLE. Overall, moderate-quality evidence was found for adverse events.Drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus (Review)Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.3

CochraneLibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0/uni00A0Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsB A C K G R O U N DDescription of the conditionDiscoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic and common formof cutaneous lupus — a form of skin inflammation of unknowncause. It occurs particularly on sun-exposed skin, such as the face,ears, and scalp, but occasionally is much more extensive, involvinglarge areas of skin. Some people with DLE have associated diseasein other parts of the body, but the majority of people with DLEare otherwise healthy. People with DLE are seen frequently in skinclinics throughout the world.There have been no accurate studies of the prevalence ofDLE, although all forms of lupus erythematosus are particularlycommon in women of childbearing age. The diagnosis of DLEis usually made easily on clinical grounds, characteristic clinicalfindings being erythema (redness), follicular plugging (blocked
and enlarged openings to hair follicles), pigmentary disturbances,telangiectasia (dilated capillaries), and atrophy (skin thinning).When the diagnosis is in doubt, a skin biopsy (microscopicexamination) may be required to confirm the diagnosis (Kuhn2014).In an attempt to improve consistency in the reporting of clinicaltrials, the CLASI (Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Area andSeverity Index) scoring system has been developed (Albrecht2005). The CLASI allows assessment of both active inflammation(erythema, scale, and hypertrophy) and damage (dyspigmentation,scarring, atrophy), in diﬀerent body areas, but does not include aquality of life score. It has not been tested in diﬀerent populations.Early eﬀective treatment may lead to total clearing of theskin lesions, but failure of treatment results in permanentscarring. The depressed scars, hair loss, and pigmentary changesare o/f_ten extremely disfiguring, particularly in darker-skinned
people. Permanent scarring is the rule if treatment is delayedor inadequate. Great emotional distress, social isolation, anddiﬀiculty obtaining work are problems frequently suﬀered by thesepatients. Involvement of the skin of the fingers and toes maymarkedly impair hand function and limit walking (Vasquez 2013). Inaddition, people with DLE are at risk of developing squamous cellcarcinoma in the scarred areas (Fernandes 2015).Description of the interventionThe anti-malarial drug chloroquine is the traditional therapy forDLE (Goldman 1953 ; Brodthagen 1959; Callen 1982 ). It is cheap andreadily available worldwide. Flare-ups of systemic lupus were notedto occur with increased frequency a/f_ter chloroquine was stopped(Rothfield 1963). However, some people cannot tolerate the drugand it is known to fail in others. Other anti-malarial agents havebeen used, sometimes in combination with chloroquine, but arenot widely available (Kierland 1953 ; Maguire 1962; Feldman 1994).
In recent years, hydroxychloroquine has been used in placeof chloroquine in many countries, because ocular side-eﬀectswere reported to be less frequent with hydroxychloroquine,but retinal toxicity has subsequently also been recognised withhydroxychloroquine (Geamanu 2014). The eﬀicacy of the two formsof the drug is thought to be the same, but no trials exist toconfirm this in DLE (Kreuter 2009). In discussing the treatment ofDLE in 1961, Prakken commented that: "This [lack of evidence]is illustrated by a survey of our literature on the treatmentof chronic lupus erythematosus. Although many papers agreeon their reports of favourable results, the value of our therapyremains doubtful because the influence of the placebo eﬀect andthe publications eﬀect has not been eliminated" (Prakken 1961).However, Rees felt that discoid lupus responded so dramaticallyto chloroquine that "double-blind studies are not required" (Rees
1963). In 1964, Kraak performed a literature search and concludedthat available information was insuﬀicient to evaluate the many
to chloroquine that "double-blind studies are not required" (Rees1963). In 1964, Kraak performed a literature search and concludedthat available information was insuﬀicient to evaluate the manytherapies that are recommended: "The literature leaves roomfor the alarming assumption that none of the drugs might doany good" (Kraak 1964). His group performed a non-randomiseddouble-blind trial comparing hydroxychloroquine with placebo(Kraak 1965). Spontaneous improvement or clearing occurred insome of their patients, particularly in the winter months (Kraak1965). The group on chloroquine showed a greater tendency toimprove (Kraak 1965). Other workers have been so concernedabout possible ocular side-eﬀects (thought to be very rare oncurrent low dosage regimens) that chloroquine was excluded fromtheir trial ( Mackey 1974). Smoking may reduce the eﬀicacy ofchloroquine in people with lupus: a recent review reports studiesthat demonstrate an inverse relationship between number of
cigarettes smoked and chloroquine blood levels (Chasset 2015).Unfortunately many of the other agents, reported anecdotally tobe of value in discoid lupus erythematosus, have considerablepotential side-eﬀects and some, such as thalidomide, may producemajor malformations in the foetus if taken during pregnancy(Cortés-Hernández 2012; Zhou 2013 ).Many other agents have been used to treat this condition (Callen1997). Sunscreens and sun avoidance reduce flares of cutaneouslupus, but are not usually suﬀicient alone (Kuhn 2011a). Otherpossible treatments include dapsone (Coburn 1982 ; Lindskov1986), topical and intralesional steroids (please note that theterm 'steroid' has been used in this review in place of the term'corticosteroid', although both terms have the same meaning)(Jansen 1965 ; Marsden 1968; Reyman 1974; Smith 1986 ), gold(Dalziel 1986 ), clofazimine (Mackey 1974), retinoids (Ruzicka1988; Shornick 1991 ), methotrexate (Goldstein 1994), azathioprine
(Tsokos 1985), lenalidomide ( Okon 2014), thalidomide ( Hasper1983; Knop 1983 ; Naafs 1985), topical salbutamol (Jemec 2009 ),sulphasalazine ( Artuz 1996 ), phenytoin (Rodriguez-Castellanos1995), interferon alpha-2a (Martinez 1992 ), topical calcineurinblockers (pimecrolimus and tacrolimus) (Wollina 2007 ; Tsellos2008), and biological agents such as abatacept (Merrill 2010a ),belimumab ( Manzi 2012 ), efalizumab (Usmani 2007), etanercept,infliximab, rituximab, sifalimumab (Merrill 2011 ) and sirukumab(Szepietowski 2013)How the intervention might workSteroids have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive eﬀects,acting on genetic material in the cell nucleus, via steroid receptorsin the cell (Norris 2005 ). Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, whichare calcineurin inhibitors, inhibit the activity of T lymphocytes(via calcium channels), a key cell in the development ofcutaneous lupus (Khandpur 2004 ). Salbutamol may exert an anti-
inflammatory eﬀect by activating receptors on the surface of cells,particularly lymphocytes and eosinophils (Jemec 2009 ). Evidencesuggests that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine which areantimalarials, have an eﬀect on inflammation by reducing antigenpresentation and the production of inflammatory cytokines(Rainsford 2015).

CochraneLibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0/uni00A0Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviewsretinoids, such as acitretin, are not fully understood. Retinoidreceptors allow access to the cell nucleus, and retinoids promotenormal cell growth (Schroeder 2007).Why it is important to do this reviewPermanent scarring is likely if treatment is delayed or inadequate.People with DLE o/f_ten experience great emotional distress. Socialisolation and diﬀiculty obtaining work are frequent problems. Therelative eﬀicacies of possible forms of treatment compared toplacebo or each other need to be clearly established. Some ofthese agents (such as the cytotoxics) are potentially toxic (Weinblatt2013; Goldberg 2015). Both thalidomide and the retinoids are highlyteratogenic (they may cause birth defects when given to pregnantwomen), which renders their use in fertile women problematic(Ortiz 2013 ; Zhou 2013 ). It is this combination of uncertainty of
relative eﬀectiveness and some potential to cause considerableharm that has fuelled the need for this systematic review. This is anupdate of a Cochrane Review first published in 2000 (Jessop 2000 );and previously updated in 2009 (Jessop 2009 ).O B J E C T I V E STo assess the eﬀects of drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus.M E T H O D SCriteria for considering studies for this reviewTypes of studiesRandomised controlled trials of drug therapy for discoid lupuserythematosus.Types of participantsParticipants at least 18 years of age.A clinical diagnosis of discoid lupus erythematosus was accepted,with or without histological confirmation. Studies that enrolledpeople with diﬀerent types of cutaneous lupus were included if thesubgroup with DLE could be identified separately.Types of interventionsAny drug treatment aimed at clearing or improving the lesions ofDLE. This included:•chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and other anti-malarialquinines;

references to relevant trials.CorrespondenceWe approached seven experts in the field of DLE treatment in anattempt to identify other relevant studies, including unpublishedtrials and dissertations. We asked three pharmaceutical companiesfor records of unpublished trials.We approached authors of registered but unpublished trialsrequesting their results.Adverse eﬀectsWe did not perform a separate search for adverse eﬀects ofthe target intervention. However, we recorded all adverse eventsin Characteristics of included studies and and Characteristics ofexcluded studies.Data collection and analysisSJ and DW, with PJ's assistance, extracted the data independentlyand resolved diﬀerences by discussion.MG examined and described the statistical information in individualtrials and edited or wrote the sections on measures of treatmenteﬀect, data synthesis and unit of analysis issues and created the'Summary of findings' tables.Selection of studies
Selection of studiesWe (SJ, DW, PJ) screened the titles and abstracts andindependently selected them for inclusion or exclusion. Weresolved disagreements by discussion.Data extraction and managementWe (SJ, DW) extracted trial characteristics and outcomes,independently, and recorded the data on a data extraction sheet.We resolved disagreements by discussion.Assessment of risk of bias in included studiesWe (SJ, DW, MG) assessed the risk of bias and the methodologicalquality of included studies independently, using the followingcomponents of internal and external validity for each includedstudy, as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviewsof Interventions (Higgins 2011 ).a) The method of generation of the randomisation sequence.b) The method of allocation concealment.c) Who was blinded and not blinded.d) The number of participants lost to follow-up and the reasonsprovided for these losses.e) Whether outcomes were analysed according to the intention-to-
treat principle.f) Comparability of the two treatment groups in each arm.MG checked assessments in case of discrepancy.Measures of treatment eﬀectFor dichotomous outcomes (primary outcomes 1 and 2 andadverse events), results are presented as risk ratios (RR) with95% confidence intervals (CI). Where the first treatment inthe comparison is beneficial (RR > 1 for eﬀicacy outcomes),we presented the number needed to treat for an additionalbeneficial outcome (NNTB) for any significant outcomes (P <0.05). We planned to present the number needed to treat for anadditional harmful outcome (NNTH) where the first treatment inthe comparison is harmful (RR > 1 for safety outcomes) for anysignificant adverse outcomes (P < 0.05).Where results were estimated for individual studies with lownumbers of outcomes (< 10 in total) or where the total sample sizewere less than 30 participants, we planned to report the proportionof outcomes in each treatment group, together with a P value from
a Fisher’s Exact test (obtained using the "tabi" calculator in Stata
of outcomes in each treatment group, together with a P value froma Fisher’s Exact test (obtained using the "tabi" calculator in Stataversion 14).For continuous outcomes (primary outcome 3), we planned topresent results in the form of mean diﬀerences (with 95% CIs).Where there were treatment comparisons where studies useddiﬀerent scales for the same outcome, we planned to convertresults to standard mean diﬀerences (SMD) to allow pooling ofresults.Unit of analysis issuesCross-over trialsWe followed the guidance provided in Section 16.4.4 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins2011). Where no evidence of a carry-over eﬀect was present,analyses of paired diﬀerences were presented if these data could beobtained from the trial report. Otherwise, only data from the firsttreatment period were used.Drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus (Review)Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.12
CochraneLibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0/uni00A0Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsWithin-patient studiesInternally controlled trials were analysed using techniquesfor paired designs (e.g. paired t-test, McNemar's test). Whereappropriate, these were included in additional data tables and notpooled with parallel group trials.Dealing with missing dataThe use of 'intention-to-treat' analysis was reported in the 'Risk ofbias' tables of the 'Characteristics of included studies' tables. SJwrote to five authors and received a response from three authors;some of the investigators in trial registries did not supply contactdetails.Assessment of heterogeneityWe planned to test statistical heterogeneity using the I/two.supsstatistic (0% to 40%: may not be important; 30% to 60%:may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90%: mayrepresent substantial heterogeneity; 75% to 100%: represents
considerable heterogeneity) (Higgins 2011 ), However, assessmentof heterogeneity was not performed as no findings were based onpooled results from two or more trials. If in future updates meta-analyses are performed, the heterogeneity will be quantified usingthe I/two.sups statistic. In cases of substantial heterogeneity (I/two.sups > 80%),studies will not be pooled and instead reasons for heterogeneitywill be explored.Assessment of reporting biasesAssessment for reporting bias was not possible in the presentreview as this contained no pooled results from meta-analyses.If in future updates of this review there are 10 studies or moreof any single intervention, funnel plots will be used to evaluateasymmetry, using Egger's method (Egger 1997), as described insection 10.4.3.1 of theCochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviewsof Interventions (Higgins 2011 ). A degree of reporting bias wasidentified in Jemec 2009 , with details of erythema not reported,
although this was described as part of the outcome score.Diﬀerence in erythema was not statistically significant.Data synthesisWe planned to draw up a synthesis of included trials; however, thiswas not possible with the data in the studies we found, due toheterogeneity of study methods and interventions. No two trialsinvestigated the same interventions. If in future updates of thereview it is possible to pool results then we will use random eﬀectsmeta-analysis for both dichotomous and continuous outcomes toaccount for the anticipated heterogeneity between studies.Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneityIn the protocol, we had planned to perform subgroup analysison the following measures: disseminated DLE versus localisedDLE; DLE with systemic lupus versus DLE without systemic lupus;histologically proven versus clinically diagnosed DLE; and eﬀectof ethnic group on outcome. However subgroup analysis was notpossible in this update.Other
possible in this update.OtherWe planned where possible to calculate cost eﬀectiveness ratiosusing quality-of-life measures; however, the studies identified didnot provide these data.Sensitivity analysisSensitivity analyses were not carried out as no findings from thisreview were based on pooled results from two or more studies.If in future updates of this review pooled results are presented,sensitivity analyses will be carried out restricting results to studiesassessed as being at low risk of bias for all of the following threedomains: allocation concealment; blinding of participants andoutcomes assessors; and incomplete outcome data (Higgins 2011 ).'Summary of findings' table'Summary of findings' tables as detailed in the Cochrane Handbookfor Systematic Reviews of Interventions were produced from withinReview Manager 5 (RevMan 5) so/f_tware (Higgins 2011 ).

Confidence intervals for thecorresponding risk were calculated using GRADEpro 2008 so/f_tware.R E S U L T SDescription of studiesResults of the searchWe retrieved 71 records from the searches for the 2009 review(Jessop 2009 ), of which two met the criteria for inclusion (Roenigk1980 and Ruzicka 1992). Literature searches in 2014, 2015, and2016 yielded a further 155 studies. We identified 12 studies fromour searches of trials registers. In total we screened 238 records.We excluded 202 records on the basis of titles and abstracts.Of the remaining 36 records, one article was not available infull text and has been added to studies awaiting classification(Pothinamthong 2012) along with eight trials registry records (see
Characteristics of studies awaiting classification). One study isongoing (see Characteristics of ongoing studies). The remaining 26articles were assessed in full text for eligibility.Of the 26 full texts, we excluded 23 studies (14 did not describeoutcomes in the DLE group specifically and others were excludedbecause they referred to photoprotection trials and not drug trialsor were not RCTs) (see Characteristics of excluded studies). Weincluded three new studies in this update (Barikbin 2009 , Jemec2009, and Kuhn 2011), giving a total of five included studiesaltogether (see Characteristics of included studies). We noted thatdiagnosis of DLE was generally based on clinical judgement in theearly studies, but investigators required histological (skin biopsy)confirmation in the three new studies.Of the nine drug trials of DLE listed in Characteristics of studiesawaiting classification, the interventions included etanercept,
other biologics, R-salbutamol, pimecrolimus, and an oral retinoid,alitretinoin. Half of the studies were described as complete butresults have not yet been published. We attempted to contact twoof the investigators, without success. One investigator reportedthat their study did not include analysis of the subset with DLE.For a summary of our screening process see Figure 1.Drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus (Review)Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The full detailsare in the Characteristics of included studies table. There were atotal of 197 participants (see sample sizes).DesignThe first study, involving 78 people, was a double-blind RCTcomparing two steroid creams of diﬀerent potencies (Roenigk1980). The creams were prepared in the same cream base andidentical tubes, and were compared in a 12-week cross-over trial. Asingle active lesion on each person was chosen for monitoring. Oneof the creams was applied for 6 weeks, then the other for a further6 weeks. Only the outcome prior to cross-over was included in theanalysis for this review.The second trial was a double-blind RCT, over 8 weeks (Ruzicka1992).The third trial, was a double-blind RCT, over 8 weeks (Barikbin
2009).In Jemec 2009 , an active agent was compared with placebo, in adouble-blind RCT. The creams were identical.A 2011 trial was a double-blind placebo-controlled RCT, over 12weeks (Kuhn 2011). The vehicle was used as the placebo, to ensureblinding.Sample sizesThere were a total of 197 participants in the five trials: 78 in Roenigk1980; 58 in Ruzicka 1992; 10 in Barikbin 2009;  37 in Jemec 2009 ; and14 in the study by Kuhn 2011.Drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus (Review)Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

CochraneLibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0/uni00A0Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsSettingThe setting of Roenigk 1980 was not stated. Ruzicka 1992, Barikbin2009, Jemec 2009  and Kuhn 2011 were set in specialised lupusclinics, as most people with DLE were attending such clinics.ParticipantsRoenigk 1980 randomised for inclusion 32 men and 61 women,aged 17 to 82 years, from the following ethnic groups: 23 blackAmerican, and 25 white American in one group; and 23 blackAmerican, and 22 white American in the other. The duration oftheir disease was very variable (1 to 240 months). There were nosignificant diﬀerences between people in the two arms, in terms ofdemographics or duration of disease. All participants had chronicDLE. However final number of participants was 78, (others excludedat onset) and ethnic and gender breakdown of participating groupwas not supplied.In Ruzicka 1992, there were 22 men and 36 women, with a
mean age of 43.3 years. The ethnic group was not mentioned.All participants had cutaneous lupus, 39 discoid and 19 subacuteLE. People with subacute LE were more highly represented in thehydroxychloroquine arm.In Barikbin 2009  , participants were Iranian, aged 20 to 53, and 7 ofthe 10 were women. Participants in Jemec 2009  included 28 womenand 9 men, aged 34 to 72. There was no ethnicity provided. In theKuhn 2011 trial, there were six women and eight men with DLE, witha mean age of 49.8 ± 5.9. Ethnicity was not supplied.InterventionsRoenigk 1980 compared two topical steroids, fluocinonide 0.05%(potent steroid) and hydrocortisone 1% (mild steroid) in the samecream base.Ruzicka 1992 compared two oral agents, acitretin (a syntheticretinoid) and hydroxychloroquine (an anti-malarial).Barikbin 2009  compared pimecrolimus 1% cream withbetamethasone 17-valerate 0.1% cream.Jemec 2009  compared salbutamol 0.5% cream with placebo (samevehicle, so indistinguishable).
vehicle, so indistinguishable).Kuhn 2011 compared tacrolimus 0.1% cream with placebo(vehicle).OutcomesIn Roenigk 1980, the outcome was based on the authors' own 5-point scale, using a single test site. The investigators used a scale,providing a score of 1 if the lesion became worse, 2 if there was noimprovement, 3 if there was a little improvement, 4 if improvementwas marked, and 5 if the lesion cleared or showed excellentimprovement. There was no assessment by the participants.Assessment of severity in Ruzicka 1992 was based on an ordinalscale using erythema (redness), infiltration (thickness), and scalingwith complete clearing graded as 0, improvement as 1, and nochange or deterioration as 2. Extent of skin disease and theoccurrence of adverse reactions were also documented.Barikbin 2009  used digital photographs, which were examined bythree blinded dermatologists, using a severity score.Jemec 2009  reported outcomes using the CLASI score, the
clinician's global assessment and the participant's globalassessment.Kuhn 2011 used digital photography and a clinical assessment,using a clinical score. They reported adverse events.Quality-of-life measures or participant global evaluation were notrecorded in any of the studies.Excluded studiesDetails of the 23 excluded studies can be found in theCharacteristics of excluded studies table. In 14 studies, participantshad systemic or cutaneous lupus, or both, but the groupwith DLE were not described specifically, so the influence oftreatment in DLE could not be established. Seven trials werenot randomised. Authors of two excluded RCTs reported resultswith topical tacrolimus versus topical clobetasol propionate, andclofazimine versus chloroquine diphosphate (Bezerra 2005; Tzung2007). However, in both studies participants had various formsof cutaneous lupus and results for individual subsets were notreported separately, thus it was not possible to establish the
relative benefits of individual treatments in DLE. Avgerinou 2012
of cutaneous lupus and results for individual subsets were notreported separately, thus it was not possible to establish therelative benefits of individual treatments in DLE. Avgerinou 2012was not an RCT and the DLE subset was not reported. Gammon 2011did not report results for the DLE subset. Manzi 2012 , Merrill 2010a ,Merrill 2010b , Merrill 2011  and Szepietowski 2013 described peoplewith SLE and did not provide data for the DLE subset. The study ofmucosal DLE, comparing tacrolimus ointment and triamcinolonecream by Wang 2015 had major methodology flaws: participantswere not blinded and the basis for diagnosis of DLE was not clear(Wang 2015).We found 12 registered trials in the trial registries. We attempted tocontact investigators where the trial was described as completedand had not been published, but very few trial records providedrelevant contact details. We received two replies, confirming thatpeople with DLE had not been recorded separately in their trials.
Risk of bias in included studiesOverall, risk of bias was considered low or unclear for mostparameters for the included studies.See Figure 2 for the risk of bias summary of the judgements for eachincluded study./uni00A0Drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus (Review)Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

In Ruzicka 1992, comparing hydroxychloroquine andacitretin, participants were randomised but methods taken toconceal the allocation were not stated.In Barikbin 2009 , randomisation was applied by the use of oddand even numbers, (quasi-randomisation), hence was consideredhigh risk of selection bias from an inadequate random sequencegeneration. However, the method used would not introduceselection bias from allocation concealment as numbers wereassigned on the basis of order of referral, so decisions made (re:
participation) could not have been made with knowledge of thetreatment to be received.In Jemec 2009 , randomisation was generated from a randomnumber list. However, details as to whether the randomisationlist was available to recruiting clinicians was not stated (unclearallocation concealment).In Kuhn 2011, random numbers were computer generated andallocation was conducted by a pharmacist who was independent ofthe study investigators (adequate concealment of allocation).Drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus (Review)Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Ruzicka 1992 was described asdouble-blind, but no details were provided.Blinding was described in Barikbin 2009 , with identical jars of testagents. In Jemec 2009 , blinding was described for both assessorsand participants. The Kuhn 2011 study similarly used identicalcontainers and both participants and assessors were blinded.Incomplete outcome dataIn the Roenigk 1980 study, data from 78 people were available foranalysis at the end of the first phase (six weeks). Fi/f_teen peopledropped out during the first phase, 13 because of non-compliance,and two because of the use of a proscribed drug. Hence, the studywas judged at high risk of attrition bias.
was judged at high risk of attrition bias.The remaining studies were at low risk of attrition bias. In Ruzicka1992, 51 of 58 participants completed the trial (83%). Among thosegiven acitretin, four people dropped-out because of side-eﬀects(not detailed), another because of treatment failure, and a sixth dueto non-compliance. In the hydroxychloroquine group three peoplewithdrew from the study prematurely because of complete clearingof skin lesions and one because of failure of treatment. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.There were no withdrawals from the Barikbin 2009  trial.In the Jemec 2009  study, the numbers contributing to the analyseswere not stated but it was clearly stated that an intention-to-treatanalysis was carried out.In the Kuhn 2011 trial, two of the 14 participants with DLE didnot complete the trial. Intention to treat analysis was used in asecondary analysis.Overall, ITT analysis was described in three studies: Barikbin 2009 ,
Jemec 2009 , and Kuhn 2011. It was not reported in the other twostudies and this was a clear potential risk of bias in the Roenigk 1980trial, as 15 participants were excluded from final analysis.Selective reportingOne study was considered to be at high risk of selective reportingbecause they authors did not provide details on the impact onerythema (Jemec 2009 ). In two studies it was unclear if there wasselective reporting (Kuhn 2011, Roenigk 1980), while the remainingtwo studies were judged as low risk (Barikbin 2009,  Roenigk 1980),as all expected outcomes were reported.Other potential sources of biasOverall, it was unclear whether studies were at risk of otherpotential sources of bias, except for Ruzicka 1992 where highclinical heterogeneity was identified; hence, was judged as highrisk of other bias. Studies were also assessed separately for'Comparability of the two arms', see below.Comparability of the two arms
Comparability of the two armsThe risk of bias was rated as low in four studies. In the Roenigk 1980trial, the groups were comparable at baseline. The participants inthe two arms in the Jemec 2009  study had similar active lesions atbaseline (activity scores 1.32 ± 0.48 vs 1.11 ± 0.47). The mean diseaseseverity score was similar between the two groups at baseline inthe Barikbin 2009  study. Kuhn 2011 also had comparable arms atbaseline.Ruzicka 1992 included 19 people with subacute cutaneous lupuserythematosus. As people with this form of cutaneous lupus weremore strongly represented in the chloroquine group, this mighthave influenced the outcome of treatment, as people with subacutelupus may have a better response rate. The response rates fordiscoid lupus and subacute lupus were not described separately.Hence, this study was judged to be at high risk of bias.We are of the opinion that none of the five studies included in this

At the 6-week cross-over point,clearing or excellent improvement was found in 10 out of 37 people(27%) using fluocinonide and in four out of 41 people (10%) usinghydrocortisone (RR 2.77, 95% CI 0.95 to 8.08), 1 study, n = 78, low-
quality evidence) (Analysis 1.1 ). This shows an absolute benefit ofpotent steroid of 17% (95% CI 0 to 34%). The quality of evidence forthis outcome was judged to be low.Drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus (Review)Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.17
CochraneLibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0/uni00A0Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsIn the Ruzicka 1992 study, the overall outcome appeared similarin the hydroxychloroquine 400 mg and acitretin 50 mg groups(Summary of findings 2). There was marked improvement orcomplete clearing in 13 out of 28 (46%) participants given acitretinand in 15 out of 30 (50%) of those on hydroxychloroquine; i.e. therewas no significant diﬀerence between the two groups (RR 0.93,95% CI 0.54 to 1.59) (Analysis 2.1 ).The quality of evidence for thisoutcome was judged to be low.In the Barikbin 2009  study, those treated with pimecrolimus 1%had an 86% reduction in severity score compared to 73% inthe betamethasone 17-valerate 0.1% cream group (P = 0.1). Thenumber of participants with complete resolution could not beobtained from the paper (Summary of findings 3).In the study by Jemec 2009 , the number of participants with
complete resolution could not be obtained from the paper(Summary of findings 4).In the Kuhn 2011 study looking at tacrolimus 0.1% cream versusplacebo (vehicle), no participants with DLE were reported as havingexperienced complete clearing (Summary of findings 5). The qualityof evidence for this outcome was judged to be low.Percentage of people with clearing of erythema in at least 50%of lesions (postinflammatory pigmentation could persist)In none of the studies was there a measurement of the percentageof participants with clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions.Roenigk 1980 used a score that included erythema to measureoutcome, but did not report the erythema separately. In the Ruzicka1992 study the eﬀect on erythema was assessed using an ordinalscale where complete clearing was graded as 0 and improvementas 1, so we take this to mean there was clearing of erythema in atleast 50% of lesions. Erythema showed more marked improvement
in the hydroxychloroquine 400 mg group and more people inthis group showed complete clearing compared to those takingacitretin 50 mg, although the result was not statistically significant.There was complete clearing or marked improvement of erythemain 10/24 (42%) of participants in the acitretin group compared to17/25 (68%) in the hydroxychloroquine group (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.36to 1.06) (Analysis 2.2 .) The quality of evidence for this outcome wasjudged to be low.While Barikbin 2009  recorded erythema in treated sites as partof the clinical score, results for erythema were not reportedseparately.In the Jemec 2009  study, there was no significant improvement inerythema, but the actual data were not provided.In the Kuhn 2011 study, erythema was included in the clinical score,but actual data were not provided.Improvement in participant satisfaction/quality of life measuresThere was no record of any measurements of participant
satisfaction or quality of life in any of the included studies.Jemec 2009  and Kuhn 2011 recorded itch and pain as reported byparticipants, but no global score or assessment of quality of life.Secondary outcomes•Relapse rate when medication stopped or reduced.•Prevention of new lesions.•Adverse eﬀects of medication, leading to discontinuation orsignificant morbidity.•Implications for health care costs.Relapse rate when medication stopped or reducedThere was no explicit record of relapse rates when medication wasstopped in three of the studies. Barikbin 2009  reported that therewas no relapse at eight weeks, a/f_ter stopping the trial medicationat four weeks. The trial of Kuhn 2011 reported improvement inskin lesions at four and eight weeks but the benefit was notmaintained at 12 weeks. Thus the skin condition had relapsed whilethe participants were still using the trial cream, tacrolimus 0.1%.Prevention of new lesions
Prevention of new lesionsIn none of the studies was this outcome directly measured.Adverse eﬀects of medication, leading to discontinuation orsignificant morbidity
Prevention of new lesionsIn none of the studies was this outcome directly measured.Adverse eﬀects of medication, leading to discontinuation orsignificant morbidityIn the Roenigk 1980 study, adverse eﬀects were minor and wereseen in both groups (moderate-quality evidence). Skin irritationoccurred in three people using hydrocortisone cream 1% andburning occurred in two people using fluocinonide cream 0.05%.One person in the hydrocortisone group developed acne. The trialwas too short to assess other side-eﬀects, such as skin atrophy(thinning) or capillary damage.In the Ruzicka 1992 study, compared with those takinghydroxychloroquine 400 mg adverse eﬀects were more frequentin the acitretin group 50 mg and were more severe, with fourparticipants having to discontinue treatment because of adverseeﬀects (moderate-quality evidence). The main clinical adverseeﬀects were dry lips/cheilitis (93% of the acitretin and 20% of the
hydroxychloroquine group) and gastrointestinal disturbance (11%of the acitretin and 17% of the hydroxychloroquine group, but nospecific information was provided). Laboratory studies revealedchanges in triglycerides in both groups, the levels rising from amean of 1.66 to 2.10 mmol/l in the acitretin group (P = 0.01) andfalling from 1.94 to 1.50 mmol/l in the hydroxychloroquine group(P = 0.02). The diﬀerence between the two groups was highlysignificant (P = 0.006).In the Barikbin 2009  study, adverse events were not reported.In the Jemec 2009  trial there were 39 reported adverse events, 15in the placebo group and 24 in the salbutamol 0.5% topical creamgroup (moderate-quality evidence). None of the adverse eventswere considered serious and the adverse events did not appear tobe related to the trial medication.Kuhn 2011 reported that five people experienced itching or burningat the site of tacrolimus 0.1% cream application, sometimes lasting
up to six weeks, and one participant developed herpes simplexinfection of the lip during treatment (moderate-quality evidence).There were no serious adverse events. No adverse events wereexperienced by the participants using the placebo cream.Implications for healthcare costsThere was no measurement of this outcome in any of the studies.Drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus (Review)Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

CochraneLibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0/uni00A0Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsD I S C U S S I O NSummary of main resultsFive trials are reported in this version of the review, with a totalof 197 participants. Three of the studies are new to this update(Barikbin 2009 ; Jemec 2009 ; Kuhn 2016). Two of the trials includedsmall numbers of participants (10 in Barikbin 2009  and 14 in Kuhn2011).Interventions in the five trials were topical steroids,hydroxychloroquine, acitretin, topical salbutamol, topicaltacrolimus, and topical pimecrolimus.The study of topical steroids provides some evidence that apotent steroid cream, fluocinonide 0.05%, may be superior to low-potency hydrocortisone 1% in the complete resolution of discoidlupus erythematosus skin lesions (Summary of findings for themain comparison) (Roenigk 1980). The ideal duration of treatmentor likelihood of recurrences following treatment has not been
established. Our second primary outcome (percentage of peoplewith clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions) was notmeasured.In the comparative trial of hydroxychloroquine 400 mg and acitretin50 mg (Ruzicka 1992), no diﬀerence in eﬀicacy was demonstratedbetween the two drugs in terms of the primary outcome, withcomplete resolution of skin lesions reported in 46% of peopletaking acitretin and in 50% of those on hydroxychloroquine.Regarding the second primary outcome, 42% of participants takingacitretin showed improvement in erythema in at least 50% oflesions compared with 68% of the hydroxychloroquine group(Summary of findings 2).The two studies of calcineurin inhibitors (pimecrolimus 1% andtacrolimus 0.1%) (Barikbin 2009 ; Kuhn 2011), and the study ofR-salbutamol 0.5% topical cream (Jemec 2009 ), unfortunatelyincluded only 61 participants in all and did not report the primaryoutcomes of the review (Summary of findings 3; Summary of
findings 4 ; Summary of findings 5).There is some evidence that the trial drugs were free of serious side-eﬀects, but the short duration of most of the trials does not allowany conclusion about long-term adverse eﬀects of topical steroids.Adverse events were reported in the 12-week tacrolimus 0.1%study, which was compared to placebo (Kuhn 2011), but none wereserious. Roenigk 1980 (fluocinonide cream 0.05% vs hydrocortisonecream 1%) was short (six weeks in each arm), and thus side-eﬀectsof long-term topical steroid use could not be assessed. Ruzicka 1992(acitretin 50 mg vs hydroxychloroquine 400 mg) was the only studythat reported discontinuation of participants due to adverse events(four people receiving acitretin discontinued treatment due to drylips and gastrointestinal symptoms). Jemec 2009  compared topicalsalbutamol 0.5% cream with placebo (vehicle), and both groupsreported minor adverse events but no serious adverse events.
Barikbin 2009  did not present data on adverse events.We are uncertain about the eﬀect of the interventions on patientsatisfaction/quality of life, as this primary outcome was notmeasured by any of our included studies. The secondary outcomesof preventing new lesions and implications for healthcare costswere not assessed in any study either. Relapse rate whenmedication was stopped or reduced was reported in Barikbin 2009and Kuhn 2011. There was no relapse reported in Barikbin 2009at eight weeks, a/f_ter stopping the trial medication at four weeks;whilst in Kuhn 2011, participants relapsed by 12 weeks.Overall completeness and applicability of evidenceThe studies in this review have not addressed all the objectives ofthe review and do not identify the most eﬀective treatment for DLEin all types of participants.The studies identified in this review did not address (or addressedinadequately) the relative benefits of many currently used

Outcome measures failed to address qualityof life measures or, in most cases, relapse rate a/f_ter medicationwas stopped. Most studies did not report on complete resolutionof skin lesions or clearing of erythema either. Although diﬀerentpopulations participated in the trials, there were no trials from Asia,Africa, Australia or South America.Quality of the evidenceFive trials, involving 197 participants were included. Some primaryoutcome measures in this review (per cent with completeresolution, percentage with at least 50% improvement in erythema)were inadequately addressed in the majority of included trials.Furthermore, quality of life was not assessed in any of the fiveincluded studies.
included studies.Where quantitative results were provided for primary outcomes,the overall quality of the evidence was judged to be low owing to thesmall size of most of the studies and high risk of bias on importantdomains such as incomplete outcome data and non-comparabilityof treatment arms at baseline.All trials were judged to be at low risk of bias for blindingas they were all double-blind and interventions were identicalin appearance (although for two studies, Roenigk 1980 andRuzicka 1992, the methods used to ensure blinding were notfully described). In four studies the method used to generate theallocation sequence was adequate; however, one study was aquasi-randomised trial where patients were numbered based ontime of referral and odd numbered participants were allocated toone treatment and even numbered patients to the other. However,as this study did not include any of our pre-specified primary orsecondary outcome measures (instead a total mean severity score
was calculated before and a/f_ter treatment for each participant), nodata for this study were presented in our 'Summary of findings'tables. The method used to conceal allocation was also unclearin three of the studies (Jemec 2009 , Roenigk 1980; Ruzicka 1992);however, this was judged to be adequate for the other two studies(Barikbin 2009 ; Kuhn 2011), For four studies, either the numbersanalysed were the same as the number recruited or the numberof dropouts was very small, so these were judged to be at low riskof bias for incomplete outcome data. However in the Roenigk 1980study, 15 of the 78 participants did not contribute data towards theprimary outcome of clearing or excellent improvement for reasonswhich may relate to outcome (Summary of findings for the maincomparison). Therefore, the quality of evidence on whether thereis a diﬀerence between fluocinonide and hydrocortisone (low-potency steroid) with respect to clearing or excellent improvement

CochraneLibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0/uni00A0Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviewswas downgraded by one level. In the trial by Ruzicka 1992, therewere more participants with DLE in the hydroxychloroquine group.This created unbalanced treatment groups, which could haveinfluenced the outcomes of clearing or excellent improvement andmore than 50% reduction in erythema (Summary of findings 2). Weidentified no other potential sources of bias that might have hada direct eﬀect on any risk measures presented, However, in manyinstances our ability to assess these was unclear.Sample size was judged to be inadequate in all of the includedstudies, except in the case of Roenigk 1980 with 78 participants(others ranged from 10 to 58 participants per study). This resultedin imprecise measures of eﬀect in instances where these werepresented, and evidence was therefore downgraded accordingly in
instances where assessment of the quality of evidence is provided(Summary of findings for the main comparison; Summary offindings 2 ). The small numbers in Ruzicka 1992 may weaken thevalidity of this study, as does the lack of a control arm, as neitherintervention is of established eﬀicacy (Summary of findings 2). Theinclusion of people with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosusis an even greater source of possible error and the results requireconfirmation.We also assessed the quality of evidence for adverse events leadingto discontinuation or significant morbidity in four out of fivecomparisons in the 'Summary of findings' tables. The quality ofevidence was moderate, with downgrading for imprecision in allcomparisons because the evidence was based on only one studywith a small number of participants. Furthermore, only Ruzicka1992 reported participants discontinuing, while the remainingstudies only reported minor adverse events. The overall sample size
may not have been large enough to identify serious adverse events.All of the comparisons included in this review were assessed insingle studies, which did not allow us to assess consistency ofresults across studies. As such it was not possible in our review toassess what factors could potentially contribute to diﬀerences infindings between studies (heterogeneity).Indirectness cannot be assessed with confidence in the includedstudies. As the studies were performed in specialist clinics and mostpeople with DLE are likely to be treated initially at that level, thesetting is not out of line with clinical practice.Potential biases in the review processWe attempted to conduct a comprehensive search for studies, butthe fact that one study has not yet been incorporated may be asource of potential bias (Pothinamthong 2012). Studies in whichparticipants had SLE or undefined cutaneous LE were excludedfrom the review, but two studies that included participants with
DLE and SCLE, ( Ruzicka 1992 and Kuhn 2011), were included andthis may have introduced a bias. There were 12 studies identified intrials registries, but unpublished and most without contact details.The reviewers were unable to establish the outcome of these trials.A/f_ter the publication of the original protocol and review (Jessop2000), a scoring measure was published, and has been widely usedfor reporting outcomes in DLE (Albrecht 2005). One included study(Jemec 2009 ) reported outcomes using this scoring measure, butthe data were not included in our systematic review because thistype of outcome measure was not specified in the review protocol.Agreements and disagreements with other studies orreviewsWe are not aware of any other relevant reviews or studies.A U T H O R S ' /uni00A0 C O N C L U S I O N SImplications for practice1.There is currently insuﬀicient evidence to guide clinicians in thetreatment of severe DLE.

treatment of severe DLE.2.Potent steroid cream (fluocinonide) appears to be moreeﬀective than low-potency steroid cream (hydrocortisone) inthe treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus, although thepotent steroid was eﬀective in only about a quarter of the peopletreated and the low-potency steroid in about 10%.3.Both hydroxychloroquine and acitretin are associated withmarked improvement or clearing in about half of all peopletreated, but neither drug has been tested against placebo in arandomised clinical trial.4.At present there is no reliable evidence to support the useof other specific treatments for discoid lupus erythematosus.This should not be seen as evidence that current treatment isineﬀective but rather that evidence of eﬀectiveness is lacking.Notably, there have been several large multicentre trials ofnewer biological agents (Manzi 2012 , Merrill 2010a , Merrill 2011 ,Merrill 2010b , Szepietowski 2013), but unfortunately cutaneous
subsets have not been reported separately, so we cannot reachany conclusion about possible benefits of biological agents inDLE. Trials investigating the use of topical biological agentshave been registered but no data from such trials is available atpresent.5.The study in ‘Studies awaiting classification’ may alter theconclusions of the review once assessed.Implications for researchA combination of small numbers, diﬀerent outcome measures andshort duration reduce the strength of most of these trials and theresults need to be confirmed in larger trials.The early single lesion of DLE may respond well to potent steroidcreams. One of the goals should be to prevent scarring as, once itoccurs, it is largely irreversible.Well-planned randomised controlled trials are needed to providea guide to the treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus. Trialsshould not mix diﬀerent types of lupus together and ideallythe diagnosis should be confirmed with a skin biopsy. There is
a need for trials comparing topical steroids with other agents.The outcome measures should be stated clearly and shouldinclude participants' views and information about scarring. If theCLASI scoring system is adopted widely, more consistent outcomemeasures may be obtained. If future trials were to include a coreset of outcome measures, following the recent COUSIN initiativefrom the Cochrane Skin Group, there is a much greater likelihood ofbeing able to pool results from multiple studies in future updatesof this review.Also, the trials should be of suﬀicient duration to allow forseasonal variation and capture of relapses (suggested minimum of9 months).

In this update, we havetried to rectify this, in line with the current Cochrane Handbook and RevMan so/f_tware.Background: this section has been updated.
Background: this section has been updated.Objectives: the sentence 'To identify the need for further study to make rational clinical decisions possible when treating cutaneous lupus'was omitted from this update in line with current Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and RevMan 5 so/f_tware andthe previously published versions of the review as it was considered redundant.Types of interventions: we planned to include other anti-malarial quinines other than chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, but didnot find any RCTs for these interventions. Although not planned in the protocol, in this update we did additionally include lenalidomide,biological agents, (including abatacept, adalimumab, belimumab, etanercept, efalizumab, infliximab, rituximab, sifalimumab andsirukumab), topical calcineurin antagonists, (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) and topical salbutamol as these agents had become available
and trials had been performed in connective tissue disorders. We also clarified the types of comparators we would accept, as this detailwas not specified in the protocol. We expanded the list of excluded interventions to include phototherapy and photoprotection, whichwere not originally listed in the protocol, for clarification only. This does not represent a change in methodology.Types of outcome measures: in a previous version of the review, under Primary outcomes, we added 'percentage of people with' toour 'complete resolution of skin lesions…' and 'clearing of erythema…' outcomes, and these have been retained (Jessop 2009 ). Notethat we accepted the following terms to describe complete resolution: complete clearing, clearing, marked improvement and excellentimprovement.Searching other resource: although not planned in the protocol, we searched Index Medicus by hand for studies relating to treatment of
discoid lupus erythematosus for the years 1956 to 1966 because we thought it important, and we recorded all adverse events reported inthe included and excluded studies as we recognise the need to report adverse events.Search methods for identification of studies: the databases and date ranges that we planned to search in the protocol have beenextended for this update review, in line with current standard search methods.Data collection and analysis: In the original protocol, we had not made plans at all regarding how to deal with within-patient studies,missing data, sensitivity analysis, and 'Summary of findings' tables, but we now have in line with current requirements.Where results are estimated for individual studies with low numbers of outcomes (< 10 in total) or where the total sample size is less than30 participants, we decided to report the proportion of outcomes in each treatment group together with a P value from a Fisher’s Exact
test. This follows guidance provided by the Skin Group Statistics editors on how to deal with small numbers, made available since the lastupdate of this review.
test. This follows guidance provided by the Skin Group Statistics editors on how to deal with small numbers, made available since the lastupdate of this review."We tested statistical heterogeneity using the I/two.sups statistic (0% to 40%: may not be important; 30% to 60%: may represent moderateheterogeneity; 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity; 75% to 100%: represents considerable heterogeneity) (Higgins2011).” An assessment of how we would deal with heterogeneity was missing from the original protocol therefore we have amended thisat this stage in the event that future updates of this review will contain a pooled analysis of two or more studies.Assessment of risk of bias in included studies: the text within this section was written in the 'Quality rating of included studies' sectionof the protocol. The review has been amended to follow the RevMan 5 recommended headings and the new Cochrane Handbook forSystematic Reviews of Interventions guidelines.

CochraneLibraryTrusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health./uni00A0/uni00A0Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsTwo additional headings have been added to this section: Comparability of the two arms and Intention to treat analysis.According to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, controlled trials that allocate participants by quasi-randomisation, or that fail to conceal allocation during recruitment, are at risk of selection bias. We have included such trials, but haveindicated that there is high risk of selection bias.Imbalance at baseline has been assessed in this version of the review and added to the risk of bias tables.Measures of treatment eﬀect: although not planned in the protocol, for any significant outcomes (P < 0.05) we wanted to present thenumber needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) where the first treatment in the comparison is harmful (risk ratio (RR)
> 1 for safety outcomes). We did not do this as no significant harms were reported.In the protocol, we did not pre-state the eﬀect measures that we would report. For dichotomous outcomes (primary outcomes 1 and 2and adverse events), results are presented as RR with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For this update, for continuous outcomes (primaryoutcome 3), we planned to present results in the form of mean diﬀerences (with 95% CIs). Where there were treatment comparisons wherestudies used diﬀerent scales for the same outcome, we planned to convert results to standard mean diﬀerences (SMD) to allow pooling ofresults. We could not carry out these plans because the studies were few and heterogeneous.Unit of analysis issues > Cross-over trials: in the protocol we did not plan how to analyse cross-over trials; but having included sucha study, we followed the guidance provided in Section 16.4.4 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins
2011). Where no evidence of a carry-over eﬀect was present, analyses of paired diﬀerences were presented if these data could be obtainedfrom the trial report. Otherwise, only data from the first treatment period were used.Unit of analysis issues >Within-patient studies: although not planned in the protocol, internally controlled trials were analysed usingtechniques for paired designs (e.g. paired t-test, McNemar's test). Where appropriate, these were included in additional data tables andnot pooled with parallel group trials.Assessment of heterogeneity: in the protocol, we had planned to use statistical tests for homogeneity between studies. However,assessment of heterogeneity was not performed as no findings were based on pooled results from 2 or more trials.Data synthesis: in the protocol, we planned to draw up a synthesis of included trials; however, this was not possible with the data in the
studies we found, due to heterogeneity of study methods and interventions. No two trials investigated the same interventions.Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity: in the protocol, we had planned to perform subgroup analysis on the followingmeasures: disseminated DLE versus localised DLE; DLE with systemic lupus versus DLE without systemic lupus; histologically proven versusclinically diagnosed DLE; and eﬀect of ethnic group on outcome. However, we were unable to address these issues, as none of the studiesprovided data on individual subgroups, (and two of the trials enrolled small numbers of participants).Trials that included more than one subset of cutaneous lupus were included if most participants had DLE and the outcome data describedoutcomes for DLE.Other: we planned where possible to calculate cost eﬀectiveness ratios using quality-of life-measures; however, the studies identified didnot provide these data.
