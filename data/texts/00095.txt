Non-Sunscreen Photoprotection: Antioxidants AddValue to a SunscreenMary S. Matsui1, Andrew Hsia2, Janine D. Miller2, Kaija Hanneman2, Heather Scull2, Kevin D. Cooper2,3andElma Baron2,3The association between ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure and both skin cancer and photo-aging is welldocumented. In addition to the conventional organic-chemical and physical-mineral type sunscreens, othernon-sunscreen protective strategies have been developed. These include topically applied botanical extractsand other antioxidants as well as topical DNA repair enzymes. Standard terms of photoprotection such as sunprotection factor (SPF) do not accurately reflect the photoprotection benefits of these materials. For example, inspite of minimal SPF, tea extract containing polyphenols such as ( /C0)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has beenshown to protect against UV-induced DNA damage and immune suppression, in part through its ability to
reduce oxidative stress and inhibit NF-kB. The addition of botanical antioxidants and vitamins C and E to abroad-spectrum sunscreen may further decrease UV-induced damage compared with sunscreen alone. Theseagents have been shown to enhance protection against UV-induced epidermal thickening, overexpression ofMMP-1and MMP-9, and depletion of CD1aþLangerhans cells. Non-sunscreen materials such as botanicalextracts, antioxidants, and DNA repair enzymes can contribute value when applied topically to human skinin vivo .Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings (2009) 14,56–59; doi:10.1038/jidsymp.2009.14INTRODUCTION
INTRODUCTIONThere is growing interest in the potential for ‘‘non-sunscreen’’agents to add protection against exposure to ultravioletradiation (UVR). This review summarizes several salientpoints about this issue, including how non-sunscreen agentsare different from sunscreens in their mechanism of action, inthe different end points important in measuring efficacy, andin the benefits of their use. In addition, a preliminary study inwhich antioxidants were added to a broad-spectrum sun-screen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 25 is reported.It is important to decrease UV exposure by avoidingexcessive time in the sun, wearing protective clothing, andusing a sunscreen. It should also be noted that no sunscreen iseffective in reducing total UVR exposure under everyscenario. This would suggest that sunscreens are to berecommended, but that there are additional topical measuresthat can be taken to further reduce damage that ordinarilywould lead to photo-aging and skin cancer.
It has been suggested that augmenting sunscreens withactive natural ingredients can help increase the photoprotec-tive qualities of sunscreens and offer greater protection topatients, but there has been little clinical research to show: (a)exactly what ingredients, (b) at what concentration, (c)combined with which other materials, are beneficial tohuman skin.A cascade of reactions occurs on exposure of human skinto sunlight, primarily owing to the ultraviolet wavelengths(UVRs). It is well known that UVR induces an array ofdamage ‘‘end points’’ in human skin, including pyrimidinedimers, oxidative DNA damage, mtDNA damage, release ofpro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokines, isomer-ization of trans-urocanic acid to the immunosuppressive cis-urocanic acid, and p53 mutations, in addition to the easilyobservable erythema on which SPF is based. It is sensible,therefore, that many of the non-traditional sun protection
agents be tested against these additional end points forpossible protective capabilities. Wavelengths in the UVAportion of the spectrum (320– 400 nm) have been shown toinduce oxidative stress through reactive oxygen species(ROS), including singlet oxygen, and other non-radical andradical ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide and the superoxideradical. (Grether-Beck et al ., 1996; Berneburg et al ., 1999;Klotz et al ., 2001; Bachelor and Bowden, 2004; Halliday,
Klotz et al ., 2001; Bachelor and Bowden, 2004; Halliday,2005). This oxidative stress leads to DNA lesions such as8-hydroxy-20deoxyguanine (8-OH-dG), which has beenproposed as a critical source of mutations, as UVA penetratesORIGINAL ARTICLE56 Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings (2009), Volume 14 &2009 The Society for Investigative DermatologyReceived 14 November 2008; accepted 18 December 20081The Clinique Laboratories, New York, NY, USA;2Department of Dermatology, University Hospitals, Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USA and3Dermatology, Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USACorrespondence: Dr Mary S.

farther than UVB into the skin, and it may transform stemcells (Agar et al., 2004).In an attempt to block some of the damage caused by sunexposure, antioxidants have been explored as a means to dealwith UVR-induced oxidative stress, and UVA radiation inparticular. Some topical and systemic antioxidants includeresveratrol, vitamin E, vitamin C, ( /C0)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and retinyl palmitate (retinoids) (for reviews, see Afaqand Mukhtar, 2006 and Wright et al., 2006). Some materialsare more accurately referred to as plant extracts (althoughthere is clearly an overlap with the previous category), andthey have also been reported to protect the skin againstvarious UVR-induced damage end points. The extracts bestsupported by experimental evidence include tea extracts(Elmets et al ., 2001), lutein (Lee et al ., 2004), tamarind(Kuchel et al., 2005), certain flavonoids (Moore et al., 2006;Linet al ., 2008), fern extract (Caccialanza et al ., 2007;
Siscovick et al., 2008), pycnogenol (Sime and Reeve, 2004),and lycopene (Stahl and Sies, 2007). Topical DNA repairenzymes were first introduced over a decade ago as potentialtherapies for UV-induced damage, specifically for thosepatients who are genetically deficient in repair enzymes(xeroderma pigmentosum) (Yarosh et al., 2001). Since then,the variety of available repair enzymes has increased (toinclude those targeting oxidative DNA lesions), along withthe increased sophistication of delivery systems and the morewidespread commercial use of this technology (Yarosh et al.,2005; Ke et al., 2007). Recently, our group reported on therole of topical DNA repair enzymes in preventing UV-induced immunosuppression (Lucas et al , 2008). Topicalapplication of repair enzymes, although effective only afterUV exposure, may be an important new weapon in the fightagainst sunlight-induced skin cancer.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo test the hypothesis that non-erythema end points
indicative of UV damage could be prevented better by theaddition of antioxidants to a commercial sunscreen, apreliminary study was performed. Five volunteers wereenrolled after written informed consent. The mean age was25, and the range was 18–40 years. Subjects were ofFitzpatrick skin types I-III, primarily II. The mean minimalerythema dose (MED) was 52 mJ cm/C02, with a range of20–60 mJ cm/C02. Subjects were treated with two test products:(1) a commercially available skin moisturizer with an SPF of25 also containing antioxidants (that is, sunscreens plusantioxidants); and (2) the same SPF 25 moisturizer withoutthe antioxidants (that is, sunscreens alone).Immune suppression has been shown to be a critical
aspect of UVR-induced non-melanoma skin carcinogenesis.Depletion of epidermal Langerhans cells (LC), the skin’santigen-presenting cells, has been used as a surrogate forimmune suppression, although functional disturbances mayexist before the numbers are significantly decreased. In thepreliminary study reported here, LCs were quantified toreflect the efficacy of the test materials in protecting againstUVR-induced immune suppression. Both sunscreens alone(SS) and sunscreens þantioxidants (SS þAOx) resulted insignificant protection against solar-simulated UV-inducedreduction in LC numbers in human subjects (Figure 1). Theaverage UV-induced reduction of LC in skin irradiated withtwo times the MED was 35% compared with non-irradiatedsites. In sites pre-treated with SS alone or with SS þAOx, theaverage reduction of LC was 0 and 4%, respectively. Therewas no significant difference between the two treatments.UVR has been shown to activate matrix metalloprotei-
nases (MMPs), and recent studies have determined thatMMP1 is the major enzyme implicated in collagen damageand photo-aging of UV-irradiated human skin (Brennan et al,2003). Therefore, this study also asked whether the additionof antioxidants to an SPF 25 sunscreen would improveprotection against solar-simulated UVR-induced activation of
2003). Therefore, this study also asked whether the additionof antioxidants to an SPF 25 sunscreen would improveprotection against solar-simulated UVR-induced activation ofMMP1. Both sunscreens and sunscreens þantioxidants re-duced the expression of MMP1 relative to unprotected UV-irradiated control skin (Figures 2 and 3). SS alone decreasedthe level of MMP1 per area by 43%, whereas SS þAOxdiminished MMP1 production by 60%. The difference inprotection between the SS alone and the SS þAOx wassignificant, and suggests that additional benefit against sundamage can be gained by adding antioxidants to sunscreens.It has been known for some time that UVA is particularlyefficient at inducing ROS and degradative dermal enzymes,so it is logical that antioxidants might prevent this end pointin particular (Scharffetter et al , 1991). In theory, topically
applied antioxidants should reduce the damage caused byROS, impede or lessen tissue damage, and promote repairafter UVR. This study shows that it is possible to increaseprotection from UV radiation by a broad-spectrum SPF 25sunscreen product through the addition of selected antiox-idant botanical ingredients. Further, as the SS þAOx for-mulation is a commercially available product that has beenshown to be stable, safe, and efficacious, this suggests a realdevelopmental advance in sun protection.05101520P=0.052 MEDwithSS + AOx2 MEDwithSS only2 MED No UVRelative number of LC cm–2Figure 1 .Effect of Sunscreen and Antioxidants on Langerhan’s cell number(CD1a þcells).

MATERIALS AND METHODSAll procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board ofUniversity Hospitals of Cleveland.Products testedTwo formulations with an SPF of 25 were tested, one with addedantioxidants (SS þAOx) and one without (SS alone). The UV filterswere benzophenone, avobenzone, and octylmethoxycinnamate.The antioxidants were caffeine, vitamin E, vitamin C (aminopropylascorbyl phosphate), echinacea pallida extract, gorgonian extract,and chamomile essential oil. The label SPF was determined by CPTLaboratories (Fairfield, NJ) following FDA guidelines.UV light sourcessUVR was delivered using a 1,000 Watt xenon arc solar simulatormodel 6271 (Oriel Instruments, Stratford, CT), with a dichroic mirrorand 81017bis filter (WG320 per 1.5 mm), producing a spectrum of290–400 nm. Irradiance was measured using an IL1700 radiometer
(International Light, Newburyport, MA) equipped with a sensor forUVA (SED 033, UVA filter no. 19672) and UVB (SED 240, UVB filterno. 15541) positioned 10 inches from the light source.ProtocolA schematic summary of the study protocol is provided (Figure 4).Individual baseline MED and SPF determinations were performed(days 0, 1). On day 2, each of the two test products (SS andSSþAOx) was applied on separate areas on the buttock at a dose of2m gc m/C02. Fifteen minutes later, simulated solar radiation (ssUVR)was delivered on these sites as well as on a third site that was notpre-treated with any product. For the product-treated sites, the doseof UV delivered was calculated as 2 /C2MED multiplied by the SPF ofthe product, to account for the UV filtration provided by thesunscreens. Each site measured 2.5 /C22.5 cm. A fourth site was
marked but not exposed to UV to serve as control. Two days afterirradiation (day 4), skin punch biopsies were obtained from the fourskin sites mentioned above.Tissue analysisImmunohistochemical staining for CD1a þcells (LC) and MMP1was performed on frozen sections from the punch biopsies. Acetone-fixed 4–6 mm cryostat sections were stained using a Vectastain EliteABC reagent kit that contained blocking serum (Mouse IgG, PK-6102), biotinylated secondary antibody, and Avidin DH/biotinylatedHRP (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Samples were incubated with apurified mouse anti-human CD1A monoclonal antibody 1:500dilution (Immunotech, Cat. No. 1590, Emeryville, CA). MouseIgG2a kappa, M-7769 was used as isotype control (Sigma-AldrichInc., St Louis, MO). For MMP1 detection, samples were incubated inmouse anti-MMP1 monoclonal antibody or mouse IgG1 isotypecontrol overnight (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN: diluted1:250 in 3% normal horse serum in PBS).
