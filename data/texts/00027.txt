Shade  tolerance:  when  growing  tall  isnot  an  optionCharlotte  M.M.  Gommers1,  Eric  J.W.  Visser2,  Kate  R.  St  Onge1,Laurentius  A.C.J.  Voesenek1,  and  Ronald  Pierik11Plant  Ecophysiology,  Institute  of  Environmental  Biology,  Utrecht  University,  Padualaan  8,  3584  CH  Utrecht,  The  Netherlands2Experimental  Plant  Ecology,  Institute  for  Water  and  Wetland  Research,  Radboud  University  Nijmegen,  Toernooiveld  1,6525  ED  Nijmegen,  The  NetherlandsTwo  different  plant  strategies  exist  to  deal  with  shade:shade  avoidance  and  shade  tolerance.  All  shade-exposedplants  optimize  photosynthesis  to  adapt  to  the  decreasein  light  quality  and  quantity.  When  shaded,  most  speciesin  open  habitats  express  the  shade-avoidance  syndrome,a  growth  response  to  escape  shade.  Shade-tolerantspecies  from  forest  understories  cannot  outgrowsurrounding  trees  and  adopt  a  tolerance  response.  Unlike
shade  avoidance,  virtually  nothing  is  known  aboutregulation  of  shade  tolerance.  In  this  opinion  article,  wediscuss  potential  modes  of  molecular  regulation  to  adopta  shade-tolerance  rather  than  a  shade-avoidance  strategy.We  argue  that  molecular  approaches  using  model  andnon-model  species  should  help  identify  the  molecularpathways  that  underpin  shade  tolerance,  thus  providingknowledge  for  further  crop  improvement.Shade  responses:  identifying  the  knowledge  gapUnderneath  a  leaf  canopy,  light  availability  is  severelyreduced.  For  example,  a  single  Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsisthaliana )  leaf  can  reduce  the  photosynthetic  active  radia-tion  (PAR,  see  Glossary )  from  1500  to  120  mmol  photons  m–2s–1[1].  A  substantial  amount  of  research  has  focused  onthe  ecology  and  ecophysiology  of  shade  tolerance,  particu-larly  of  tree  seedlings.  This  work  has  largely  elucidated
trade-offs  among  various  physiological  and  morphologicalcharacteristics  such  as  speciﬁc  leaf  area  (SLA),  leaf  lon-gevity,  root:shoot  ratio,  relative  growth  rate,  dark  respira-tion  rate,  and  elongation  response  to  shade  (reviewed  in[2]).  This  research  has  demonstrated  that  shade  toleranceis  not  only  a  lack  of  the  classic  shade-avoidance  syndrome(SAS;  strong  elongation  growth  away  from  shaded  micro-conditions  and  accelerated  ﬂowering)  but  also  a  complexand  speciﬁc  adaptation  to  life  in  the  shade.  However,  todate,  few  studies  have  focused  on  herbaceous  shade-tolerant  species  that  complete  their  entire  life  cycle  in  theshade  [3],  or  on  the  underlying  molecular  regulation  ofthe  shade-tolerant  phenotype.  This  is  in  stark  contrast  tothe  wealth  of  research  effort  that  has  been  focused  on  themolecular  mechanisms  of  SAS  in  a  variety  of  herbs(reviewed  in  [1,4]).
(reviewed  in  [1,4]).Given  that  shade-avoidance  responses  are  an  undesir-able  characteristic  of  nearly  all  major  crops,  understandinghow  shade-tolerant  plants  prevent  these  responses  is  agro-nomically  important.  Crops  are  typically  grown  at  highdensities  and,  hence,  are  exposed  to  light  signals  that  inducethe  SAS.  This  leads  to  carbon  being  allocated  towards  stemelongation  at  the  expense  of  root  and  leaf  development  andtherefore  affects  the  yield  [5,6].  Although  most  modern‘Green  Revolution’  crops  are  semi-dwarfs  [7],  they  stillcompete  for  light  in  their  monocultures  and  show  shade-avoidance  responses  [6].  Understanding  how  shade-tolerantspecies  suppress  the  SAS  and  direct  energy  and  resourcestowards  other  pathways,  such  as  optimization  of  photosyn-thesis  and  physical  defense,  could  be  useful  in  targetedbreeding  programs.  This  might  lead  towards  crop  varieties
towards  other  pathways,  such  as  optimization  of  photosyn-thesis  and  physical  defense,  could  be  useful  in  targetedbreeding  programs.  This  might  lead  towards  crop  varietieswhich,  when  grown  in  high  density,  do  not  invest  in  unde-sirable  shoot  elongation,  but  do  adapt  their  shaded,  lowerstrata  of  the  vegetation  for  more  efﬁcient  photosynthesis  inlow  PAR.  Earlier  studies  in  tobacco  (Nicotiana  tabacum )have  shown  that  SAS  suppression  does  indeed  stimulateharvest  index  [8],  demonstrating  that  altering  the  SASresponse  can  effect  agronomically  important  traits.From  an  ecological  and  evolutionary  point  of  view,understanding  molecular  mechanisms  of  shade  toleranceshould  help  us  to  understand  how  herbaceous  speciesbecame  successful  in  the  forest  understory,  where  they  fulﬁllan  important  role  in  nutrient  uptake  from  the  soil  [8].

garlic  mustard  (Alliaria  petiolata )  in  northern  Americanforests  [9].In  this  opinion  article,  we  examine  three  hypotheticalmodes  for  the  molecular  regulation  of  shade  tolerance:differential  control  of  speciﬁc  Phytochrome-InteractingFactor  (PIF)  proteins,  speciﬁc  modiﬁcations  of  plant  hor-mone  pathways,  and  increased  involvement  of  molecularshade-avoidance  antagonists.  We  argue  that  addressingquestions  about  the  molecular  regulation  of  shade  toler-ance  will  require  an  approach  that  takes  advantage  of  thegenetic  tools  available  in  model  species  and  also  venturesinto  the  genetics  of  wild  non-model  species.Shade  and  shade  perceptionPlants  living  in  dense  communities  experience  a  strongreduction  in  light  intensity  and  a  change  in  light  qualitybecause  of  light  absorption  and  reﬂection  by  surroundingvegetation.  The  chlorophyll  of  neighboring  plants  ﬁlters
out  the  red  (R,  l  =  600–700  nm)  and  blue  (B,  l  =  400–500  nm)  wavelengths  of  the  sunlight  while  reﬂecting  andtransmitting  most  of  the  far-red  (FR)  wavelengths  (l  =700–800  nm).  As  a  consequence  there  is  a  drop  in  the  R:FRratio  in  dense  vegetation  [10],  which  is  sensed  by  plants  asa  cue  for  competitors.  In  combination  with  a  reduction  of  Blight  [11]  and  total  light  intensity  (PAR,  l  =  400–700  nm),these  light  cues  can  result  in  two  different  plant  strategiesto  cope  with  shade  (Figure  1).  In  many  species,  when  a  lowR:FR  ratio  is  sensed  by  the  phytochrome  photoreceptorfamily  [12],  a  suite  of  traits  to  grow  towards  the  light  areinduced;  this  is  known  as  the  SAS  (Box  1)  [1].  This  strategyis  common  in  vegetation  where  the  plants  are  of  approxi-mately  similar  heights,  such  as  grasslands,  and  includes
elongation  of  stems  and  petioles,  apical  dominance,upward  movement  of  the  leaves  (hyponasty),  and  reducedbranching  (Figure  1)  [1,13–15] .  By  contrast,  some  species,which  we  will  refer  to  as  shade  species,  have  adapted  theirphenotype  to  cope  permanently  with  shaded  environ-ments,  such  as  forest  understories,  where  it  is  impossibleto  outgrow  the  tall  neighboring  trees  (Figure  1).The  dos  and  don’ts  of  shade  toleranceWhen  exposed  to  shade,  both  shade  and  non-shade  spe-cies  will  optimize  light  capture  and  utilization  by  increas-ing  their  SLA  [16],  lowering  chlorophyll  a:b  ratios,  andincreasing  photosystem  (PS)  II:I  ratios  [17],  which  arecomponents  of  what  is  known  as  the  carbon  gain  hypoth-esis  for  shade  tolerance  (reviewed  in  [2,18] )  Furthermore,typical  shade-tolerant  species  suppress  shade-avoidancetraits.  These  woodland  species  show  little  shade-induced
plasticity  in  photosynthetic  traits  and  reduced,  or  absent,elongation  responses  in  stems  and  petioles  comparedwith  open  habitat  species  [19,20] .  Shade-tolerant  treeseedlings  [21,22]  and  herbaceous  species  [23]  have  lowerrelative  growth  rates  compared  with  shade-intolerantspecies,  both  in  high-  and  low-light  conditions.  Relativegrowth  rate  is  generally  positively  correlated  with  SLAand  increased  SLA  in  shade  greatly  enhances  carbongain  [16].  However,  a  high  SLA  can  have  negative  con-sequences  for  plant  survival  in  shade  [24]  given  thatproducing  a  large  leaf  area  at  little  construction  costmakes  these  leaves  sensitive  to  mechanical  stress  andherbivory  [25].  It  follows  that  a  high  level  of  defense  iscommonly  assumed  to  be  a  driving  force  for  survival  indeep  shade,  a  concept  also  referred  to  as  the  stress-
tolerance  hypothesis  [21]  (reviewed  in  [2]).  Various  shadetolerators  therefore  appear  to  channel  energy  away  from
deep  shade,  a  concept  also  referred  to  as  the  stress-tolerance  hypothesis  [21]  (reviewed  in  [2]).  Various  shadetolerators  therefore  appear  to  channel  energy  away  fromelongation  and  optimal  photosynthesis  towards  leaf  sur-vival  [24,26] .Stem elonga/g415onShade avoidance Shade tolerancePe/g415ole elonga/g415onHyponastyReduced branching High physical defenseLow PAR Reduced PARLow R:FR Low R:FRLow blue Low blueIncreased PSII:PSI ra/g415o*Reduced ChI a:b ra/g415o*Increased SLA*TRENDS in Plant Science Figure  1.  Two  different  strategies  to  cope  with  shade:  shade  avoidance,  which  is  seen  in,  for  example,  grasslands  (left:  meadow  in  Emmereis,  Allga ¨u,  Germany)  and  shadetolerance,  which  is  common  in  forest  understories  (right:  forest  understory  in  Bennekom,  Gelderland,  The  Netherlands).  All  plants  perceive  the  canopy-associated  changes
in  light  quality  (reduced  red:far-red  ratio,  reduced  blue)  and  quantity  [reduced  total  light  intensity  (photosynthetic  active  radiation,  PAR)].  In  shade-avoiding  species,  thisperception  leads  to  the  induction  of  a  set  of  traits  to  reach  for  the  light  (elongation  of  stem  and  petioles,  hyponasty,  and  reduced  branching)  called  shade  avoidance.  Shade-tolerating  plants  typically  optimize  carbon  gain  [increased  specific  leaf  area  (SLA)  and  photosystem  (PS)II:PSI  ratio,  reduced  chlorophyll  (Chl)  a:b  ratio]  and  minimizedamage  (increased  physical  defense),  although  some  traits  are  induced  in  both  shade-avoiding  and  shade-tolerating  species  (marked  with  *).Opinion Trends  in  Plant  Science  February  2013,  Vol.  18,  No.  266
Could  understanding  the  SAS  clear  the  way  towardsidentifying  shade-tolerance  regulators?Like  all  higher  plants,  shade  species  carry  photoreceptors(phytochromes,  cryptochromes,  and  phototropins)  to  detectchanges  in  light  quality  and  quantity  [11,27,28] .  A  centralquestion  here  is  which  differences  in  the  pathway  betweenphotoreceptor  signaling  and  phenotypic  output  determinewhether  a  shade-avoidance  or  shade-tolerance  strategy  isadopted.  Given  that  both  shade  and  non-shade  species  per-ceive  shade  in  the  same  way  and  there  is  even  overlap  insome  aspects  of  the  response  (i.e.,  both  show  increased  SLA,PSI:PSII  ratios  and  lower  chlorophyll  a:b  ratios),  it  isconceivable  that  some  regulatory  components  are  sharedbetween  shade  avoidance  and  shade  tolerance.  In  theabsence  of  rigorous  molecular  and  physiological  studies  on
the  regulatory  mechanisms  of  shade  tolerance,  we  proposesome  hypotheses  for  molecular  regulation  from  insightsgained  from  studies  of  shade-avoidance  control.  We  discussthree  hypothetical  modes  of  regulation  below:  PIF  proteins,plant  hormones,  and  molecular  shade-avoidance  antagonists.PIFs  (Box  1)  play  an  important  role  in  shade-avoidanceresponses;  however,  there  are  indications  that  differentBox  1.  Molecular  regulation  of  the  shade-avoidance  syndromeShade-avoiding  plants  typically  reach  for  light,  by  rapidly  elongatingtheir  stems  and  petioles  and  bending  their  leaves  upward  (hyponasty),and  show  accelerated  flowering.  Far-red  (FR)  reflection  from  leavesleads  to  a  reduced  R:FR  ratio,  leading  to  a  photo  conversion  of  activephytochrome  (Pfr)  to  inactive  Pr  (Figure  I)  [72].  Under  normal  sunlight
conditions,  Pfr  is  present  in  the  nucleus  of  the  plant,  where  it  binds  anddegrades  a  subset  of  bHLH  transcription  factors,  PIFs.  The  pool  of  PIFsthat  are  not  degraded  are  physically  bound  by  so-called  DELLA  proteins[45].  Shade-induced  inactivation  of  PhyB  derepresses  PIF-regulatedgene  expression  [73]  and  leads  to  GA-mediated  DELLA  degradation,which  further  increases  the  PIF  protein  pool  (Figure  I)  [45].  As  a  result,under  low  R:FR  conditions,  PIFs  bind  promoters  and  regulate  theexpression  of  target  genes  to  promote  shade  avoidance,  including  agroup  of  HD-Zip  class  II  subfamily  transcription  factors  (such  as  ATHB-2and  ATHB-4)  [30,74,75] ,  as  well  as  genes  involved  in  auxin  signaling(via  PIF4  and  PIF5  [37])  and  biosynthesis  (via  PIF4,  PIF5,  and  PIF7  [30]),(Figure  I).  Recent  studies  reveal  different  functions  for  different  PIFs.
PIF4  and  PIF5  are  particularly  effective  regulators  of  low  PAR-regulatedgene  expression  and  hypocotyl  elongation  [37],  and  are  required  forcryptochrome-mediated  hyponasty  and  petiole  elongation  in  low  bluelight  [38].  PIF7,  by  contrast,  is  an  important  regulator  of  low  R:FR-induced  hypocotyl  elongation  and  gene  expression  [30].  Auxin  haslong  been  proposed,  but  only  recently  demonstrated,  to  be  a  keyregulator  of  shade  avoidance.  Upon  detection  of  a  low  R:FR  ratio,  auxinbiosynthesis  is  increased  [76],  at  least  in  part  through  PIF7-mediatedexpression  of  several  YUCCA  genes  [30].  Subsequently,  auxin  istransported  through  PIN3  proteins  towards  the  epidermis  to  controlcell  elongation  [41].  As  a  result,  auxin  mutants  have  reduced  or  absentshade-avoidance  responses  to  low  R:FR  ratios  [41,76–78] .  Auxinfrequently  interacts  with  brassinosteroid,  a  potent  growth  stimulator
that  is  also  required  for  the  SAS  in  response  to  low  R:FR  ratios  [79]  andin  response  to  blue  light  depletion  [38,80] .  Finally,  production  of  the
that  is  also  required  for  the  SAS  in  response  to  low  R:FR  ratios  [79]  andin  response  to  blue  light  depletion  [38,80] .  Finally,  production  of  thegaseous  hormone  ethylene  is  enhanced  when  the  ratio  of  R:FR  is  low  ina  variety  of  species  [81],  including  Arabidopsis  [77],  and  promotes  alight  quality-mediated  SAS  (Figure  I)  [40,82] .  Ethylene  can  also  act  as  avolatile  neighbor-detection  cue  in  dense  canopy  [82].Antagonists  of  shade  avoidance  prevent  excessive  elongation  inshade.  PIF4  and  PIF5  promote  the  production  of  another,  but  non-DNA  binding,  member  of  the  PIF  family:  HFR1,  which  subsequentlybinds  and  inactivates  PIF4  and  PIF5  proteins  [50,83] ,  thus  inhibitingthe  SAS  (Figure  I).  A  low  R:FR  ratio  also  induces  the  expression  of  twoother  atypical  bHLH  proteins,  PAR1  and  PAR2,  which  suppress  several
auxin-mediated  shade-avoidance  responses  (Figure  I)  [49].  Further-more,  shade-avoidance  responses  to  a  low  R:FR  ratio  are  reduced  byPhyA  (Figure  I)  [52],  because  contrary  to  the  other  phytochromes,  itsactivity  is  enhanced  by  FR  light  through  the  so-called  FR-HighIrradiance  Response.  Accordingly,  PhyA  overexpression  leads  toseverely  impaired  SAS  and  dwarfing  [84].Phytoch rome  B,  D, E Phytoch rome ARed lig ht   (655-665 nm)Far-red lig ht   (725-735 nm)Blue light   (400-500 nm)CryptochromesEthylene GibberellinAuxinBrassinost eroidPIF7 DELLAsHFR1ATHB2 ATHB4PAR1Neighbor induced elonga/g415onPAR2CanopyPIF4PIF5TRENDS in Plant Science Figure  I.

PIFs  may  interact  with  photoreceptors  in  slightly  differentways  to  mediate  a  shade-avoidance  response.  For  example,although  no  Pfr-induced  degradation  of  PIF7  has  beenobserved  [29],  PIF4  and  PIF5  are  rapidly  degraded  uponphytochrome  conversion  from  inactive  Pr  to  active  Pfr.  Thelight-stable  PIF7  transcription  factor  is  dephosphorylatedin  shade  and  regulates  auxin  biosynthesis  in  shade,  there-by  promoting  hypocotyl  elongation  [30].  However,  PIF7also  carries  a  repressing  domain  [29,31,32] ,  and  this  po-tential  for  a  dual  function  in  controlling  transcriptionsuggests  that  there  might  be  a  role  for  PIFs  in  the  sup-pression  of  SAS  and/or  promotion  of  shade-tolerance  traits.Tissue-speciﬁc  absence  of  PIF  proteins  could  also  lead  todifferential  control  of  shade  avoidance.  Studies  focused  onthe  regulation  of  Arabidopsis  hypocotyl  elongation  by  PIF4
and  PIF5  found  that  only  the  pif4  pif5  double  mutantshowed  reduced,  but  not  absent  hypocotyl  elongation  whenthe  R:FR  ratio  was  low,  suggesting  a  functional  overlapbetween  these  two  PIFs  [33].  However,  a  complete  loss  ofPIFs  in  shade-tolerant  plants  is  unlikely  given  that  theseplants  do  show  other  phytochrome-regulated  responses,such  as  altered  chlorophyll  accumulation  and  chloroplastdevelopment,  that  may  still  be  PIF-dependent  [17,34,35] .PIF1  and  PIF3  are  known  to  play  important  roles  in  the  de-etiolation  process  and  development  of  chloroplast  andphotosynthesis-related  compounds,  in  Arabidopsis  seed-lings  experiencing  light  and  day–night  changes  [35,36] .Interestingly,  it  was  shown  recently  that  although  PIF4and  PIF5  play  a  relatively  limited  role  in  low  R:FR-inducedSAS,  they  are  key  players  in  low  PAR  and  low  blue  induced
responses  [37,38] ,  although  the  molecular  mechanism  bywhich  cryptochrome  photoreceptors  control  PIFs  is  un-known.  This  strong  PIF4  and  PIF5  involvement  in  plantresponses  to  low  blue  light  and  low  PAR  conditions  makesthese  particular  PIF  proteins  interesting  candidates  forcontrolling  shade  tolerate  responses  which  are  particularlyinduced  by  low  light  conditions  (Figure  1).Interaction  between  several  hormones  [auxin,  ethyl-ene,  gibberellin  (GA),  and  brassinosteroids]  is  importantin  the  regulation  of  SAS  (Box  1).  The  elongation  responseto  a  low  R:FR  ratio  may  be  suppressed  in  shade-tolerantspecies  by  differential  hormone  production  and  respon-siveness.  However,  it  is  unlikely  that  shade-tolerant  spe-cies  are  completely  insensitive  or  lacking  for  one  or  more  ofthese  hormones  given  that  they  play  important  pleiotropic
roles  in  plant  developmental  processes  [39,40] .  Neverthe-less,  it  is  reasonable  to  suggest  that  hormonal  regulatorsin  the  shade-induced  pathway  are  upregulated  or  down-regulated  in  both  organ-speciﬁc  and  treatment-speciﬁcmanners.  A  lack  of  PIN-FORMED  3  (PIN3)-mediatedlateral  auxin  transport  under  low  R:FR  speciﬁcally  inthe  hypocotyl  would,  for  example,  prevent  auxin  accumu-lation  and  elongation  of  the  hypocotyl  under  low  R:FRconditions  [41].  At  the  same  time,  vital  developmentalresponses  to  auxin  would  be  undisturbed,  as  evidencedby  the  otherwise  normal  phenotype  of  pin3  mutants  [41].Targeted  differences  in  the  induction  or  repression  ofhormone  signal  transduction  components  could  also  leadtowards  modiﬁed  hormone  responses.  Indeed,  PIF4  andPIF5  appear  to  directly  regulate  expression  of  auxin
signal  transduction  components  [37]  and  modiﬁcationsin  promoters  of  these  genes  might,  for  example,  modifysuch  PIF-mediated  regulation  of  auxin  responsiveness.
signal  transduction  components  [37]  and  modiﬁcationsin  promoters  of  these  genes  might,  for  example,  modifysuch  PIF-mediated  regulation  of  auxin  responsiveness.Increased  SLA  could  hypothetically  be  caused  by  upregu-lation  of  a  phytochrome-dependent  kinetin  (a  cytokinin),given  that  this  hormone  stimulates  expansion  of  leaflaminas  in  the  dark  [42,43] .  GA,  a  general  growth-promot-ing  hormone  that  also  enhances  leaf  unrolling  in  the  dark[42],  would  be  another  obvious  candidate  to  regulatechanges  in  leaf  area  and  SLA.  However,  GA  is  also  apotent  stimulator  of  SAS  [44],  which  is  suppressed  inshade-tolerant  species  (Box  1).  It  could  be  argued  thatthis  would  be  most  effective  if  GA  would  be  controlledindependently  between  leaf  laminas  and  primordia,where  SLA  is  determined  versus  internodes  and  petioleswhere  SAS  is  regulated.  Nonetheless,  enhancing  GA  alone
does  not  necessarily  lead  to  elevated  petiole  elongation  inArabidopsis  [45],  implying  that  GA  regulation  could  berelatively  aspeciﬁc  and  that  additional  factors  (e.g.,  PIFaccumulation  upon  low  R:FR-mediated  phytochrome  in-activation)  determine  its  ability  to  induce  SAS  [46,47] .Enhanced  induction  of  antagonistic  regulators  of  SASresponses  during  low  R:FR  and  low  blue  (Box  1)  might  be  athird  alternative  scenario  to  at  least  suppress  shade  avoid-ance  in  shade-tolerant  species.  Even  in  shade-avoidingArabidopsis ,  low  R:FR  induces  several  atypical,  non-DNA-binding  basic  helix–loop–helix  (bHLH)  proteins  thatantagonize  induction  of  shade  avoidance.  These  proteinsinclude  Long  Hypocotyl  in  Far-red  Light  1  (HFR1),PHYTOCHROME  RAPIDLY  REGULATED  1  (PAR1)and  PAR2,  and  interact  with  true  transcription  factorproteins  such  as  PIFs,  thus  controlling  transcription
[48,49] .  These  antagonists  prevent  excessive  low  R:FR-induced  elongation  in  shade-avoiding  plants  (Box  1)[49,50] .  Strong  induction  of  these  factors  would  mean  thata  relatively  large  pool  of  PIF  proteins  would  be  kept  frombinding  to  their  target  promoters,  which  would  suppressshade  avoidance.  Indeed,  overexpression  of  PAR1  or  HFR1results  in  reduced  elongation  responses  in  hypocotyls  oflow  R:FR  exposed  Arabidopsis  seedlings  [48].  If  these  SAS-antagonizing  proteins  are  more  strongly  induced  in  shade-tolerant  plants  compared  with  shade  avoiders,  this  wouldindeed  suppress  SAS.  Furthermore,  if  the  induction  wereto  be  organ  speciﬁc,  this  could  explain  why  PIF-mediatedshade  adaptations  in  leaves  are  present  in  shade  species(e.g.,  chloroplast  development  [17,34] )  but  elongation  ofstems  and  petioles  does  not  occur  [19].  Another  known
antagonist  of  the  SAS  is  the  light  labile  PhyA,  whichrepresses  shade-induced  elongation  growth  in  young  seed-lings  under  continuous  far-red  light.  Accordingly,  Arabi-dopsis  phya  mutant  seedlings  show  exaggerated  hypocotylelongation  in  low  R:FR  [51–53] .  If  shade  species  wouldhave  largely  elevated  levels  of  PhyA  protein  this  wouldinhibit  shade-avoidance  responses,  as  has  been  shown  fortransgenic  PhyA  overexpressing  tobacco  plants  [54,55] .Elevated  levels  of  PhyA  signaling  could  be  occurring  inshade  species  through  simple  elevations  in  expression  ofPhyA  and/or  PhyA  signaling  components.  Alternatively,PhyA  could  accumulate  as  a  result  of  slight  alterations  inits  molecule  structure,  which  would  make  it  more  lightstable  in  shade  species.  Such  variation  has  been  shown  to
naturally  occur  in  Arabidopsis  [56].Opinion Trends  in  Plant  Science  February  2013,  Vol.  18,  No.  268
Future  research  to  unravel  the  molecular  networksunderpinning  shade  toleranceUnraveling  the  molecular  regulators  that  determine  if  ashade-avoidance  or  a  shade-tolerance  response  is  initiatedshould  provide  insight  into  how  natural  selection  hasdriven  the  evolution  of  two  fundamentally  different  eco-logical  strategies.  Surveying  natural  variation  in  shaderesponses  in  well-studied  model  systems  such  as  Arabi-dopsis  should  enable  us  to  start  to  identify  variations  in  theearly  shade  responses  of  shade-avoiding  species.  Quanti-fying  such  characteristics  as  hypocotyl  and  petiole  elonga-tion  and  SLA  under  controlled  light  and  shade  conditionsfor  a  broad  range  of  Arabidopsis  accessions,  and  perform-ing  a  genome-wide  association  study  (GWAS)  [57,58] ,should  quickly  lead  to  a  set  of  candidate  genes  that  canbe  further  investigated.  Because  large,  genotyped  popula-
tions  of  this  model  species  already  exist,  researchers  needonly  phenotype  the  population  to  quickly  determine  a  set  ofcandidate  genes.  There  is  extensive  variation  in  theArabidopsis  petiole  angle  and  hypocotyl  elongationresponses  to  shade  stress  ([59,60] ,  K.R.  St  Onge  et  al.,unpublished),  which  makes  this  a  promising  approach.Furthermore,  the  wide  availability  of  mutants  and  simpleprotocols  for  transformation  make  Arabidopsis  the  bestsystem  for  functional  characterization  of  candidate  genes.Despite  the  wealth  of  genomic  and  genetic  tools  availablein  Arabidopsis ,  the  major  drawback  of  using  Arabidopsis  instudies  of  shade  tolerance  is  that  it  does  not  naturally  occurin  forest  understories  and  cannot  truly  be  considered  ashade-tolerant  species  despite  the  lack  of  or  repression  ofSAS  in  some  accessions.  The  underlying  molecular  variation
giving  rise  to  the  loss  of  shade-avoidance  phenotypes  inArabidopsis  likely  affects  genes,  which  are  also  importantfor  shade-avoidance  suppression  in  shade-tolerant  species.Although  suppression  of  SAS  is  only  part  of  the  shade-tolerance  network  such  an  approach  using  Arabidopsis  willprovide  a  starting  point  to  work  from  in  non-model  shade-tolerance  specialists.  Therefore,  although  we  expect  aGWAS  approach  in  Arabidopsis  to  give  us  insight  into  themolecular  mechanisms  of  SAS  repression  and  into  the  con-trol  of  shade  responses  that  are  ubiquitous  to  both  shade-tolerant  and  shade-avoiding  species,  a  comparative  ap-proach  using  shade-avoiding  and  shade-tolerant  specieshas  the  potential  to  unravel  additional,  novel  regulatorsof  shade  tolerance  (see  Figure  I  in  Box  1).To  investigate  shade  tolerance  fully,  we  will  need  to
venture  outside  our  genetic  models.  A  between  speciesapproach  investigating  pairs  of  closely  related  non-modelshade  and  non-shade  species  would  provide  a  good  com-parative  framework.  Next-generation  sequencing  techni-ques  now  make  it  possible  to  explore  the  genomes  of  non-model  organisms  [61,62] .  RNAseq  allows  transcriptomestudies  in  any  species  without  ﬁrst  compiling  a  probeset.  Such  analysis  on  pairs  of  shade  and  non-shade  speciescould  provide  information  on  the  differentially  regulatedpathways  upon  exposure  to  light  quantity  and  qualitychanges.  A  potential  problem  is  that  the  selected  speciesto  be  compared  may  differ  in  many  aspects  of  their  regula-tory  systems,  which  would  make  it  difﬁcult  to  attributespeciﬁc  differences  to  the  variation  in  shade  responses.
Choosing  closely  related  species  (ideally  sister  species)  thatdiffer  only  in  their  shade  response,  and  carefully  designing
Choosing  closely  related  species  (ideally  sister  species)  thatdiffer  only  in  their  shade  response,  and  carefully  designingthe  experimental  conditions,  should  minimize  this.  If  thesesister  species  could  be  crossed,  quantitative  trait  loci  (QTL)mapping  could  be  used  to  ﬁnd  the  genomic  regions  thatunderlie  the  difference  between  the  shade-avoidanceresponse  and  the  shade-tolerance  response.  An  inspiringexample  of  such  a  comparative  approach  comes  from  theresearch  ﬁeld  of  plant  adaptation  to  submergence  stress  andcomparisons  between  Rumex  palustris  and  Rumex  acetosa[63,64] .  Comparisons  of  submergence  responses  betweenthese  two  sister  species  found  that  differential  regulationof  ABA  in  response  to  ethylene  accumulation  (the  primarysubmergence  signal)  was  responsible  for  the  adoption  of  theescape  strategy  in  R.  palustris  and  the  quiescent  strategy  in
R.  acetosa  [65,66] .  Further  research  found  that  naturalvariation  in  the  escape  response  among  R.  palustris  popula-tions  is  associated  with  variation  in  ethylene-mediatedinhibition  of  ABA  levels  [67],  hinting  at  evolutionary  selec-tion  on  this  signal  transduction  event.  In  parallel,  compara-tive  approaches  using  differing  cultivars  within  the  modelspecies  rice  has  identiﬁed  molecular  regulators  of  both  theavoidance  [68]  and  tolerance  [69]  strategy,  all  being  mem-bers  of  the  Ethylene  Responsive  Factor  (ERF)  family  oftranscription  factors.  Another  elegant  example  is  two  stud-ies  which  use  the  self-incompatible  Capsella  grandiﬂora  andits  selﬁng  sister  species  Capsella  rubella  to  identify  thegenetic  architecture  of  the  selﬁng  syndrome  [70,71] .  Selﬁnglineages  have  evolved  from  outcrossing  species  many  timesin  the  history  of  angiosperm  evolution,  and  this  change  is
usually  accompanied  by  a  suite  of  changes  to  ﬂower  mor-phology  and  function,  known  as  the  selﬁng  syndrome.  Per-forming  QTL  mapping  in  F2  populations  [71]  andrecombinant  inbred  lines  [70]  from  interspeciﬁc  crosses,these  studies  identiﬁed  genetic  loci  that  underpin  the  selﬁngsyndrome  and  selﬁng  efﬁciency.We  argue  that  such  combined  approaches  using  bothmodel  and  wild  species  is  essential  for  unraveling  themolecular  mechanisms  and  regulatory  pathways  leadingto  shade  tolerance.  Using  wild  species  is  unavoidablebecause  our  current  model  species  lack  true  adaptationto  shade;  however,  models  can  still  be  helpful  for  ﬁndingleads  and  later  for  functional  characterization.  Combiningthe  results  from  both  approaches  should  lead  to  a  generalpicture  of  how  shade  tolerance  is  achieved  at  the  molecularlevel.  These  anticipated  molecular  insights  should  not  only
help  us  to  understand  the  mechanisms  of  different  ecologi-cal  plant  strategies  but  could  also  foster  crop  improvement,for  example,  suppression  of  shade-avoidance  traits  andoptimization  of  growth  under  suboptimal  light  conditions.AcknowledgmentsFunding  was  received  from  The  Netherlands  organization  for  scientiﬁcresearch  (NWO):  Grant  nr.  818.01.003  to  R.P.,  Ecogenomics  grant  nr.844.10.004  to  L.A.C.J.V.,  and  K.R.St.O.;  and  in  collaboration  with  thegraduate  school  Experimental  Plant  Sciences  (EPS),  Talent  programgrant  nr.  022.001.018  to  C.M.M.G.References1  Franklin,  K.A.
