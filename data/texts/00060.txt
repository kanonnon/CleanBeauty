Such intercellular cross ‐talk results in changes in multiple cellular and
biological functions in recipient cells. Several hallmarks of cancer have reportedlybeen impacted by this exosome ‐mediated cell ‐to‐cell communication, includingmodulating immune responses, reprogramming stromal cells, remodeling thearchitecture of the extracellular matrix, or even endowing cancer cells with char-acteristics of drug resistance. Selectively, loading specific oncogenic moleculesinto exosomes highlights exosomes as potential diagnostic biomarkers as well astherapeutic targets. In addition, exosome ‐based drug delivery strategies in preclin-ical and clinical trials have been shown to dramatically decrease cancer develop-ment. In the present review, we summarize the significant aspects of exosomesin cancer development that can provide novel strategies for potential clinicalapplications.KEYWORDSbiomarker, cancer malignancy, cancer therapy, drug resistance, exosome1|INTRODUCTIONExosomes are nanosized vesicles that are actively secreted by almost
all types of cells, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, epithelialcells, neuronal cells, immune cells, as well as cancer cells.1Enrichedwith many bioactive molecules, such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids,and metabolites, exosomes are endowed with the ability to relay sig-nals between cells.2Indeed, exosomes have been investigated inmany types of body fluid, such as bile, blood, breast milk, urine,cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva, suggesting that exosomes play multi-ple roles in regulating physiological responses.3Recently, the patho-physiological effects of exosomes on diseases, especially cancers,have emerged. Tumor ‐derived exosomes have reportedly beeninvolved in the development of cancer malignancy by promotingcancer proliferation, establishing a premetastatic niche, and regulat-ing drug resistance.2Clinically, exosomes functioning as diagnostic
2Clinically, exosomes functioning as diagnosticbiomarkers, therapeutic targets, or even as anticancer drug ‐deliveryvehicles have all been emphasized as a result of their unique biologi-cal and pathophysiological characteristics.4Here, we provide a com-prehensive overview of exosomes in cell biology of cancer anddiscuss how exosome ‐based intercellular communications regulatecancer progression and metastasis. Additionally, we summarize therole of exosomes in clinical applications in relation to their molecularand biological characteristics.2|EXOSOMESSince platelet ‐derived vesicles with coagulant properties were firstinvestigated by Peter Wolf in 1967,5additional roles of extracellularvesicles (EV) were gradually discovered in the following years.

multivesicular bodies (MVB) and the plasma membrane that directsthe recycling of transferrin receptors during reticulocyte maturation.In 1996, exosomes derived from B lymphocytes were found to showantigen ‐presenting properties, enabling the induction of T ‐cellresponses.8Similarly, antigen ‐presenting exosomes from dendriticcells were also found to suppress cancer progression.9Aside fromparticipating in the immune system, comprehensive functions in vari-ous pathophysiological processes highlight the importance of exo-somes in regulating cancer development and neurodegenerativediseases.22.1 |Characteristics of exosomesExosomes are nanoscaled extracellular vesicles (in general, their sizesrange from 30 to 150 nm) released by almost all cell types.2,4Withinthe endosomal network, the biogenesis of exosomes is generated asintraluminal vesicles (ILV, also called pre ‐exosomes) by inward bud-ding of the multivesicular body membrane.2Mechanisms of exosome
biogenesis are highly regulated through several distinct pathways,1including ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for trans-port) ‐dependent and ESCRT ‐independent pathways (Figure 1). In theFIGURE 1 Biogenesis of exosomes. First, endocytosis could be mediated by either a clathrin ‐dependent pathway or a clathrin ‐independentpathway, which often actively occurs at the lipid raft containing a variety of tumor ‐specific receptors and signaling proteins (eg, growth factorreceptors, oncoproteins) in addition to common membrane proteins, such as tetraspanins (eg, CD9, CD63, CD81), MHC I and II, and adhesionmolecules (eg, integrins, cadherins). Using the endosomal network, the biogenesis of exosomes is achieved in an endosomal sorting complexesrequired for transport (ESCRT) ‐dependent or ESCRT ‐independent method. Accordingly, intraluminal vesicles (exosomes) show inward budding
of the multivesicular bodies (MVB). Indeed, numerous cytoplasmic (eg, ubiquitin ‐related proteins, heat shock proteins, microRNAs [miRNAs],mRNAs, cytoskeleton proteins etc.) and nuclear molecules (eg, transcriptional factors, longnoncoding RNAs [lncRNAs], DNAs etc.) can beselectively loaded into MVB in a cancer type ‐specific and /or stage ‐specific way. Furthermore, multivesicular bodies are fused with the plasmamembrane, leading to the release of exosomes toward the extracellular space in an exocytic way. Several Rab GTPases, including Rab11 /35,Rab7, and Rab27, have been reported to be involved in exosome secretion. Finally, tumor ‐derived exosomes are transferred to the local tumormicroenvironment and distinct organs to regulate tumorigenesis or metastasis, respectively. rER, rough endoplasmic reticulum; sER, smoothendoplasmic reticulumTAI ET AL. |2365

ESCRT membrane ‐scission machinery, 4 multiprotein subcomplexes(ESCRT ‐0, ESCRT ‐I, ESCRT ‐II, and ESCRT ‐III) are required for exo-some biogenesis. Early ESCRT complexes (ESCRT ‐0, ESCRT ‐I, andESCRT ‐III) recognize ubiquitinated cargo by their ubiquitin ‐bindingsubunits, leading to the formation of stable protein complexes withinthe cytoplasm. The ESCRT ‐III complex then transiently assembles onendosomes and conducts the vesicle scission.10Recently, some auxil-iary components, including ATPase, vacuolar protein sorting ‐asso-ciated protein (VPS4), or ALG ‐2‐interacting protein X (ALIX), havebeen indicated to participate in the regulation of ESCRT membrane ‐scission machinery.10In contrast, the budding or release ofexosomes is regulated by lipids, such as sphingolipid ceramide11orsphingosine 1 ‐phosphate within the ESCRT ‐independent pathway.12Molecular constituents, such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids,and metabolites, of exosomes vary depending upon their cells of
origin, environmental conditions, developmental stages, epigeneticchanges, and mechanisms of biogenesis. Various RNA species,including mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), rRNAs, transfer RNAs(tRNAs), or long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), were also identifiedin exosomes,13leading to knowledge of epigenetic modificationbetween cells and changes in biological activities and functions.Recently, dsDNAs appearing in tumor ‐derived exosomes wereshown to reflect the mutational status of parental cancers.14Con-sistently, >10 kb fragments of cellular genomic DNA were foundto bear mutations on oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes intumor ‐derived exosomes.15Moreover, exosomes contain a varietyof bioactive proteins originating from the plasma membrane, cyto-plasm and, in most, but not all, parental cells. Specific proteins,such as ALIX, ESCRT complexes, or Rab GTPases, involved in thebiogenesis of exosomes are conserved and enriched within these
nanosized vesicles.10Other proteins, such as heat shock proteins(eg, HSP70 or HSP 90), tetraspanins (eg, CD9, CD63, and CD81),or integrins, are selectively packaged into exosomes to take partin intracellular assembly or exosome trafficking.2Exosomal proteinprofiles can reflect the enriched protein expression patterns aswell as pathophysiological activities of parental cells. Since activelyemanating from lipid rafts, the membrane composition of exo-somes is relatively abundant in specific lipid species, includingcholesterol, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, diacylglycerol, andceramide, compared to their parent cells.16Some lipids and lipid ‐metabolizing enzymes, such as neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase)or phospholipase D2 (PLD2), regulate the formation and release ofexosomes.11The heterogeneity of exosomes in association with exosome ‐mediated cell functions, distinct molecular cargo profiles, and theresultant biophysical characteristics have been investigated accord-
ing to their distinct morphology and /or sizes. The latter has beenused to discriminate large exosome vesicles (90 ‐120 nm), smallexosome vesicles (60 ‐80 nm), or nonmembranous nanoparticles(also called exomeres, ~35 nm).17Intrinsically, distinct molecularsignatures in exomeres and exosomes were further seen in pro-teomic, lipidomic, and glycomic analyses. Based on proteomic pro-filing, enzymes related to metabolism and hypoxia as well asmicrotubule and coagulation proteins are more abundantlyexpressed in exomeres compared to large or small membranousexosomal vesicles. In contrast, large and small exosome vesiclesshow enrichment in mitotic spindle and interleukin (IL) ‐2/STAT5signaling, and proteins related to endosomal secretion, respec-tively.17Moreover, the difference in sialylated glycoproteins (ie,galectin ‐3‐binding protein) between exosomes and exomeres isorgan distribution.17Consistent with the variations in lipid compo-
sitions between exomeres and exosomes,17density gradient cen-
galectin ‐3‐binding protein) between exosomes and exomeres isorgan distribution.17Consistent with the variations in lipid compo-sitions between exomeres and exosomes,17density gradient cen-trifugation showed that isolated exosomes are separated into 2distinct populations: lower density exosomes (LD ‐Exo) and higherdensity exosomes (HD ‐Exo).18Intriguingly, LD ‐Exo ‐treated endothe-lial cells showed an upregulation of solute carrier family 38 mem-ber 1 (SLC38A1) compared to HD ‐Exo ‐treated endothelial cells.18Together, these studies suggested that distinct exosome subpopu-lations with unique compositions trigger diverse biological effectson recipient cells.2.2 |Exosomes in cell ‐to‐cell communicationCell ‐to‐cell communication is critical in maintaining physiologicalhomeostasis and directs pathological manifestations. Rather thandirect cell ‐cell contact or the release and uptake of extracellular sig-naling molecules, such as cytokines, growth factors, hormones, and
extracellular matrix, exosomes are emerging as critical mediators ininter ‐and intracellular communications both locally and distantly.4Enclosed by the lipid bilayer ‐membrane, exosomes provide a pro-tective shield for vulnerable biological molecules. Indeed, the exoso-mal membrane structure encapsulates and protects miRNAs orproteins from degradation by RNases19or by proteinase,20respec-tively. Several studies have indicated that biological activity of exo-somal molecules authentically modulates cell signaling events andbiological processes of the recipient cells.21During cancer develop-ment, tumor ‐derived microvesicles (also called oncosomes) are cap-able of transmitting the oncogenic receptor EGFR vIII fromaggressive brain cancer cells to another cancer cell lacking this onco-genic receptor activity.22In addition, lncRNAs are exchangedbetween gastric cancer cells through exosomes, triggering cancerprogression.23Exosome ‐mediated cell ‐cell communication is not lim-
ited to cancer cells, rather it has also been shown within the tumormicroenvironment locally and distantly.24Tumor ‐derived exosomescan transport transforming growth factor beta (TGF ‐β) from cancersto normal fibroblasts, subsequently driving fibroblast into myofibrob-last differentiation.25In contrast, cancer ‐associated fibroblast (CAF) ‐derived exosomes modulate the metabolism of cancer cells byinhibiting the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation process incancer cells.26Regarding the role of exosomes on long distancetransfer of biological molecules between cells, malignant cancer cells,such as breast or pancreatic cancers, secrete exosomes containingbioactive molecules, such as telomerase activity27or macrophagemigration inhibitory factor,28to the distant tumor ‐associatedmicroenvironment and contribute to the formation of premetastaticniches.2366 | TAI ET AL.

3|EXOSOMES IN CANCER MALIGNANCYExosome ‐mediated cell ‐cell communication is required in remod-eling tumor microenvironments and forming premetastatic nichesduring cancer development (Figure 2). Bioactive molecules ofexosomes derived from cancer cel ls or stromal cells provide theessential signals for reprogramming of various cells and architec-tures in tumor microenvironments or premetastatic niches(Table 1).3.1 |Tumor ‐derived exosomes in cancerprogressionCancer progression is a dynamic and multistep process in which sev-eral well ‐studied signaling events aid in orchestrating the develop-ment of cancer malignancy. Tumor ‐derived exosomes have beenindicated to actively regulate cancer progression by inducingautocrine /paracrine oncogenesis, reprogramming stromal cells, modu-lating the immune system, while also promoting angiogenesis.24Transfer of oncogenic molecules within oncosomes between pri-mary tumor results in morphological transformation and an increase
in anchorage ‐independent growth in recipient cancer cells.22Like-wise, tumor ‐derived exosomes exert antiapoptotic effects of TGF ‐β1signaling in an autocrine way, which subsequently renders the pro-motion of cancer proliferation.33ZFAS1 lncRNA enclosed withinexosomes is transferred from malignant cancers to ZFAS1 ‐negativecancer subpopulations to enhance the proliferation of ZFAS1 ‐nega-tive cancer subpopulations.23Through this advantageous paracrineroute, some metabolites, such as intermediates of the tricarboxylicacid (TCA) cycle, are often packaged into CAF ‐derived exosomes andare transferred from CAF to cancer cells.26Subsequently, metaboliccargoes carried within exosomes enable glycolysis modulation andglutamine ‐dependent reductive carboxylation in cancers, contributingto cancer growth.26Reciprocally, tumor ‐derived exosomes regulate
FIGURE 2 Summary of tumor ‐derived exosome ‐mediated functions. Tumor ‐derived exosomes regulate the autocrine /paracrine induction ofcancers, activation of angiogenesis, modulation of the immune system, re ‐education of stromal cells, organotropic metastasis, and remodelingthe extracellular matrix, contributing to cancer progression and metastasis. For example, tumor ‐derived exosomes transfer epidermal growthfactor receptor (eEGFR) vIII oncogenic receptor or ZFAS1 lncRNA from aggressive cancers to nonaggressive cancers, inducing cancerprogression. Also, tumor ‐derived exosomes that show tetraspanins or microRNA (miRNA) clusters induce endothelial migration and tubeformation. Furthermore, tumor ‐derived exosomes containing miRNAs, such as miR ‐222 ‐3p, induce polarization of M2 macrophages.Additionally, tumor ‐derived exosomes deliver miRNA, such as miR ‐9, miR ‐105, and miR ‐181c, from cancers to normal fibroblasts or vascular
endothelial barriers, subsequently enhancing cancer malignancy. Moreover, integrins direct tumor ‐derived exosomes to specific distinct targetorgans, leading to metastatic organotropism. By delivery of extracellular matrix remodeling enzymes, tumor ‐derived exosomes contribute tocancer metastasisTAI ET AL. |2367 13497006, 2018, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cas.13697 by Cochrane Japan, Wiley Online Library on [26/09/2024].

endothelial angiogenic responses by promoting the formation ofendothelial tubule networks, which could lead to cancer malig-nancy.43Tumor exosomes direct stromal cell reprogramming and can alsoserve as a critical event driving cancer progression. In this regard,tumor ‐derived exosomes deliver miRNA, such as miR ‐9, that givesrise to the differentiation of fibroblasts into CAF with higher cellmotility.36Moreover, miR ‐9 is also released from the CAF toenhance cancer progression.36Tumor ‐derived exosomes also triggerdifferentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) into myofibroblaststhat show pro ‐angiogenic and pro ‐invasive characteristics.32The dif-ferentiated MSC then further promote cancer proliferation and inva-sion by secreting growth factors and matrix ‐regulating factors.32Cancer cells require adequate oxygen and nutrients for growthand development. Tumor ‐induced angiogenesis supplies necessaryoxygen and nutrients, while also serving to remove waste materials.
Surface tetraspanins on tumor ‐released exosomes, such as Tspan8,can remotely activate resting endothelial cells, sprouting of endothe-lial cells and maturation of endothelial cell progenitors by upregula-tion of angiogenesis ‐related genes.34In addition, tumor ‐derivedexosomes bearing miRNA clusters, such as miR ‐17‐92 cluster, induceendothelial migration and tube formation.37Furthermore, neovascu-larization is observed as a result of increases in the expression ofvascular cell adhesion molecule ‐1 (VCAM ‐1) and intercellular adhe-sion molecule ‐1 (ICAM ‐1) that were prominently found in endothelialcells treated with tumor ‐derived exosomes.44Endothelial cells re ‐educated by tumor ‐derived exosomes show enhanced cell motilityand tube formation ability.44Accumulating evidence supports the involvement of exosomes inmediating communication between cancer cells and immune cells,such as macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic
cells, and T cells. Indeed, tumor ‐derived exosomes also regulate thepolarization of macrophages. For example, macrophages that haveacquired miR ‐222 ‐3p within exosomes are capable of inducing polar-ization toward tumor ‐promoting M2 macrophages in a SOCS3 /STAT3 signal ‐dependent way.42Additionally, tumor ‐derived exo-somes facilitate tumorigenesis and cancer progression by enhancingdifferentiation of bone marrow ‐derived neutrophils and recruitmentof neutrophils to cancer cells.45Clinically, exosomes collected fromliquid biopsies of patients with acute myelogenous leukemiadecreased the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells attributed to anincrease in Smad phosphorylation and a decrease in NKG2Dreceptor expression.46This study suggests that tumor ‐derived exo-somes facilitate cancer progression by attenuating immuneresponses.46Furthermore, tumor ‐derived microvesicles affect thefunctions of myeloid cells by ablating monocyte differentiation into
dendritic cells, which subsequently suppresses the activity of T ‐cellproliferation and anticancer cytolytic functions.473.2 |Tumor ‐derived exosomes in cancer metastasisMetastasis is the most common cause of cancer ‐related death. Mul-tistep processes are required for cancer metastasis. In 1889, StephenPaget postulated the “seed and soil ”hypothesis, in which metastasisdepends on the interaction between cancer cells (designated as theseed) and specific organ microenvironments (designated as thesoil).48Metastatic cancer cells secrete soluble or vesicle ‐enclosedbioactive molecules that enable remodeling of extracellular matrixarchitecture and reprogramming of contributing cells in distant organsites, such as bone marrow progenitor cells, CAF, tumor ‐associatedmacrophages (TAM), and tumor ‐associated neutrophils, towardestablishing suitable premetastatic niches in advance of cancermetastasis.According to Paget 's“seed and soil ”hypothesis, the nonrandom
macrophages (TAM), and tumor ‐associated neutrophils, towardestablishing suitable premetastatic niches in advance of cancermetastasis.According to Paget 's“seed and soil ”hypothesis, the nonrandompattern of cancer metastasis was further elaborated by Hart andFidler in 198049observing that metastatic colonization was pro-foundly affected by interaction with the tumor microenvironment atspecific target organs. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms oforgan ‐specific metastasis are poorly established. Until recently, a ser-ies of reports from Lyden 's group substantiated that tumor ‐derivedexosomes assist in priming premetastatic niches by activating bonemarrow ‐derived vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1(VEGFR1) +hematopoietic progenitor cells through the exchange ofexosome ‐mediated MET oncoprotein.31Recently, the same groupfurther indicated that integrin expression profiles of tumor ‐derivedexosomes function as “ZIP codes ”to direct exosomes to specific tis-
sues /organs, leading to metastatic organotropism.30In light of pro-teomics and clinical relevance analyses, exosomal integrins α6β4 andα6β1 were positively correlated with lung metastasis, whereas exo-some integrin αvβ5 was highly associated with liver metastasis.30Furthermore, tumor ‐derived exosomes induced the activation of Srcand caused an upregulation of pro ‐inflammatory S100 genes in therecipient cells of target organs, leading to the establishment of pre-metastatic niches.30TABLE 1 (Continued)ExosomalbioactivemoleculesType ofbioactivemolecule Mechanism Functional effect Process Cancer type ReferenceAmino acids,lipids, and TCA ‐cycleintermediatesMetabolites Regulate mitochondrialoxidative phosphorylation,glycolysis, and glutamine ‐dependent reductivecarboxylationDownregulatemitochondrial functionand upregulate glucosemetabolism in cancersIncrease cancergrowthProstate cancer 26

In support of the above studies, several studies have also shownthat tumor ‐derived exosomes deliver extracellular matrix remodelingenzymes such as MMP2 or MMP9, conferring degradation of extra-cellular matrixes and contributing to cancer invasion and metasta-sis.50Similarly, increase in TGF expression of Kupffer cells in theliver is achieved by MIF ‐1 contained within pancreatic cancer ‐derived exosomes, which subsequently leads to an increase in fibro-nectin production by hepatic stellate cells.28This remodeledmicroenvironment then further enhances the recruitment of bonemarrow ‐derived macrophages, which contributes to the formation ofpremetastatic niche in the liver, providing suitable conditions formetastasis.28The pathological relevance of tumor ‐derived exosomes on cancermetastasis is emphasized by their functional effect on the invasivecapability of cancers.51Undoubtedly, invadopodia biogenesis andexosome secretion are concomitantly required for exosome ‐mediated
cancer invasion.52Inhibition of exosome biogenesis or secretion byRab27a knockdown significantly reduced the formation of matureinvadopodia, as well as extracellular matrix digestion.52Interestingly,invadopodia are critical sites for exosome secretion, suggesting thatexosomes regulate invasive activity in a synergistic way.52Further-more, tumor ‐derived exosomes may transfer miRNAs from meta-static cancer cells to less metastatic cells, by which alterations ingene expression could facilitate metastasis within less metastaticcells.41Brain metastasis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality incancer patients. Despite the highly selective permeability of theblood ‐brain barrier (BBB), metastatic cancer cells are still able toinvade the central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies have shownthat exosomes derived from metastatic cancer cells can disrupt thestructure and function of the BBB.39,40miRNAs, such as miR ‐105
and miR ‐181c, within cancer exosomes are taken up by vascularendothelial cells and prompt the destruction of vascular endothelialbarriers through targeting tight junction proteins or inducing abnor-mal localization of the cytoskeleton.39,40As a result, the destroyedvascular endothelial barriers permit cancer metastasis to the brain.3.3 |Stroma ‐derived exosomes in cancerdevelopmentActive communications between stromal cells and cancer cells infacilitating cancer progression can also be achieved by exosome ‐mediated signaling activities. Regardless of how exosomes aresecreted, either constitutively or induced upon signal activation, exo-somes are released from stromal cells continuously to influence thepathogenicity of cancer cells.50Bioactive molecules, such as Notchligands, can be transferred between endothelial cells and cancer cellsin the tumor microenvironment.29Notch ligand Delta ‐like 4 is foundwithin exosomes derived from endothelial cells. They inhibit Notch
signaling in cancer cells or other endothelial cells, leading to themodification of cancers and the tumor microenvironment.29In addi-tion, enormous numbers of exosomes were found to be releasedfrom CAF during chemotherapy.35Presumably, it is believed thatsuch change is to promote survival, proliferation, and drug resistanceof cancer cells, in part as a result of increased expression ofchemoresistance ‐inducing factor, Snail.35Moreover, exosomes fromTAM diminish chemotherapy sensitivity of cancers as a result ofmiR ‐21 activity.38These studies suggested that exosomes derivedfrom tumor microenvironments play an active and essential role inthe regulation of cancer chemo ‐and/or radiation resistance.4|EXOSOMES IN CLINICALAPPLICATIONSExosomes contribute to the pathophysiological development of can-cers by delivering specific bioactive molecules crucial at variousstages of cancer development, suggesting exosomes have the poten-
tial to serve as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The
stages of cancer development, suggesting exosomes have the poten-tial to serve as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Thephenomenon of drug resistance associated with exosomes is emerg-ing in various types of cancers. Therefore, understanding the mecha-nisms of exosome ‐mediated cancer therapeutic resistance shouldprovide valuable information for precision cancer therapies. More-over, exosomes are nonimmunogenic in nature and have been usedas an anticancer drug delivery system, given that their membranecomposition is similar to most of the cells in the body.4.1 |Tumor exosomes as potential biomarkersCancer is actively evolving over time through each mutation andselection process that further promotes its malignancy. Being onceremoved from its parental cells, exosomal cargoes bare strongresemblance to the intracellular status of the original secreted cell.Thus, real ‐time detection of the changes within exosomal cargoes
could provide insightful information for the fundamental prerequisiteof precision medicine in terms of diagnosis, prognosis, and diseasemonitoring (Table 2). For example, early detection of cancer substan-tially improves the odds for successful therapeutic outcome andenhances survival rate; therefore, the unmet need for sensitive andprecise biomarkers is vital. Advantages of identifying tumor markerswithin liquid biopsies are that it is minimally invasive, easily obtained,and rapid and economical relative to tissue biopsies. Moreover, thevast amount of dynamic information readily extracted from a patientis valuable in aiding identification of early detection biomarkers incancer patients. In particular, lipid ‐based exosomes provide a morerobust and enriched vehicle for vulnerable biological molecules in cir-culating fluids, such as serum, plasma, urine, and saliva. The stabilityof biological molecules in exosomes derived from blood plasma is
high (over 90 days) under general storage conditions.56Moreover,the number of exosomes in body fluids is often found to be signifi-cantly higher in patients with disease.56To be noted, despite rapidand easy evaluation of cell ‐free DNAs (cfDNAs) and circulatingtumor cells (CTC) within liquid biopsy, their characteristics in associa-tion with cancer development and progression are questionable andare limited in comparison with tumor exosomes. cfDNAs have beenreported to carry characteristic mutations of the corresponding2370 | TAI ET AL. 13497006, 2018, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cas.13697 by Cochrane Japan, Wiley Online Library on [26/09/2024].

primary cancers, whereas higher circulating tumor DNAs (ctDNAs)clearance processes are commonly observed in liver or kidney, imply-ing a poor understanding of the stability and pathogenicity ofcfDNAs.57Circulating tumor cells are extremely rarely observed inperipheral blood. Thus, to isolate and identify these rare circulatingtumor cells among all other hematopoietic and immune cells is ratherdifficult and an effective isolating and detection approach is urgentlyneeded.58Recently, we found that specific integrin expression profiles oftumor ‐derived exosomes could function as “ZIP codes ”that directorganotropic metastasis.30This is the first bioactive molecule thatpredicts organ ‐specific metastases of cancers, attributing to exoso-mal integrins as biomarkers of organotropic metastatic potential.30Similarly, a specific exosome signature, including tyrosinase ‐relatedprotein ‐2 (TYRP2), very late antigen 4 (VLA ‐4), heat shock protein
70 (HSP70), HSP90 isoform, and MET, was identified to be abun-dantly expressed during the late stage of melanoma, serving as analternative diagnosis of aggressive melanoma using liquid biopsies.31Clinically, exosomes derived from serum samples of patients withglioblastoma bear specific EGFR VIII, reinforcing tumor ‐derived exo-somes as sources of biomarkers reflecting the status of parental can-cer cells.54In addition, specific gene expressions of exosomes inurine are correlated with patients having high ‐grade prostate cancer,which sheds light on the advantages of exosomes in the diagnosisand prognosis of cancer development.55In contrast, androgen recep-tor splice variant 7 RNA expression in exosomes derived frompatients with metastatic prostate cancer highly predicts the develop-ment of endocrine therapy resistance.53Together, these basic andclinical studies imply a potential role of exosomes in diseaseprognostication.4.2 |Tumor exosomes as therapeutic targets
4.2 |Tumor exosomes as therapeutic targetsCargoes of tumor ‐derived exosomes attribute to cancer develop-ment. Thus, alternative therapeutic strategies, such as blockage ofexosome production, secretion, and exosome ‐mediated cell ‐cell com-munication, as well as ablation of specific active exosomal cargos,have been proposed as novel cancer interventions (Table 3). Indeed,inhibition of the ESCRT ‐dependent or the ESCRT ‐independent mech-anism ‐mediated exosome biogenesis, such as syndecan /syntenin /ALIXsignaling60or sphingomyelinases,11respectively, has shown detri-mental effects in exosome production and on cancer progression.Another critical protein significant in exosome secretion, Rab27 smallGTPase, is involved in regulating the docking of multivesicular endo-somes onto the plasma membrane and the size of multivesicularendosomes.61Cancer proliferation and metastasis were hinderedupon inhibiting Rab27a.45An inhibitor of clathrin ‐mediated endocytosis, chlorpromazine,
was shown to impede cancer malignancy in vitro by targeting themechanism of exosome uptake by endocytosis or macropinocyto-sis.62Furthermore, the surface proteins of tumor ‐derived exosomesdisplay specific glycosylation patterns that are involved in the regula-tion of exosome uptake by recipient cells.59Such a finding suggeststhat alteration in the glycosylation of exosomal proteins can bepotent in cancer progression. Recently, a cancer treatment strategyfor extracorporeal hemofiltration of exosomes from the circulationby an affinity plasmapheresis platform has been proposed,63suggest-ing that removal of exosome from the circulatory system providesan additional strategy for therapeutic reagents to block the onco-genic signal on cancers. Together, these studies suggest that variouspotential therapeutic strategies by intercepting biogenesis, secretion,or uptake of tumor ‐derived exosomes are promising means for thedevelopment of anticancer therapies.
development of anticancer therapies.4.3 |Roles of tumor exosomes in drug resistance
or uptake of tumor ‐derived exosomes are promising means for thedevelopment of anticancer therapies.4.3 |Roles of tumor exosomes in drug resistanceDrug resistance in cancer occurs from tumor exosomes through adrug efflux ‐dependent mechanism by pumping chemotherapeuticagents out of cancer cells. Intercellular transfer of exosomal miRNAs /proteins between drug ‐resistant cells and drug ‐sensitive cells leadsto modified gene expression in the drug ‐sensitive cell population.Such change in gene expression endows the sensitive cells with anantiapoptotic ability when met with the drug, an ability that is alsoobserved in drug ‐resistant cells.69Such phenomenon was observedin docetaxel ‐resistant tumors that secrete exosomes containingP‐glycoprotein, a type of drug efflux pump protein. These exosomeswere taken up by drug ‐sensitive cancer cells, and drug resistancewithin these sensitive cells was observed.70Furthermore, exosomes derived from HER2 ‐overexpressing
breast cancers display activated HER2 protein that regulates thedegree of sensitivity to trastuzumab, an anticancer drug. Moreover,activated HER2 protein from exosomes contributes to oncogenic sig-nal‐mediated cancer malignancy.71Other reports have shown thattumor ‐derived exosomes can also protect target cells by transportingTABLE 2 Exosomal bioactive molecules used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in cancerBiomarker Type of biomarker Type of body fluid Analytical approach Expression level Cancer type ReferenceAR‐V7 RNA RNA Plasma PCR Upregulated Prostate cancer 53EGFR vIII mRNA mRNA Serum PCR Upregulated Glioblastoma 54Gene Gene Urine PCR Gene expression Prostate cancer 55Integrins Protein Plasma ELISA Upregulated Breast cancer 30MIF Protein Plasma ELISA Upregulated Pancreatic cancer 28ZFAS1 Long noncoding RNA Serum PCR Upregulated Gastric cancer 23EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor.TAI ET AL. |2371

an abundance of proteins targeted by drugs and neutralizing theeffects of the drug on target cells.72Similarly, cells of the tumormicroenvironment also release exosomes that placate drug resistancein cancer cells. Stroma ‐derived exosomes have been shown to modu-late the sensitivity of chemotherapy and radiation in cancer cells byregulating STAT1 ‐dependent antiviral and NOTCH3 signaling.73Together, these studies highlight varied mechanisms of exosome ‐mediated drug resistance either through pumping anticancer drugsout of cells or transferring bioactive molecules between cells.4.4 |Roles of exosomes in drug deliveryResembling liposomes, naturally secreted exosome vesicles have gar-nered much attention as drug ‐delivery vehicles. First of all, the nano-metric ‐sized exosomes can be easily transferred between cells.Second, the lipid bilayer ‐membrane structure of exosomes confers aprotected environment for bioactive molecules from degradation in
the extracellular milieu.3Third, exosomes show lower immunogenic-ity and toxicity than other drug ‐delivery strategies.74Last, exosomesbearing specific surface proteins, such as integrins, can direct them-selves to specific organs.30These features of exosomes implicatethat exosomes can be efficient drug ‐delivery vesicles for the deliveryof anticancer agents, siRNAs, or proteins (Table 3). Interestingly, exo-somes transfer anticancer drugs through the BBB, leading to cyto-toxic effects in Danio rerio brain cancers.64Prevalently, exosomesloaded with anticancer drug derived from autologous cancers can betaken up by parental cancer cells through endocytosis, leading toincreased cytotoxicity in parental cancer cells.65In terms of targetingspecificity, αv integrin ‐specific RGD (Arg ‐Gly‐Asp) peptide was fusedon exosomes loaded with anticancer drug (ie, doxorubicin) to signifi-cantly improve exosome uptake by αv integrin ‐positive cancer cells,
leading to inhibition of cancer growth.66Intrinsically, exosomes have been recognized as novel cell ‐freevaccines in immunotherapy.9Cancer antigens loaded into exosomesderived from autologous dendritic cells facilitate anticancer immuneresponses (ie, induced natural killer, NK, cell effector functions) inpatients with advanced non ‐small ‐cell lung cancer.67Further studyused exosomes from interferon ‐γ‐mature dendritic cells to accelerateanticancer immune responses in both NK and T cells.68Increase inNK cell activity and longer progression ‐free survival rate wereobserved in patients with advanced non ‐small ‐cell lung cancer.68Together, these studies suggested that exosomes function as poten-tial drug ‐delivery vehicles or cell ‐free vaccines in anticancer therapies.5|CONCLUSIONNormal cell homeostasis relies upon the exchange of biological materi-als across the membranes and such transport is facilitated through
vesicles that compartmentalize cargo to its appropriate destination.Exosomes are these vesicles that function as mediators of intercellularcommunication. They are ubiquitously discharged into the extracellularmilieu and have unique features depending upon the secreted cell oforigin. Past studies have suggested that, in an aberrant state, like can-cer, exosomal protein withholds cargoes that disclose informationregarding the state of the secreting cell, while also providing insightsto the progression of the recipient cell. Exosome ‐mediated cell ‐to‐cellcommunication has emerged as an indispensible regulatory process incancer tumorigenesis and metastasis, as well as in chemotherapeuticresistance. Exosomes assist in the process of organotropic metastasis,and additional critical oncogenic signals also take part in reconcilingthe selectivity and functionality of exosome cargoes involved in organ-otropic metastasis. As a result of the complex regulatory mechanisms
and cross ‐talk mediated by exosomes between cancer cells and stro-
otropic metastasis. As a result of the complex regulatory mechanismsand cross ‐talk mediated by exosomes between cancer cells and stro-mal cells, details of these processes require further investigation. Inaddition, the origin and biological significance of heterogeneity in exo-somes remain largely unknown because of a lack of analytical plat-forms and available technologies. At last, we can appreciate thereciprocal interaction of exosomes between cancer cells and stromalTABLE 3 Candidate mechanisms of cancer therapy by targeting /using exosomeCandidatemechanisms Treatment approach Status ReferenceAblate exosomalcargoAlternate exosomalglycosylationIn vitro 59Block exosomeproductionInhibit syndecan /syntenin /ALIX signalIn vitro 60Block exosomeproductionInhibit sphingomyelinase In vitro 11Block exosomesecretionInhibit Rab27 smallGTPaseIn vitro 61Block exosome ‐mediated cell ‐cellcommunicationInhibit endocytosis andmacropinocytosisIn vitro 62Block oncogenic
