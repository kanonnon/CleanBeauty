W e have investigated the e¡ect of orallyadministered lutein and zeaxanthin in the cutaneous re-sponse to ultraviolet B irradiation. Female hairless SKh-
1 mice receiving 0.4% and 0.04% lutein plus zeaxanthin-enriched diet for 2 wk were exposed to single doses ofultraviolet B radiation. Skin biopsies were taken at 24and 48 h after irradiation and analyzed for the presenceof apoptotic cells, proliferating cells, and expression ofproliferating cell nuclear antigen. Our results show aclear ultraviolet-induced dose-dependent in£ammatoryresponse. Orally administered 0.4% lutein and zeax-anthin decreased signi¢cantly the edematous cutaneousresponse (p o0.01) as determined by the reduction of theUVB-induced increase of ear bifold thickening. Addi-tionally, dietary carotenoids were e⁄cient in reducingthe ultraviolet B-induced increases in the percentage ofproliferating cell nuclear antigen (p o0.05), bromodeox-yuridine (p o0.05), and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nickend-labeling-positive cells (p o0.01). These data demon-
strate that oral supplementation of lutein and zeax-anthin diminishes the e¡ects of ultraviolet B irradia-tion by reducing acute in£ammatory responses and ul-traviolet-induced hyperproliferative rebound.

J Invest Dermatol 121:399 ^405 , 2003The acute responses of human skin to solar ultraviolet(UV) radiation ( l, 290^400 nm) are recognized as aform of in£ammatory reaction that are mediated byseveral possible mechanisms, including: (1) a directaction of absorbed photons on DNA of viable nucleiof skin cells (Cadet and Vigny , 1990; Cadet et al, 1992;Tedesco et al,1997); (2) the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) andfree radicals (e.g., superoxide anion (O2^), singlet oxygen (1O2),hydroxy (OH), or peroxy radicals (OOH)) (Pathak and Stratton,1968; Athar et al, 1992; Dalle Carbonare and Pathak, 1992); and (3)the generation of prostaglandins (PGD 2,P G E 2), histamines, leu-
kotrienes, and other cytokines (Black et al, 1980; Hawk et al,1 9 8 3 ;Pentland and Needleman, 1986; Kupper, 1990; Soter, 1990; Norriset al, 1993; Tedesco et al, 1997). It is conceivable that these UV-in-duced reactions represent oxidative stress reactions of DNA bases,lipids, and proteins mediated by the formation of free radicalsand ROS, liberation of membrane phospholipids, membrane li-pid peroxidation, and subsequent formation of prostaglandins aswell as other cytokines by cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-mediated pathways (Black et al, 1980; Hawk et al, 1983; Pentlandand Needleman, 1986; Pentland and Jacobs, 1991).Several studies have been reported to indicate that a number ofUV-mediated cutaneous in£ammatory reactions (e.g., sunburn,skin phototoxic reaction involving drug-induced photosensitiza-tion, epidermal edema, and vesicle formation) can be partially in-hibited or minimized by systemic administration of antioxidants,
such as vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin E ( a-tocopherol), b-carotene, polyphenolic antioxidants and iso£avones, and othercompounds (Mathews-Roth et al, 1970, 1972; Greenberg et al,
such as vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin E ( a-tocopherol), b-carotene, polyphenolic antioxidants and iso£avones, and othercompounds (Mathews-Roth et al, 1970, 1972; Greenberg et al,1990; Gerrish and Gensler, 1993; Wang et al, 1994; Darr and Pin-nell, 1997). Although this search has recently widened to includecosmetic bene¢ts, nutraceutical and therapeutic interventions(e.g., in skin photoaging, skin carcinogenesis), only a few com-pounds of antioxidant nature (e.g., polyphenolic antioxidants si-lymarin from milk thistle, epigallocatechin-3-gallate from greentea, and iso£avone) appear to be promising in the chemopreven-tion of UV-induced skin damage (Wang et al, 1994, 1998; Wei,1998; Lahiri-Chatterjee et al, 1999).In recent years, our interest has broadened for minimizing orpreventing the acute and chronic reactions of skin to UV radia-tion using hitherto poorly recognized antioxidants of plantorigin such as lutein and zeaxanthin to prevent or minimize
the harmful e¡ects of UV radiation involving ROS.

patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria and healthy indivi-duals (Mathews-Roth et al, 1970, 1972), its use has been shown tobe of limited success in UV-induced in£ammation (Darr andPinnell, 1997). Lutein, a major xanthophyll carotenoid, is structu-rally related to b-carotene and appears to have superior antioxi-dant properties compared with b-carotene (O’Connor andO’Brien, 1998). Lutein and zeaxanthin are found in high concen-trations in several fruits and green-leafed vegetables, such as broc-coli, spinach, kale, cabbage, and green mustard leaves, etc.Additionally , these xanthophyll carotenoids have been identi¢edto accumulate in human skin (Wingerath et al,1 9 9 8 ) .In this communication, we report a potentially bene¢cialin-vivo property of this naturally occurring antioxidant agent inphotoprotection of murine skin against harmful e¡ects of UVBradiation. These photoprotective e¡ects include: inhibition ofUVB-induced acute in£ammatory responses, decreased number
of UVB-induced apoptotic sunburn cells, reduction in UV-in-duced hyperproliferative response as shown by decreased numberof proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and bromodeoxyur-idine (BrdU)-positive cells in the epidermis of lutein and zeax-anthin fed mice. Because UV-induced in£ammation andhyperproliferation (Black et al, 1980; Hawk et al, 1983; Pentlandand Needleman, 1986; Pentland and Jacobs, 1991) have beenstrongly involved in UVB carcinogenesis, inhibitory e¡ects ofdietary lutein and zeaxanthin on acute in£ammation and epider-mal hyperproliferation may have a potential implication for theprevention of carcinogenesis in chronically irradiated skin.MATERIALS AND METHODSMice and diets Twenty-¢ve female SKH-1 mice, 6 to 8 wk of age, werepurchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, Massachusetts).Mice were housed in our animal housing facility under controlled
temperature and humidity , and alternating 12 h light and dark cycles for aperiod of 2 wk before use. Mice received drinking water ad libitum . Theywere housed into groups of four animals per cage and put into threedi¡erent groups according to the diet administered. Mice of group I(n¼9) were fed with the standard diet of Purina Rodent Chow 5001;mice of group II (n ¼8) were fed with Purina Rodent Chow 5001enriched with 0.04% lutein and zeaxanthin and mice of group III (n ¼8)received Purina Rodent Chow 5001 enriched with 0.4% lutein andzeaxanthin. Crystalline FloraGLO brand lutein was provided in a stableform by Kemin Foods, L.C. (DesMoines, Iowa). This material containslutein and zeaxanthin in a ratio of approximately 20:1. FloraGLO brandlutein is a puri¢ed source of lutein and zeaxanthin, which ismanufactured and sold commercially according to a patented process. (US
patent no. 5382 714) and is the only pure product available for oralsupplementation, and was used in our studies without further separation.The diets were prepared by Research Diets Inc. (New Brunswick, NewJersey) and packed under vacuum in evacuated and sealed plastic bags,each containing 100 g of diet in pellet form. The dietary bags enrichedwith 0.4% and 0.04% lutein and zeaxanthin were refrigerated at 4 1Ct opreserve the carotenoids. These concentrations were recommended bynutritional experts (Professor Curran-Celentano, personal communication).Mice were fed on alternate days for a total of 14 d prior to UVB exposure.The study aimed to evaluate the photo protective e¡ects of dietary luteinsupplementation was approved by our Institutional Animal Care and EthicCommittee and carried out in observance of the NIH Guidelines for the careand use of laboratoryAnimals.UVB exposure Mice were irradiated using a Spot Light Source

UVB exposure Mice were irradiated using a Spot Light SourceRadiation (Model L2859-07, Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., Japan),equipped with a cut-o¡ ¢lter at 295 nm. UV radiation was deliveredthrough a bundle of quartz optical ¢bers with a spot size of 1 cm indiameter. The emitted UVB radiation was measured with aspectroradiometer (model 742, Optronic Laboratories Inc., Orlando,Florida). The spectral output of this lamp was maximal at 310 nm withthe majority of the UVB energy emitted below 320 nm. The ¢ltered UVradiation was calibrated and measured with the aid of an IL1700 researchradiometer equipped with an SED 240 UVB detector probe(International Light, Newburyport, Massachusetts).Two weeks before UVB exposure, all mice were tattooed on lateral skinof the dorsum surface for carefully locating the irradiation exposure sitesand for obtaining skin biopsies of the exposed skin sites. The mice werethen exposed at duplicate sites to single doses of 40, 80, and 160 mJ percm
2of UVB radiation at the previously marked skin areas of the dorsalsurface. Of note, 1 minimum erythema dose for skin phototype III isabout 30 mJ per cm2.Skin edema To assess the e¡ect of p.o. administered lutein andzeaxanthin on UVB-induced skin in£ammation and edema, ears of micewere exposed to 40 and 160 mJ per cm2of UVB radiation and the increasesin skin-bifold thickness of the irradiated ears were measured at 24 h in ablinded manner. In doing this, the ear skin double fold thickness wasdetermined using a Vernier Caliper micrometer (Scienceware,Switzerland). The increase in ear-bifold thickness of ears was calculated bysubtracting the baseline values obtained prior to UV exposure.Isolation of skin samples From each experimental group, half of theexperimental animals receiving UVB radiation were killed at 24 h and theremaining were killed at 48 h after UVB irradiation using IACUC(Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) approved techniques of
euthanasia. In each animal, 6 mm skin biopsies were obtained from theUVB-exposed skin sites and from nonirradiated skin. One skin specimenobtained from each exposure dose was immediately ¢xed in 10% bu¡eredformaldehyde for para⁄n-embedded sections, and the other skin specimenwas immediately stored at ^80 1C for western blot studies.T erminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick end labeling (TUNEL)assay UVB-irradiated skin specimens were examined for the presence ofapoptotic cells by the TUNEL assay . This assay identi¢es apoptotic cellsand allows to quantify reliably the number of TUNEL-positive cells. Weused ApopTag Fluorescein In Situ Apoptosis detection kit (S7110,Intergenco, Inc., Purchase, New Y ork; www .intergenco.com). This kitlabels digoxigenin-labeled 30-OH ends of the genomic DNA. Brie£y , 5mm sections were depara⁄nized with xylene, treated with series of graded
alcohols, washed once in phosphate-bu¡ered saline and subsequentlytreated with proteinase K (Sigma, St Louis, Missouri; www .sigma-aldrich.com) (20 mg per mL) for 15 min at 37 1C. After proteinasedigestion, sections were incubated with 75 mL equilibration bu¡er for 10 s.Sections were then incubated in a humidi¢ed chamber with terminaldeoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme for 1 h at 37 1C. Incubation of onesection with phosphate-bu¡ered saline was used as a negative control. Thesections were then soaked in working strength stop/wash bu¡er, agitatedfor 15 s and rinsed in three changes with phosphate-bu¡ered saline. Afterrinsing, sections were incubated with anti-digoxigenin £uorescein for30 min at room temperature. Finally , sections were rinsed with threewashes of phosphate-bu¡ered saline and counterstained with propidiumiodide/anti-fade. The slides were viewed under a £uorescence microscopeequipped with a l¼380^420 nm emission ¢lter (Axiophot, Go ºttingen,
Germany). TUNEL-positive cells were counted using a 40 /C2objectivelens on ¢ve randomly selected ¢elds per section. A total of three sectionsper sample were analyzed.

A total of three sectionsper sample were analyzed.Immunohistochemistry staining for PCNA Immunohistochemicalassays were performed using mouse anti-human PCNA antibody clonePC10 (cat. no. M 0879, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and a M.O.M. kitstaining procedure (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California;www .vectorlabs.com). Brie£y , 5 mm thick sections were depara⁄nizedand hydrated slowly with xylene and graded alcohol series andsubsequently rinsed for 5 min in water. After appropriate antigenunmasking by using standard techniques, the endogenous peroxidaseactivity was blocked by incubating the skin sections with 3% hydrogenperoxide in water for 5 min. Then avidin/biotin blocking was applied and
sections were incubated for 1 h in working solution of M.O.M. mouseimmunoglobulin blocking reagent. Next, sections were incubated withmouse anti-human PCNA monoclonal antibody diluted 1:1000 inM.O.M. diluent for 4 h at room temperature. Slides were rinsed withphosphate-bu¡ered saline, and subsequently incubated with workingsolution of M.O.M. biotinylated anti-mouse IgG reagent for 10 min atroom temperature. ABC reagent (Vectastain, Vector Laboratories) wasadded to sections for 5 min 3,30-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) peroxidasesubstrate solution was used as a chromogen followed by a lightcounterstaining with Mayer’s hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories) for 1min, cleared with xylene, mounted with a coverslip and examined undera light microscope. Cells showing a brown nuclear reaction indicatedproliferating cells and were considered PCNA positive. The slides were
examined and scored under a light microscope. PCNA-positive andPCNA-negative cells in every randomly selected ¢eld were counted usinga2 0/C2objective lens. Labeling index was calculated as the percentage of400 GONZA ŁLEZ ET AL THE JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE DERMATOLOGY
PCNA-positive keratinocytes speci¢cally in the basal cell layer. A total of¢ve ¢elds per slide and three slides per sample were evaluated.BrdU incorporation into DNA BrdU, a thymidine analog that isincorporated into proliferating cells mainly during the S-phase of DNAsynthesis, was detected by a biotinylated mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUantibody (Olsen and Kirkhus, 1989) (Clone BU 33, product no. B2531,Sigma) and a M.O.M. kit staining procedure (Vector Laboratories).Brie£y , all animals were intraperitoneally injected with BrdU (Sigma) innormal saline (50 mg per kg) and killed 1 h after injection. Sections fromall skin samples were prepared as described above for PCNA immuno-histochemistry . Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubatingthe sections in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 min at roomtemperature. DNA denaturation was achieved by incubating sections in 2M HCl for 30 min at 37 1C. Slides were rinsed thoroughly in phosphate-
bu¡ered saline and incubated in a moist chamber with 0.1% trypsin for 10min at 37 1C; they were then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUantibody . Subsequent steps were performed similar to PCNA stainingdescribed above. The slides were examined and scored under a lightmicroscope using a 20 /C2objective lens. The BrdU labeling index (LI) wascalculated from the number of stained BrdU-positive cells per 100 basalcells counted in each ¢eld. A total of ¢ve ¢elds per section, and threesections per sample were analyzed.W estern blot analysis Epidermal sheets were separated by incubatingskin biopsies in 6 M NaBr solution for 1 to 2 h. Only separated epidermiswas processed for homogenization and subsequent western blot analysis.Next, proteins were extracted with a lysis bu¡er consisting of 0.25 MTris^HCl (pH 7.5), 0.375 M NaCl, 2.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% TritonX-100, 25 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl £uoride, and 0.1 mg
2, 1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl £uoride, and 0.1 mgaprotinin per mL as described byY aar et al(1991). Equal amounts of proteinextract (50 mg), quanti¢ed by Bradford method were processed for westernblot analysis (Goukassian et al2000). Antibody reactions were performedwith 1:200 dilutions of a⁄nity-puri¢ed mouse monoclonal and rabbitpolyclonal antibodies. Anti-PCNA (Ab-2) (Oncogene Science Inc.,Cambridge, Massachusetts) was used as primary antibody . The secondaryrabbit and donkey anti-mouse antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc,Santa Cruz, California) were used at 1:2000 dilution. Equal protein loadingin each lane was con¢rmed by hybridization with a 1:2000 dilution of b-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc.). Antibody binding wasdetected by ECL detection kit (Amersham, Piscataway , New Jersey),followed by autoradiography (Kodak X-Omatic AR, Rochester, NewJersey). Autoradiographs of western blots were scanned (Microtek Scan
Maker II, Taiwan) and band intensity was quanti¢ed after backgroundsubtraction by using densitometric program ‘‘Sigma gel’’ (Jandel Scienti¢c,Corte Madera, California). Normalization for loading of the lanes wasdetermined by Coomassie blue staining using multiple lanes.Statistical analyses Results are expressed as the mean 7SD. Data wereevaluated by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test and analysis of varianceusing the StarView statistical program. The level of statistical signi¢cancewas taken as p o0.05.RESULTSOral administration of lutein and zeaxanthin suppressesUVB-induced skin in£ammation To evaluate the protectivee¡ect of oral administration of lutein and zeaxanthin againstUVB-induced in£ammation we measured ear skin bifold-thickness.

Immuno£uorescence microphotographs ofrepresentative control irradiated skin ( Fig 2 a1) and irradiatedskin from mice fed with 0.04% ( Fig 2 a2) and 0.4% ( Fig 2 a3)lutein and zeaxanthin supplemented diets are shown. When adose of either 80 or 160 mJ per cm2of UVB irradiation wasused, almost all the cells in epidermis became TUNEL positive(data not shown) and the number of apoptotic cells per ¢eld inthe epidermis of control (clear bars, Fig 2 b) irradiated animalsincreased in a dose-dependent manner. In mice fed with luteinand zeaxanthin at 0.04% (black bars, Fig 2 b) for 2 wk before
UVB irradiation, the number of TUNEL-positive cells inducedby 40 mJ per cm2of UVB radiation was signi¢cantly reduced(po0.01). This reduction was even greater (by 210%, p o0.001)when mice were fed with lutein and zeaxanthin at 0.4% (stripedbarsFig 2 b). This reduction in the number of apoptotic cells wassimilar in specimens obtained at 24 and 48 h ( Fig 2 b).Oral administration of lutein and zeaxanthin decreases thenumber of UVB-induced PCNA-positive cells in murineskin To determine whether dietary administration of luteinand zeaxanthin a¡ects epidermal cell proliferation after UVBirradiation, skin biopsies from irradiated and nonirradiated skinof mice were examined for PCNA expression by immuno-histochemical and western blot analyses. In nonirradiated skin ofmice receiving a normal diet, the PCNA immunoreactivity waslimited to the basal layer ( Fig 3 a1). Strong nuclearimmunostaining was detected throughout the entire epidermis
of UV irradiated control ( Fig 3 a2) and mice fed with 0.04%(Fig 3 a3) and 0.4% ( Fig 3 a4) lutein and zeaxanthin.Signi¢cantly higher numbers of PCNA-positive cells, however,were observed in control versus lutein and zeaxanthin fedanimals ( Fig 3 a2,a3,a4) consistent with UV-inducedhyperproliferative response. To estimate the PCNA labelingindex in our studies we counted only the basal PCNA-positivekeratinocytes. At 24 and 48 h after exposure to UVB radiation,there was a UVB dose-dependent increase in PCNA labelingindex ( Fig 3 b). Oral administration of diets enriched with luteinand zeaxanthin at 0.04% (black bars) or 0.4% (striped bars) for 2wk before irradiation with 40 mJ per cm2reduced the percentageof basal PCNA-positive cells by 35% and 14%, respectively .Compared with control fed animals (clear bars), PCNA labelingindex was signi¢cantly reduced for all UVB doses at both timepoints (p o0.05) ( Fig 3 b). PCNA protein expression was also
examined by western blot analysis. ( Fig 4 b) There was astatistically signi¢cant decrease compared with control in PCNAprotein levels in 0.4% (striped bars) lutein and zeaxanthin fedFigure1.

animals irradiated with 40 and 80 mJ per cm2UVB. At lower(40 mJ per cm2) UVB dose mice fed with 0.04% (black bars)lutein and zeaxanthin also showed an approximately 29%decrease in PCNA protein levels, which was not statisticallysigni¢cant ( Fig 4 b, left panel). Lutein and zeaxanthinsupplementation did not have any e¡ect on PCNA protein levelsafter the highest (160 mJ per cm2) UVB dose ( Fig 4 b, rightpanel). Of note, slightly di¡erent results of PCNA expression inimmunohistochemical and western blot analysis, are most likelydue to our methodologic approach of counting PCNA-positivecells only in the basal layer (immunochemistry), whereas theentire epidermal sheets were processed for western blot analysis.Oral administration of lutein and zeaxanthin reduces UVB-induced increase in BrdU incorporation into basal epidermalkeratinocytesTo evaluate the number of proliferating basalkeratinocytes that are predominantly in the S-phase of cell cycle
we measured the BrdU incorporation into the DNA of basalkeratinocytes.In unirradiated mice skin, only a fraction of basal keratinocyteswas found in the S-phase, as shown by BrdU incorporation ( Fig5a1). UVB exposure alone increased BrdU incorporation intoepidermal DNA in a dose-dependent manner and theseincreases were 2- to 4-fold the baseline values ( Fig 5 a2).Signi¢cantly lower numbers of BrdU-positive cells wereobserved in animals fed with 0.04% ( Fig 5 a3) and 0.4% ( Fig5a4) lutein and zeaxanthin at all given UVB doses. To calculatethe BrdU incorporation index only the fraction of basal BrdU-positive cells were counted. The percentage of BrdU-positivebasal cells was reduced in samples obtained from lutein andzeaxanthin fed mice 24 and 48 h after UVB irradiation ( Fig 5 b).This decrease in the percentage of BrdU-positive basal keratinocyteswas lutein and zeaxanthin concentration dependent. At 24 h (leftpanel) and 48 h (right panel) after UVB exposure, the increase in
the percentage of BrdU-positive cells was signi¢cantly reducedfor all UVB doses tested in mice receiving 0.04% (black bars)and 0.4% (striped bars) lutein and zeaxanthin (p o0.05).DISCUSSIONTo our knowledge, this is one of the ¢rst in vivo studies evaluatingat cutaneous cellular level the protective e¡ects of oral intake oflutein and zeaxanthin against epidermal hyperproliferation andin£ammation induced by single exposure doses of UVB radia-tion. An acute exposure of human or murine skin to UVB radia-tion from natural sunlight or arti¢cial light sources results invarious biologic responses, through the direct formation of cyclo-butane pyrimidine dimers and (6^4)pyrimidine pyrimidone di-mers in DNA (Cadet and Vigny , 1990; Cadet et al, 1992). UVBexposure also results in the formation of free radicals and ROSthat damage DNA and non-DNA cellular targets. Among the lat-
ter, lipid-rich cellular membranes are particularly vulnerable tothe deleterious e¡ects of ROS. These biologic changes includecell cycle arrest, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and reparative hyper-plasia during the early adaptive response and are considered to beinvolved in the pathophysiology of the UV-induced erythema,premature skin aging, and skin cancer (Norris et al,1 9 9 3 ;Y o u n g ,1993). In recent years, our research interest has been focusing onminimizing the adverse acute and chronic UV responses usingnatural antioxidants known to act as radical scavengers and radicalquenchers in vivo (Gonza ¤lez and Pathak, 1996; Gonza ¤lezet al,1997). In this study , we showed that supplementation of dietswith 0.4% and 0.04% lutein and zeaxanthin for a period of 2wk reduced UV-induced increases in the number of apoptoticcells and proliferating cells in the epidermis of the hairless albino(SKh-1) mouse model when exposed to graded doses of UVBradiation.

(SKh-1) mouse model when exposed to graded doses of UVBradiation.Only few studies in the past several years have reported thebene¢cial antioxidant properties of certain carotenoids in photo-protection of skin against UV radiation (Mathews-Roth et al,1970, 1972; Stahl et al, 2000). Recently , Granstein and his cowor-kers1reported an anti-in£ammatory e¡ect of lutein in the skin ofmice exposed to UV radiation. Mice were fed diets containing0.04% and 0.4% lutein for 2 wk; ears were then exposed toUVB radiation to induce in£ammation. The thickness of ear skinof mice before and 24 h after UV radiation was evaluated. The earswelling in response to UV radiation was signi¢cantly inhibitedin the mice fed lutein diet relative to the controls receiving nodietary supplementation of lutein and zeaxanthin. In our studiesreported here we have con¢rmed these observations. Stahl et al(2000) examined the e¡ect of carotenoids (mainly b-carotene)
and carotenoids plus vitamin E on the skin of human volunteerson the development of erythema after exposure to UV radiation.The erythematous response was signi¢cantly reduced after 8 wkof supplementation with a carotenoid mixture that includedb-carotene and a small fraction of lutein. The ability of b-caro-tene, lutein, and astaxanthin to protect against UV A-induced oxi-dative stress in cultured rat kidney ¢broblasts was also recentlyreported by O’Connor and O’Brien (1998).

as thiobarbituric reactive substance were evaluated to ascertainenzymatic changes resulting from oxidative stress induced byUV A radiation. b-carotene, lutein, and astaxanthin were foundto protect against enzymatic changes with astaxanthin exhibitingsuperior photoprotective properties (O’Connor and O’Brien,1998).Lutein and zeaxanthin, nonprovitamin A carotenoids, are thepredominant carotenoids found in human retina and their con-centration is greatest in the fovea centralis of the macula lutea ofhuman retina where they constitute the macular pigment andserve to decrease the risk of age-related macular degeneration(Beatty et al, 1999; Pratt, 1999) and to protect the retinal pigmentepithelium against a photooxidative damage initiated in part bylight absorption (Snodderly , 1995; Broekmans et al, 2002). Thereis good evidence that this protection is due mainly to their anti-oxidant properties (Handleman and Dratz, 1986; Zhang et al,1 9 9 1 ;
Taylor et al, 1993; Sujak et al, 1999). In vitro lutein and zeaxanthinhas been shown to be more e¡ective than b-carotene in inhibit-ing auto-oxidation of cellular lipids (Zhang et al,1 9 9 1 )a n di nfurther protecting against oxidant-induced cell damage (Martinet al,1 9 9 6 ) .It is becoming more apparent that many of the maladies thata¡ect human skin are the result of direct and indirect environ-mental interaction invariably caused by UV radiation. Excessiveand often uncontrolled exposure to terrestrial solar radiation isharmful to human skin and causes acute sunburn, damage to epi-dermal and dermal cells, induction of cell death, immune sup-pression, and eventually skin cancer (Y oung, 1993). Currently themost widely accepted method of photoprotection against UV ra-diation is the use of two or more topical sunscreens containingUVB and UV A absorbing chemicals that are nonphotolabile(e.g., octyl methoxy cinnamate, octyl dimethyl amino benzoate,
benzophenones, or avobenzone (parsol 1789), etc.) with or with-out admixture of UV scattering and re£ecting chemicals (e.g.,ZnO,TiO2in micronized form) incorporated in a water-resistantbase. Other approaches, including chemicals with antioxidantproperties such as vitamin C, vitamin E, b-carotene, etc., are alsoadvocated (Thompson et al, 1993; Naylor et al, 1995; Green et al,1999; Pathak et al, 1999; Stahl et al, 2000). The in vivo presence ofe¡ective antioxidants such as lutein and zeaxanthin in the skinprior to UVB irradiation may reduce the deleterious e¡ect of ir-radiation, most likely by decreasing the generation of UV-in-duced ROS (Athar et al, 1992; Dalle Carbonare and Pathak,1992). Although b-carotene has been examined in our labora-tories in the past (Mathews-Roth et al, 1970; 1972; Greenberg et al,1990), we feel that the antioxidant lutein is less labile and thusbetter than b-carotene in minimizing the photooxidative changes
in the skin. Comparative studies using lutein and b-carotene,however, have to be done to verify the better photoprotectiveproperties of lutein and zeaxanthin. Because UV-induced in£am-mation and hyperproliferation (Pentland et al,1 999 ;A n et al,2 0 0 2 )has been strongly involved in UVB carcinogenesis, inhibitory ef-fects of dietary lutein and zeaxanthin on acute in£ammation, andepidermal hyperproliferation may have a potential implicationfor the prevention of carcinogenesis in chronically UV-exposedskin.The authors want to thank Martine Sifakis and William Farinelli for excellent tech-nical assistance and Kemin Foods L.C.
