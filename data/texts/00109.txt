of a novel MGO Manuka Honey microemulsion(MHME) eye cream for the management of blepharitisin human subjects.Methods and analysis Twenty-five healthy subjectswere enrolled in a prospective, randomised, paired-eye,investigator-masked trial. The MHME eye cream(Manuka Health New Zealand) was applied to theclosed eyelids of one eye (randomised) overnight for2 weeks. LogMAR visual acuity, eyelid irritationsymptoms, ocular surface characteristics and tear filmparameters were assessed at baseline, day 7 and day14. Expression of markers of ocular surfaceinflammation (matrix metalloproteinase-9 andinterleukin-6) and goblet cell function (MUC5AC) werequantified using impression cytology at baseline andday 14.Results There were no significant changes in visualacuity, eyelid irritation symptoms, ocular surfacecharacteristics, tear film parameters and inflammatorymarker expression during the 2-week treatment periodin treated and control eyes (all p>0.05), and
in treated and control eyes (all p>0.05), andmeasurements did not differ significantly between eyes(all p>0.05). No major adverse events were reported.Two subjects experienced transient ocular stinging,presumably due to migration of the product into theeye, which resolved following aqueous irrigation.Conclusion The MHME eye cream application wasfound to be well tolerated in healthy human subjectsand was not associated with changes in visual acuity,ocular surface characteristics, tear film parameters,expression of markers of inflammation or goblet cellfunction. The findings support future clinical efficacytrials in patients with blepharitis.Trial registration number ACTRN12616000540415INTRODUCTIONBlepharitis is a common chronic inflamma-tory condition of the eyelids, associated withocular surface irritation and dry eye develop-ment.1–5It can have a significant impact onocular comfort, vision and quality of life.1 6 7Classified anatomically into anterior and
posterior blepharitis, the former affects theanterior eyelid lamellae and eyelashes, andthe latter affects the posterior lamellae, mostcommonly as a result of Meibomian glanddysfunction.1–4Although the pathophysi-ology of blepharitis is not fully understood,both anatomical subtypes are associated withabnormally high levels of bacterial colonisa-tion, which may contribute towards theinflammatory process.2Lipases fromKey messagesWhat is already known about this subject?"Blepharitis is a common eyelid inflammatorycondition, often characterised by intermittentepisodes of inflammatory exacerbations,associated with high bacterial load.

bacteria contribute to tear film destabilisation and exac-erbate symptoms of ocular irritation and dry eye.8 9The natural history of blepharitis is commonly char-acterised by intermittent episodes of inflammatoryexacerbations, associated with high bacterial load.1 2Current management strategies involve a combinationapproach of topical antibiotics and anti-inflammatoryagents during exacerbations and the long-term use ofeyelid hygiene techniques and/or warm compresses.2 35However, symptoms often persist despite treatment,12negatively affecting perceived therapeutic efficacy.Furthermore, concerns of antibiotic resistance andrisks of side effects of anti-inflammatory agents necessi-tate prudent clinical judgement surrounding their use12and highlight the need for alternative managementstrategies to be developed.New Zealand native M /C22anuka ( Leptospermum scoparium )honey has received interest for its reported antimicro-bial and anti-inflammatory properties.10–13A topical
formulation of MGO Manuka Honey microemulsion(MHME) was recently developed as an eye cream forperiocular use.14In vitro and in vivo preclinical studiesof the product have shown promising results,suggesting potential for clinical efficacy and safety inthe management of blepharitis.14This trial is the firstto evaluate the safety and tolerability of the MHME eyecream, in human subjects, through the clinical assess-ment of the ocular surface and tear film and laboratoryanalysis of inflammation and goblet cell functionmarker expression.MATERIAL AND METHODSSubjectsThis prospective, 2-week, randomised, paired eye,investigator-masked trial, followed the tenets of theDeclaration of Helsinki, was approved by the institu-tional ethics committee and was registered as a clinicaltrial (ACTRN12616000540415). Participants wererequired to be 18 years or older and non-contact lenswearers, with no history of major systemic, dermatolog-
ical or ocular conditions, non-pregnant, no previousocular surgery, no use of topical or systemicmedications known to affect the eye and no allergies orhypersensitivity to topical medications or bee products.Eligible participants were enrolled after providingwritten informed consent and were required to attendthree visits over the 2-week period at baseline, day 7and day 14.A total of 25 eligible participants were recruited,exceeding the sample size requirements for the desiredstudy power. The designated outcome measure fordetermining sample size was tear film lipid layergrade. Power calculations showed that a minimum of15 subjects was required to detect a clinically significantdifference of one lipid layer grade in any of the pair-wise comparisons, with 80% power ( b=0.2), at a two-sided statistical significance level of 5% ( a=0.05). Thestandard deviation (SD) of normal values was estimatedat one lipid layer grade.15Sample size estimates were
determined using a uniform non-parametric adjust-ment, with PASS 2002 (NCSS StatisticalSoftware, Kaysville, Utah, USA).TreatmentsParticipants were randomly assigned to apply theMHME eye cream ( figure 1 ), which was manufacturedaccording to Good Manufacturing Practice(GMP) standards (Manuka Health New Zealand) to theleft or right eye (treated eye) once a day, at night, for aperiod of 14 days. The fellow eye received no interven-tion (control eye). Two 20 mL tubes of eye cream wereprovided to each participant, and product applicationwas demonstrated during the enrolment visit. Instruc-tions were given to participants to squeezeapproximately a 0.5–1 cm strip of the product (equiva-lent to a minimum of approximately 0.034 g /C60.001 g)onto clean fingertips and to spread the cream thinlyover the periocular skin of the closed upper and lowereyelids of one eye, in order to avoid direct contact withthe ocular surface. Participants were then instructed to
wash their hands immediately to prevent cross-contam-
eyelids of one eye, in order to avoid direct contact withthe ocular surface. Participants were then instructed towash their hands immediately to prevent cross-contam-ination of the fellow eye. Participants were also advisedagainst facial cleansing until the following morningand to exercise care to avoid the transfer of residualproducts to the fellow eye during facial cleansing anddrying. Unused product was returned to the investiga-tors at the end of the 14-day trial period and weighedas a measure of patient compliance.Clinical measurementsMcMonnies Dry Eye Questionnaire was administeredto grade the severity of dry eye symptomatology atbaseline. A telephone interview was conductedfollowing the first day of eye cream application tocheck for immediate tolerability issues or adverseevents. Participants were advised to contact the investi-gators during the treatment period to report adverseevents at any other time.The investigators conducting clinical measurements
were masked to treatment randomisation.

were assessed at a single site, with a mean /C6SD roomtemperature of 20.2/C14C/C61.4/C14C and relative humidity of69.1% /C64.6%. Clinical assessments were performed atbaseline, day 7 and day 14 of the treatment period.Six-metre best spectacle-corrected LogMAR visualacuity (VA) was recorded. Participants were asked torate symptoms of eyelid itching and pain on a four-point grading scale: grade 0, absent; grade 1, mild;grade 2, moderate; grade 3, severe. Bulbar conjunctivalhyperaemia and palpebral erythema was assessed usingthe Oculus Keratograph 5M, on a grading scale from 0to 4, using automated objective evaluation and estima-tion to the nearest 0.5 grade from high magnificationdigital imaging, respectively.Tear film lipid layer grade and non-invasive tear filmbreak-up time were assessed using the Oculus Kerato-graph 5M. Tear film lipid layer grading was based onthe Guillon-Keeler grading system: grade 1, openmeshwork; grade 2, closed meshwork; grade 3, wave or
flow; grade 4, amorphous; grade 5, coloured fringes;grade 0, non-continuous layer (non-visible or abnormalcoloured fringes).16Break-up time was recorded as thetime taken following a blink for the grid reflection tofirst show distortion, while the subject maintained fixa-tion and was requested to refrain from blinking. Threemeasurements were averaged in each case.The lower tear meniscus height was assessed usinghigh magnification digital imaging captured by theOculus Keratograph 5M. Three measurements nearthe centre of the lower meniscus were averaged. Tearevaporation rate was measured using a Vapometer(Delfin, Kuopio, Finland) within a swimming gogglehousing.17Differences between the evaporation ratesin the open and closed eye state were recorded tofactor out skin evaporation and allow quantification ofevaporation from the tear film of the exposed ocularsurface only. Tear film osmolarity was evaluated with aclinical osmometer (TearLab, San Diego, California,
USA), using 50 nL tear samples collected from thelower lid tear meniscus. Two measurements were takenfrom each eye, and the higher reading for each eye wasrecorded.Sodium fluorescein and lissamine green dyes wereapplied, in turn, to the bulbar conjunctiva in order toevaluate localised corneal and conjunctival epithelialdesiccation. Staining was recorded using the modifiedTable 1 Repeated-measures analysis of variance of measurements for treatment, time and interaction (treatment-by-time)effects.

Oxford grading scheme, where the nasal and temporalconjunctiva were divided into three areas each, and thecornea into five areas.18Staining was graded from 0 to5 with increasing confluence in each area and summedto provide a maximum score of 55. Lid wiper epitheli-opathy (LWE) grade was assessed using lissaminegreen dye.19Quantitative real-time PCRConjunctival impression cytology was conducted atbaseline and day 14 of the treatment period, followingtopical anaesthetic application of one drop of Oxybu-procaine hydrochloride 0.4% (minims; Bausch & Lomb(NZ), Auckland, New Zealand) at the ocular surface.Bulbar conjunctival cells from the superior temporalocular surface were collected using the EYEPRIMconjunctival impression device (OPIATechnologies, Paris, France). RNA extraction and puri-fication from the conjunctival cell samples wasconducted using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). Extracted RNA samples were tested
for the presence of inhibitors before undergoingcomplementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis. Synthesis wasperformed using the SuperScript VILO cDNASynthesis Kit and Master Mix (Invitrogen by Life Tech-nologies). A standard beta-actin PCR and subsequentgel electrophoresis was run on a representative selec-tion of the synthesised cDNA samples to ensure cDNAsynthesis was successful. Six reference genes weretested among the sample population for stability withbeta-actin and B2M being established as the moststable genes according to the NormFinder algorithm(MOMA, Aarhus, Denmark). A normalisation factorwas calculated as the geometric mean of the expressionof these two most stable genes and, in accordance withcurrently accepted practice,20the genes of interestwere quantified relatively against this factor. Quantita-tive PCR (qPCR) runs for quantifying the three genesof interest; matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), inter-leukin-6 (IL-6) and mucin-5AC (MUC5AC) were set up
using the QiAgility PCR robot (Qiagen, Valencia, Cali-fornia, USA) with PrimeTime Assays (Integrated DNATechnologies). Internal calibrators were used in allqPCR to compensate for inter-run variations.Minimum Information for Publication of QuantitativeReal-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines werefollowed to ensure validity of the qPCR experiments.21StatisticsStatistical analyses were performed with GraphPadPrism V.6.02 (http://www.graphpad.com). Repeatedmeasures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)testing was performed to test the significance oftreatment, time and interaction (treatment-by-time)effects on measurements over the 2-week period,where continuous variables with a normal distributionhad been confirmed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test(p>0.05). Non-normally distributed continuous meas-ures (non-invasive tear break-up time (NIBUT) andimpression cytology measurements) were logarithmi-cally transformed before being assessed. Ordinal data
were converted to rank-values prior to undergoinganalysis. Post hoc analysis for the significance oftreatment effects at each time point was conductedusing multiplicity adjusted Sidak’s test. All tests weretwo tailed, and p<0.05 was considered significant.Data are presented as mean /C6SD, or median (IQR)unless otherwise stated.RESULTSThe mean /C6SD age of the 25 participants (eight male,17 female) was 29 /C68 years. The mean /C6SD McMonniesscore was 7.2 /C63.5, with only one participant (4%)displaying a score of /C2115. The mean /C6SD amount ofproduct used during the 14-day trial period was1.8/C61.3 g, exceeding, in 96% of cases, the expectedminimum total application of approximately 0.5 g ofproduct over 14 days, according to the participantinstructions, and reflecting good levels of compliance.Tables 1 and 2 illustrate the summary statistics ofclinical and impression cytology measurements madeduring the 2-week treatment period.

No furtheradverse events were reported during the remainderof the treatment period, and no participants with-drew early from the trial.General clinical evaluationRepeated measures ANOVA demonstrated no signifi-cant treatment, time or treatment-by-time interactioneffects on best-corrected VA, eyelid itching and paingrades (all p>0.05, table 1 ). Post hoc analysis showedthat measurements did not change significantly duringthe 2-week period in either treated or control eyes (allp>0.05, table 2 ), and there were no significant differ-ences between groups at day 7 or day 14 (all p>0.05).Ocular surface evaluationThe effects of treatment, time and treatment-by-timeinteraction on bulbar conjunctival hyperaemia, palpe-bral erythema, ocular surface staining and LWE were
not found to be significant (all p>0.05, table 1 ). Therewere no changes in ocular surface characteristics ineither treated or control eyes during the treatmentperiod (all p>0.05, table 2 ), and measurements at day7 and day 14 were not found to differ significantlybetween groups (all p>0.05).Tear film evaluationThere were no significant treatment, time or treat-ment-by-time interaction effects on lipid layer grade,tear evaporation rate, non-invasive tear film break-uptime, tear film osmolarity or tear meniscus height (allp>0.05, table 1 ). During the 14-day period, tear filmparameters did not change significantly in eithertreated or control eyes (all p>0.05, table 2 ), and nodifferences were observed between groups at day 7 orday 14 (all p>0.05).Quantitative real-time PCRConjunctival impression cytology samples were inade-quate for two participants, and thus samples from only23 participants were analysed. Expression levels of
MMP-9, IL-6 and MUC5AC did not change from base-line to day 14 in either treated or control eyes (allp>0.05, table 2 ). On day 14, levels of all impressioncytology markers did not differ between treated andcontrol eyes (all p>0.05).DISCUSSIONCurrent management strategies for blepharitis aim toprevent and manage inflammatory exacerbations, whichcan be associated with high bacterial loads.1–3 5However, concerns surrounding commonly used anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory therapeutic agents,including antibiotic resistance and the long-term effectsof corticosteroid use, suggest the need for alternativemanagement strategies. The natural antibacterial andanti-inflammatory properties of New Zealand’s nativeM/C22anuka honey have been reported, previously.10–13Anophthalmic formulation of MGO MHME was recentlydeveloped for periocular topical application.14Preclin-ical studies have confirmed the in vitro antimicrobialefficacy of cyclodextrin-complexed Manuka honey on
bacteria commonly associated with blepharitis,22the invitrosafety on human corneal cells and in vivo tolerabilityon rabbit eyes following the instillation of the MHMEproduct diluted to 10%.14Clinical safety of the MHME eye cream was demon-strated by the results of this study. During the treatmentperiod, no significant change in VA was observed intreated eyes, and measurements did not differ betweentreated and control eyes. All ocular surface and tear filmmeasurements remained within normal limitsthroughout the study period. Bulbar hyperaemia, palpe-bral erythema and ocular surface staining did notchange during the 2-week period in treated eyes, and nodifferences were detected between groups. This suggeststhat periocular application of the eye cream was notassociated with signs of ocular surface irritation, inflam-mation or epithelial damage. There were no significantchanges in tear film parameters in treated eyes during
the 14-day period, and measurements were not signifi-cantly different between treated and control eyes. This
changes in tear film parameters in treated eyes duringthe 14-day period, and measurements were not signifi-cantly different between treated and control eyes. Thissuggests that the ophthalmic formulation does notexhibit tear film destabilising effects.The safety profile of the formulation was furthersupported by the quantification of markers of ocularsurface inflammation and goblet cell function, fromconjunctival impression cytology. MMP-9 is a matrixdegrading enzyme,23which is thought to play a path-ological role in inflammatory disease, throughcleaving tight junction proteins and resulting inepithelial cell layer disruption.24Dry eye inducedtear film hyperosmolarity can trigger the stress-acti-vated protein kinase signalling cascade, leading tothe release of MMP-9 from corneal epithelial cells,25initiating a cycle of progressive inflammation.26IL-6is a pro-inflammatory cytokine released by conjunc-tival and corneal epithelium27and is an early
tival and corneal epithelium27and is an earlybiomarker of dry eye disease.28The upregulation ofIL-6 has been shown to correlate significantly withcorneal desiccation, staining and symptom severity.29MUC5AC is a goblet cell-specific mucin, which is anindication of conjunctival goblet cell density andintegrity.30Inflammatory assault at the ocular surfacecan result in reduced protein expression, which canbe associated with tear film instability and leave theeye susceptible to pathogenic invasion.31–33No signif-icant changes were observed in the expression levelsof the inflammatory and goblet cell function markersinvestigated in the treated eyes over the 2-weekperiod, and measurements did not differ betweentreated and control eyes.

unlikely to be any pro-inflammatory agents presentwithin the emulsion and suggests the safety profileof the treatment to be satisfactory.The findings of this study also showed that applica-tion of the formulation was generally well toleratedin healthy human subjects. No major ocular orsystemic adverse events were reported during the 2-week treatment period, and 23 (92%) of 25 subjectsdid not report any tolerability issues or adverseevents during the study period. Two subjectsreported a transient stinging sensation, presumablyrelated to product migration onto the ocular surface,following application in close proximity to theeyelash margin and the use of an excessive amountof eye cream, respectively. However, in both cases,symptoms resolved following aqueous irrigation ofthe ocular surface. The subjects were then instructedto carefully reapply smaller quantities of the productanterior to the eyelash margin, and no further
anterior to the eyelash margin, and no furtheradverse events were reported during the remainderof the trial period.The tolerability of product application was alsoreflected in self-reported symptoms of eyelid itchingand pain. No changes in eyelid symptomatologygrading were observed in treated eyes during the 2-week period, and there were no differences betweentreated eyes and control eyes. As a patient-appliedtreatment, the therapeutic potential of the formulationmay potentially be limited by compliance levels, whichcan be adversely affected by intolerability of treatmentside effects. The lack of major adverse events orchanges in eyelid symptoms in healthy subjects isencouraging and suggests potential for treatment toler-ability in patients with blepharitis.Of note, the MGO MHME formulation was foundto be well tolerated as an externally applied eyecream in healthy human subjects. The 2-week treat-ment application was not associated with any changes
in VA, ocular surface characteristics, tear film param-eters, inflammatory and goblet cell function markerexpression, and no major adverse events werereported. The results of the current study supportfuture trials, of longer duration, investigating theclinical efficacy of the ophthalmic formulation inblepharitis patients.Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to Salim Ismail, MSc, at theUniversity of Auckland, for technical support.
