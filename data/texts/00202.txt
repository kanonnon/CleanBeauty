Rosmarinus o ﬃcinalis L.(syn. Salvia rosmarinus Spenn.), popularly known as rosemary, is an aromatic plant with needle-likeleaves belonging to the Lamiaceae family. Rosemary has therapeutic properties and has been usedin the folk medicine, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics industries, mainly for its antioxidant andanti-inﬂammatory properties, which are attributed to the presence of carnosol /carnosic and ursolic
acids. The therapeutic use of rosemary has been explored for the treatment of inﬂammatory diseases;however, other uses have been studied, such as wound healing and skin cancer and mycosestreatments, among others. Besides it therapeutic uses, rosemary has potential applications in cosmeticformulations and in the treatment of pathological and non-pathological conditions, such as cellulite,alopecia, ultraviolet damage, and aging. This review aims to critically discuss the topical applicationsof rosemary found in the literature while also o ﬀering relevant information for the development oftopical formulations of its bioactive compounds.Keywords: rosemary; antioxidant; anti-inﬂammatory; ﬂavonoids; polyphenols; terpenes1. IntroductionThe use of herbal drugs to treat a broad spectrum of diseases and /or to modify non-pathologicalstates [ 1–4] has increased worldwide. It is known that the secondary metabolites of plants have
therapeutic e ﬀects; many have been used in the treatment of di ﬀerent diseases, such as obesity [ 5] andbrain [ 6] and skin diseases [ 7] as well as in the treatment of non-pathological states, such as aging [ 8].Rosmarinus o ﬃcinalis L., commonly known as rosemary, belongs to the Lamiaceae family. The genusRosmarinus has been merged into the genus Salvia in a recent phylogenetic analysis. This meansthat the Rosmarinus o ﬃcinalis is no longer the correct name of the species studied. Since the nameSalvia o ﬃcinalis was already occupied when the merger was done, this species needed a new speciﬁcepithet in Salvia, so it is now known under the name Salvia Rosmarinus [9–11]. It is an aromatic plantPlants 2020 ,9, 651; doi:10.3390 /plants9050651 www.mdpi.com /journal /plants
Plants 2020 ,9, 651 2 of 12with needle-like leaves that is cultivated worldwide. Rosemary has therapeutic properties and hasbeen used in folk medicine as an oral preparation to relieve renal colic, dysmenorrhea, and musclespasms [ 12–14]. Rosemary has antifungal, antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inﬂammatory, antitumor,antithrombotic, antinociceptive, antidepressant, antiulcerogenic, and antioxidant activities [ 13–15].Several medicinal applications for R. oﬃcinalis have been identiﬁed, such as treatment of disordersassociated with the nervous, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, menstrual, hepatic,and reproductive systems and with respiratory and skin conditions [ 13]. Owing to its diverseproperties, rosemary has also been used widely in the food and cosmetics industries [16].Many biomolecules have been identiﬁed to be responsible for the biological e ﬀects ofrosemary essential oil and crude extract. However, speciﬁc compounds causing these e ﬀects
have rarely been identiﬁed; this is due to the synergistic actions of several metabolites presentin rosemary [ 17]. Therefore, it is di ﬃcult to associate a therapeutic or cosmetic activity with an isolatedbiomolecule. del Baño et al. characterized the distribution of rosemary ﬂavonoids (eriocitrin, luteolin3’-O- β-D-glucuronide, hesperidin, diosmin, isoscutellarein 7-O-glucoside, hispidulin 7-O-glucoside,and genkwanin) in the leaves, ﬂowers, roots, and stems during di ﬀerent stages of the plant’s growth [ 18].It was also reported a high concentration of ﬂavonoids, polyphenols, and terpenes in R. oﬃcinalisleaves [ 19]. Rosemary contains an abundance of secondary metabolites, and their identiﬁcation byultra- and high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography has revealed highcontents of proﬁle phenolic compounds (diterpenoids and ﬂavonoids) and volatile compounds [ 20,21].
The biological activities of secondary metabolites and extracts of R. oﬃcinalis were reported instudies investigating various e ﬀects such as its antitumor, antioxidant, anti-infectious, anti-inﬂammatory,and analgesic activities and e ﬀects on the central nervous system, endocrine system, disorders such ascardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction, body weight changes, dyslipidemia, cerebral ischemia,hepato-nephrotoxicity, stress, and anxiety [ 22,23]. The anti-inﬂammatory activity of rosemary hasbeen attributed to the presence of carnosol and carnosic, rosmarinic, ursolic, oleanolic, and micromericacids, which act synergistically [ 24–26]. Speciﬁcally, the anti-inﬂammatory e ﬀect was also attributed tothe synergic e ﬀects of ursolic and micromeric acids present in rosemary extract. The attribution ofanti-inﬂammatory e ﬀects of the R. oﬃcinalis extract was due to the presence of ursolic, oleanolic, andmicromeric acid acting in combination [24].
micromeric acid acting in combination [24].The skin is the largest organ in the human body; sensation, regulation, and protection are amongits most critical functions [ 27]. To enhance the permeation of bioactive compounds through the skin,many approaches have been proposed. Of these approaches, nanocarriers including nanoemulsions,lipid nanoparticles, and liposomes have become popular owing to their lipid composition, enhancedbiocompatibility, and biodegradability [ 28–32]. The release proﬁle of the loaded bioactive compoundcan be modulated by altering the physicochemical composition of the nanocarrier matrix [33].The aim of this review was to survey the publications related to the topical applications of rosemaryand to discuss the formulations available for the delivery of the secondary metabolites of R. oﬃcinalis .2. MethodsThe Web of Science, Google Scholar, and SciELO databases were selected for research on the
topical uses of rosemary, using “ Rosmarinus o ﬃcinalis ” and “rosemary” as keywords. The authors areaware of the nomenclature update; however, literature still shows Rosmarinus o ﬃcinalis as the mainname for rosemary.
aware of the nomenclature update; however, literature still shows Rosmarinus o ﬃcinalis as the mainname for rosemary.3. Pharmaceutical ActivitiesRosemary (Table 1) has attracted attention because it contains secondary metabolites withtherapeutic potential, such as carnosol and carnosic, rosmarinic, ursolic, oleanolic, and micromericacids (Figure 1). These compounds have been applied topically and studied for their anti-inﬂammatorycapacity, wound-healing potential, e ﬀects on tissue survival, anti-skin-cancer e ﬀects, antinociceptiveeﬀects, antifungal e ﬀects, and UV-protective activity. The triterpenes ursolic, oleanolic, and micromeric

Secondary metabolites present in rosemaryextract showed stabilizer emulsion properties.[52]3.1. Anti-inﬂammatory ActivityThe inﬂammatory activity of R. oﬃcinalis extract is attributed to the presence of carnosol and
carnosic acid [53] and of ursolic, oleanolic, and micromeric acids [24].The bioactive compound carnosic acid was reported to be a potent nitric oxide (NO) inhibitor; NO isa pro-inflammatory mediator that induces or enhances the inflammatory process [ 35]. Low concentrationsof this metabolite (6.2 µg/mL) inhibited NO by approximately 72%, whereas complete inhibition wasreported at concentrations of >12.5µg/mL [ 36]. Using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH)assay , the R. officinalis extract was shown to possess strong antioxidant activity , supporting its potentialas an anti-inflammatory agent. The extract also exhibited antiplatelet activity, which is instrumentalfor the improvement of microcirculation. The maximum platelet inhibition occurred at a carnosic acidconcentration of 31 µg/mL [36].Mice with atopic dermatitis that were topically treated with carnosol showed a signiﬁcant reduction
in skin lesions compared with the control animals [ 26]. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inﬂammation ofthe skin characterized by the presence of eczematous and pruritic lesions related to several factors,such as inﬂammatory cells, cytokines, and enzymes (e.g., STAT3, iNOS, and COX-2) [ 37]. The lymphnode weight and size were signiﬁcantly increased, which is associated with a high immunoglobulinE production [ 38]. Carnosol was able to reduce the amounts of immunoglobulin E, neutrophils,and inﬂammatory cytokines (TNF- αand IL-1 β) in the blood of mice. Histological sections of the earand dorsum showed that the skin of the animals treated with carnosol was thinner and showed lessinﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells and fewer mast cells compared with that of mice in the control group.Carnosol was able to reduce the expression of the enzymes iNOS and COX-2. Although it did notaﬀect the expression of STAT3, the metabolite was able to inhibit the activity of this enzyme in in vitro
assays; di ﬀerent concentrations of carnosol (1.2 and 5 µM) reduced NO production in LPS-treatedRAW 264.7 cells [26].R. oﬃcinalis did not show signiﬁcant anti-inﬂammatory e ﬀects in induced dermatitis. In a study,the eﬀect of extracts of marigold and rosemary on irritant contact dermatitis induced by sodium laurylsulfate was evaluated in healthy human volunteers. Both extracts were incorporated into the basecream DAC (Deutscher Arzneimittel Codex =German Pharmaceutical Codex) at a 5% concentration.
Plants 2020 ,9, 651 5 of 12The e ﬀect of this formulation on irritant contact dermatitis was evaluated visually using bioengineeringmethods (e.g., chromametry and tewametry). These extracts were shown to have no anti-inﬂammatoryeﬀect on existing dermatitis; however, when applied simultaneously with the irritant, the inﬂammatoryprocess was reduced, indicating that they exerted a protective e ﬀect against the development of induceddermatitis [54].Evaluation of the topical anti-inﬂammatory e ﬀects of the extracts of rosemary leaves preparedwith solvents of increasing polarity in vivo was performed using the croton oil-induced ear edematest. The extract obtained with n-hexane and chloroform exhibited important dose-dependentanti-inﬂammatory activity, whereas that obtained with methanol had a weak anti-inﬂammatory e ﬀect.The extracts obtained with chloroform ((ID 50=83µg/cm2) and n-hexane (ID 50=265µg/cm2) showed
an anti-inﬂammatory activity similar to that of indomethacin (ID 50=93µg/cm2) (used as reference,with a discrete e ﬀect) [24].3.2. Skin CancerThe e ﬀects of R. oﬃcinalis hydroalcoholic extract were tested on human melanoma A375 cells; theextract resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of human melanoma cell proliferation. Mutations inmelanocytes are attributed to the excessive exposure of the skin to sunlight and induce the developmentof melanomas [ 55–57]. The cell cycle proliferation was inhibited in vitro because of the cytotoxic andcytostatic activity of the hydroalcoholic extract [ 39]. When a mouse model of skin cancer inducedby 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene was treated with a 500 or 1000 mg /kg oral dose of R. oﬃcinalishydroalcoholic extract for a period of 15 days, it led to a decrease in the number, diameter, weight,and incidence of tumors and an increase in the latency period [40].
Rosmarinic acid was shown to exhibit chemopreventive activity against 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced skin cancer; this was attributed to its anti-lipid peroxidation potential andits ability to modulate the detoxiﬁcation cascade and expression patterns of p53, bcl-2, caspase-3,and caspase-9 [ 41]. Carnosic acid was shown to have an important protective role against melanoma.This secondary metabolite inhibited the proliferation and adhesion of B16F10 melanoma cells in adose-dependent manner through the inhibition of the expression of cell migration markers (MMP-9,TIMP-1, uPA, and VCAM-1) and phosphorylation of signaling molecules (Akt, FAK, and Sr) [42].3.3. Wound HealingHealing is a complex dynamic process that results in the restoration of the anatomical barriersof the skin that may have been compromised by diseases or burns [ 58]. Diabetes was induced inmale BALB /c mice by the intraperitoneal injection of alloxan [ 1]. After conﬁrmation of hyperglycemia,
incisions that were 4 mm in diameter were made on the backs of the mice and the mice were allocatedto one of four treatments: control: vehicle, aqueous extract, and essential oil. The male BALB /c micein the essential oil group showed healing, angiogenesis, and improvements in granulation tissue atseveral stages compared with those in the aqueous extract group [ 1]. Another study using diabeticrats topically treated with oil extracted from R. oﬃcinalis reported accelerated wound healing in bothdiabetic and nondiabetic animals [43].Another study that explored the healing potential of rosemary was performed on 63 Wistarrats allocated to one of three treatments: control; 2% R. oﬃcinalis cream; and 4% R. oﬃcinalis cream.Wounds were made on each rat, and a solution containing Candida albicans was applied onto thesewounds. The results showed that wound healing in the 4% R. oﬃcinalis cream group was faster thanthat in the other groups [44].3.4. Skin Flap Survival

Plants 2020 ,9, 651 6 of 12One study compared animals allocated to three treatment groups: group I (control, the tissuewas cleaned only with saline solution); group II (application of the essential oil on the tissue twice perday for 1 week following skin evaluation); and group III (application of rosemary oil before and afterevaluation and at the end of the week, 30 min before the surgery). The survival rates were 29%, 59%,and 67% for groups I, II, and III, respectively. Compared with the control (group I), tissue necrosis wassigniﬁcantly lower and tissue viability was signiﬁcantly higher in groups II and III. Topical applicationof the oil in the week before the surgery increased the tissue survival rate (higher in group III than ingroup II). The study reported antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory, and vasodilatory activities of the oil asfactors for the increased tissue survival [45].3.5. Transdermal E ﬀects
3.5. Transdermal E ﬀectsTransdermal drug delivery means that the drug is able to reach systemic circulationwhen administered topically. Drugs can penetrate the skin through three di ﬀerent pathways:transappendageal (when the drug permeates through hair follicles and through sweat and sebaceousglands); paracellular (when the drug passes through the intercellular space); and transcellular (when thedrug passes through cells) [ 61]. The antinociceptive e ﬀects of the essential oil extracted from R. oﬃcinaliswere analyzed following the incorporation of three concentrations (0.1%, 0.5%, and 1%) of the essentialoil in a 1% diclofenac sodium gel. Two in vivo tests, the tail ﬂick tests and formalin test, were performedto compare the antinociceptive e ﬀects of the gel base (control), gel with 1% diclofenac, and gel with1% diclofenac plus 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1% rosemary oil. In both the in vivo assays, the 0.1% and 0.5%
concentrations resulted in no signiﬁcant antinociceptive e ﬀects whereas the essential oil concentrationof 1% (in the diclofenac sodium gel) resulted in a reduction in pain. The study demonstrated thatthe essential oil is rich in monoterpenoids, especially 1,8-cineole, which are capable of promotingcutaneous absorption [46].3.6. Antifungal TreatmentDermatophytes are the most common agents causing topical mycoses [ 62]. The World HealthOrganization estimates that 20% of the global population is a ﬀected by dermatomycoses [ 63];the prevalence of these diseases tends to increase with age and is dependent on the climate andlocation [64]. R. oﬃcinalis was reported to be active against dermatophytes in vivo [22].The antifungal activity of rosemary essential oil was tested against Candida albicans ,Candida dubliniensis ,Candida parapsilosis , and Candida krusei [47]. Such dermatophytes are the most common agents causing
topical mycoses [ 62]. It was found that an oil concentration of 8% was capable of inhibiting the growthofCandida sp. A similar study evaluated the effect of R. officinalis hydroalcoholic extract against twodermatophytes, Microsporum gypseum and T richophyton rubrum , and showed that a concentration of 10%R. officinalis extract was responsible for 86% inhibition of fungal growth [48].4. Cosmetic Properties4.1. Ginoid Lipodystrophy (GLD, Cellulite)Most postadolescent women have cellulite [ 65,66]. Cellulite is manifested by topographic disordersof subcutaneous tissue, such as nodules, edema, and abnormal ﬁbrosis [67].It is believed that gynoid lipodystrophy (GLD) is a chronic inﬂammatory process in whichadipocyte malfunction causes a higher content of altered lipids to be retained. This increases thecellular volume and compromises blood circulation and the normal physiological state of pregnancy,
after which the mother retains a higher content of lipids to guarantee caloric reserves [68].A cream with extracts of three plants ( Zanthoxylum clava-herculis (containing magnoﬂorineand laurifoline), Annona squamosa (containing squamosin and kaurenoic acid), and Rosmarinus
A cream with extracts of three plants ( Zanthoxylum clava-herculis (containing magnoﬂorineand laurifoline), Annona squamosa (containing squamosin and kaurenoic acid), and Rosmarinusoﬃcinalis (containing carnosic acid)) was examined for its e ﬀects on cellulite in a single-blind,
Plants 2020 ,9, 651 7 of 12randomized controlled study of 44 women between 18 and 59 years or age with mild-to-severecellulite. The formulation led to an improvement in the appearance of the cellulite [36].4.2. AlopeciaAlopecia is characterized by the loss of some or all hair and is classiﬁed as a chronic dermatologicaldisorder [ 69]. The prevalence of alopecia has increased owing to stress and diet-related factors [ 70].Excess testosterone in the blood capillaries is signiﬁcantly associated with this condition; as such,antiandrogenic agents have been reported to reduce hair loss [49].C57BL /6 mice with testosterone-induced alopecia were treated topically with hydroalcoholicextracts of rosemary (2 mg /day/animal) and showed a signiﬁcant increase in hair growth after the16th day of treatment compared with those in the control [ 49]. A hydroalcoholic extract was testedin vitro for the evaluation of 5 αR enzyme activity and showed strong inhibition of the binding of
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to its receptor. An in vitro assay in human prostate LNCaP cells indicatedthat 12-methoxy-sarcosalic acid had a key role in the inhibition of the 5 αR enzyme and DHT /receptorbinding [49].4.3. AntiagingAging is a skin process that occurs owing to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factorsact at the cellular level, whereas extrinsic factors are governed by human behavior, such as chronicexposure to the sun, poor nutrition, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption [ 71]. These internaland external agents lead to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 72]; when ROS levelsexceed the cell’s neutralization capacity, damage to cell constituents occurs, ultimately leading to celldeath [73].A new compound was isolated from the hydrophilic fraction of an aqueous methanol extract andwas named Rosm1. This biomolecule had a strong antioxidant capacity to neutralize ROS, similar to
vitamin E, and was able to inhibit free radical-mediated reactions in vivo and in vitro , protecting lipidsand cell constituents from oxidative stress [8].Lipid nanoparticles have been used to increase the cutaneous permeation of drugs [ 74,75].These nanoparticles were loaded with R. oﬃcinalis essential oil incorporated into a gel and an in vivotest was performed to assess the moisturizing ability of this formulation and any increase in elasticity.The gel containing nanoparticles loaded with rosemary oil showed a greater capacity to hydrate andincrease of the elasticity of skin compared with the gel containing free essential oil [50].Rosmarinic acid was encapsulated within chitosan microparticles. The release proﬁle of theloaded particles was studied in two distinct media: water and coconut oil. A slower release proﬁleobserved in coconut oil was attributed to the lower solubility of the chitosan particles [76].
R. oﬃcinalis extract has strong antioxidant activity, which is mainly attributed to its phenoliccompounds. Antioxidant activity is generally attributed to free radical scavenging, but secondarymetabolites may play a biological role in the regulation of apoptosis, cell signal transduction,and xenobiotic metabolism in the liver [77].4.4. Ultraviolet (UV) ProtectionUVA radiation induces the production of ROS, and UVB is absorbed by molecules such as DNAand proteins, subsequently damaging the cells [78–80].Rosemary extract was tested alone and in combination with citrus extract obtained from grapefruitin vivo and in vitro for its protective e ﬀects against UV irradiation [ 4]. In the in vitro cell viabilitymeasurement using the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide)assay,keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) were treated with the extracts separately and in combination. Then, the cells
were exposed to UV radiation at intensities of 800 and 1200 J /m2. Both extracts increased the viabilityof the keratinocytes. The e ﬀects of a 1:1 mixture of citrus extract and rosemary extract was tested on
of the keratinocytes. The e ﬀects of a 1:1 mixture of citrus extract and rosemary extract was tested oncells exposed to UV radiation; this mixture showed superior e ﬀects on the increase of cell viability
Plants 2020 ,9, 651 8 of 12compared to those of either extract alone, indicating that the polyphenolic compounds of each extracthave di ﬀerent targets for cell protection [4].When irradiated with UV at a dose of 800 J /m2, the citrus and rosemary extracts (50 µg/mLeach) showed 40% and 13% protection against UV light, respectively. When combined (100 µg/mL),70% protection was observed. The synergistic e ﬀect was even greater when 1200 J /m2of radiation wasused. The extracts also had the ability to decrease the formation of free radicals during UV exposure.The study also showed that, when used in combination, the extracts were able to protect DNA fromdamage caused by the formation of free radicals. Oral administration of the combined citrus andR. oﬃcinalis extracts over the course of 8 weeks increased the UV dose required to induce erythema inthe skin [4].When the skin is injured by sun exposure, there is a decrease in type I collagen synthesis and
excessive degradation by enzymes called metalloproteinases (MMPs). It was demonstrated thatrosemary extract inhibits UV-induced metalloproteinase-1, indicating that it may reduce the skindamage caused by sunlight [51].5. Other StudiesThe impact of rosmarinic, ursolic, and oleanolic acids on the stability of multiple water /oil/water(W/O/W) emulsions has been studied. These acids did not have any e ﬀect on the interfacial tensionwhen used as surfactants but were able to improve the stability of these emulsions for a short periodof time. The authors concluded that rosemary extract contained active compounds with cosmeticpotential owing to their various biological activities but that they could also be used as stabilizers,and favored the formation of W /O/W emulsions [52].6. Conclusions and Future PerspectivesRosemary extract contains a large variety of bioactive molecules with great therapeutic potential.
These include triterpenes (e.g., ursolic and oleanolic acid), tricyclic diterpenes (e.g., carnosic acid andcarnosol), phenolic acids (e.g., ca ﬀeic acid and rosmarinic acid), and essential oils. These secondarymetabolites have been formulated in topical dosages. Topical administration strategies avoid ﬁrst-passmetabolism, releasing the drug at the site of action and resulting in a lower risk of side e ﬀects.This strategy can be applied to improve the properties of cosmetic products (e.g., those that combat UVexposure, aging, and cellulite), owing to the anti-inﬂammatory activity and free radical-scavengingeﬀects of Rosmarinus o ﬃcinalis .The use of nanoparticles in the development of new products for topical administration should beexplored further, as they result in the more e ﬀective delivery of molecules to their site of action andincrease treatment adherence. According to the published literature, rosemary has anti-inﬂammatory,
antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties, which have been extensively reported in oral formulations(e.g., toothpaste or formulations to treat infections). The development of new formulations containingrosemary extracts should be encouraged, as their promise as topical agents is well established.Author Contributions: L.M.d.M. wrote the review with help from L.M., and É.M.d.S., L.L.T., J.A.A., E.B.S.,and P .G.M. reviewed the text.
