Strategically regulating MV release may increase drug retention within cancercells and allow for lower doses of chemotherapeutic drugs. The contribution of exosomes to drugretention still remains unknown. Potential exosome and MV (EMV) biogenesis inhibitors, testedon human prostate cancer (PC3) cells for their capacity to inhibit EMV release, were also tested onPC3 and MCF-7 (breast cancer) cells for improving chemotherapy. Agents inhibiting EMV releasemost signiﬁcantly, whilst maintaining cell viability, were chloramidine (Cl-amidine; 50 µM) andbisindolylmaleimide-I (10 µM). Apoptosis mediated by the chemotherapy drug 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU)
was signiﬁcantly enhanced in PC3 cells in the presence of both these EMV inhibitors, resultingin a 62% (Cl-amidine + 5-FU) and 59% (bisindolylmaleimide-I + 5-FU) decrease in numbers ofviable PC3 cells compared to 5-FU alone after 24 h. For MCF-7 cells, there were similar increasedreductions of viable cells compared to 5-FU treatment alone ranging from 67% (Cl-amidine + 5-FU)to 58% (bisindolylmaleimide-I + 5-FU). Using combinatory treatment, the two EMV inhibitors furtherreduced the number of viable cancer cells tested. Neither inhibitor affected cell viability. Combiningselected EMV inhibitors may pose as a novel strategy to enhance the efﬁcacy of chemotherapeuticdrug-mediated apoptosis.Keywords: microvesicles; exosomes; drug retention; prostate cancer; peptidylarginine deiminase;chloramidine; bisindolylmaleimide-I; 5-ﬂuorouracil; multidrug resistance1. IntroductionExosomes and microvesicles (MVs)—also referred to as EMVs—are released from all cell types
and are key mediators of intercellular communication. EMVs comprise exosomes (40–150 nm indiameter), released through exocytosis, and MVs (150–1000 nm in diameter) that bud off directly fromthe plasma membrane [ 1,2]. These vesicles carry lipids and proteins characteristic of their parentalInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2017 ,18, 1007; doi:10.3390/ijms18051007 www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms

Dueto our incomplete understanding, MDR has become a major challenge to effective treatment [ 4]. It isknown that cancer cells use ATP-dependent and an independent efﬂux of various cancer drugs [ 5].Whilst many of the MDR proteins belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family [ 6–8],including MDR protein (MRP), Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP), and P-glycoprotein (P-gp),some, such as lung-resistance related protein (LRP), are not ABC transporters and yet are still involvedin drug uptake [9].EMVs can also transfer P-gp, which is involved in MDR [ 10], and as any change in EMV-mediated
communication is likely to affect MDR [ 11,12], regulation of EMVs provides a putative new strategy toprevent MDR and improve treatment.In cancer chemotherapy, it is essential that the drug be retained within the target cell to improveefﬁcacy. Microvesicle release has been shown to affect drug retention within cancer cells. This isbecause chemotherapeutic drugs stimulate cells to release MVs, which we and others have showncarry these drugs within them [ 12–21]. Inhibition of MV release has been shown [ 12–17] to increaseretention within cells and to sensitize them to chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to measurethe capacity of various candidate EMV inhibitors to inhibit EMV release from prostate cancer cells(PC3). Following previous work in our lab, in which MV inhibitors calpeptin and chloramidine(Cl-amidine) rendered PC3 cells more sensitive to chemotherapy, in the same vein we tried some of
the new inhibitors as well as combinations of these inhibitors (some of which also inhibited exosomerelease) in experiments using 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU).2. Results2.1. Cl-amidine, Bisindolylmaleimide-I, and Imipramine Effectively Inhibit Exosome and Microvesicle (EMV)Release from PC3 CellsEMVs were collected from cells after 24 h and analysed by nanoparticle tracking analysis NTA(Figure 1A). The vesicles collected at 25,000 ×gwere conﬁrmed (Figure 1B) to comprise EMVs byseparate isolation of MVs (centrifugation at 10,000 ×g) and of exosomes (100,000 ×g) as determined byelectron microscopy (MVs ≥150 nm; exosomes ≤150 nm), by the expression of CD63 (negligible inMVs, strong in exosomes), and by a higher PS exposition in MVs compared to exosomes. Cells werethen treated with a range of pharmacological agents and EMV counts determined by NTA analysis(Figures 1C–E and 2A). A Guava ViaCount assay showed that the viability of cells was maintained
throughout, except with D-pantethine, which reduced viability by almost 80% (Figure 2B). Cl-amidine(50µM) and bisindolylmaleimide-I (10 µM) gave the maximum inhibition of EMV release resulting in87% and 90% inhibition, respectively. Imipramine was also found to be a potent EMV inhibitor, causinga 77% reduction in EMV count (Figure 2A). All the remaining reagents tested, except for glyburide,also resulted in a signiﬁcant inhibition. This suggests that these inhibitors are able to inhibit a range ofdifferent pathways of EMV biogenesis and might therefore be used individually or in combination todevelop more potent EMV inhibiting strategies.Having revealed several reagents that inhibit the total number of EMVs released from PC3 prostatecells, the NTA data was further analysed, based on size exclusion, to verify whether the inhibitiondetected was equal for typically exosome-sized vesicles ( ≤150 nm) and for typically MV-sized vesicles
(≥150 nm). M βCD, a commonly used endocytosis inhibitor, reduced the number of exosome-sizedvesicles compared to the untreated control by 58% and exclusively affected vesicles in this size range,
(≥150 nm). M βCD, a commonly used endocytosis inhibitor, reduced the number of exosome-sizedvesicles compared to the untreated control by 58% and exclusively affected vesicles in this size range,with numbers of MV-sized vesicles barely changing compared to the control (Figure 3A,B, red stars).In contrast, Y27632, which reduced the number of MV-sized vesicles by 67%, only had a minimaleffect (3% reduction) on exosome-sized vesicles (Figure 3A,B; red stars). Bisindolylmaleimide-I,Cl-amidine, and imipramine caused signiﬁcant reductions of both ≤150-nm- and≥150-nm-sized

It was noteworthy, therefore, that, according to particlesize analysis, the most effective inhibitors of EMV release, bisindolylmaleimide-I, Cl-amidine (andimipramine) reduced numbers of both MVs and exosomes; while this was not the case with Y27632,calpeptin, M βCD, cytochalasin D, and chlorpromazine, which showed a speciﬁc tendency to reduceonly one vesicle subtype.Int.

DiscussionThis study reveals a range of pharmacological agents that can effectively inhibit the release ofcellular EMVs, selectively affecting a range of pathways for EMV biosynthesis. All the prospectiveinhibitors of EMV release tested, bar glyburide, resulted in a clear EMV inhibition. The ﬁrst inhibitor,EGTA, is a calcium chelator. In the case of cells stimulated to take up Ca2+, for example, through
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017 ,18, 1007 6 of 12stimulation of P2X 7receptors with BzATP , EGTA may result in a decrease in intracellular Ca2+, thuspreventing EMV release [ 22]. The second inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide-I, is a protein kinase C (PKC)inhibitor preventing the externalisation of phosphatidylserine (PS) [ 23], which is a known mechanismthat drives EMV release. The third inhibitor, imipramine, is an inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinaseaSMase. Upon activation of the ATP receptor P2X 7, MV shedding is associated with rapid activationand translocation of aSMase to the outer leaﬂet of the plasma membrane [ 24]. The fourth inhibitor,D-pantethine, blocks the translocation of phosphatidylserine [ 25], resulting in the non-externalisationof PS and therefore the inhibition of microvesiculation [ 26].D-pantethine has been shown to reducevesicle formation in mice infected with malaria compared to that of non-pantethine treated mice [ 27,28].
As it inhibits MV release, it so prevents systemic sclerosis in mice, as does knocking out the ABCA1gene [ 29]. The most effective inhibitor in this study, Cl-amidine, affects peptidylarginine deiminaseactivation, which causes post-translational protein deimination. We have previously described a novelpathway of MV biogenesis involving increased PAD-mediated protein deimination of cytoskeletalactin and nuclear translocation of PADs during microvesiculation [ 30,31]. Our current study conﬁrmsthe effectivity of pharmacological PAD inhibition using Cl-amidine for signiﬁcantly reduced cellularEMV release, targeting both MVs as well as demonstrating a novel inhibitory effect on exosome release.The sixth inhibitor, Y27632, is an inhibitor of Rho A. Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinases(ROCK) are effectors of the small GTPase Rho-kinase, which amongst its myriad functions inﬂuences
the redistribution of actin-cytoskeletal changes and regulates apoptosis-induced EMV release [ 32].Inhibition by Y27632 prevents the activation of Rho A, which in turn abrogates EMV biogenesis [ 33].The seventh inhibitor, calpeptin, is cell-permeable and inhibits calpain [ 34–36], even in the prostatecancer cell, PC3 [ 37], and reduces MV release from human embryonic kidney cells damaged withthe streptococcal haemolytic exotoxin, streptolysin O [ 38]. The eighth inhibitor, glyburide, is anotherinhibitor of the ATP-binding cassette transporter and therefore a potential MV inhibitor [ 26], althoughin this study we found it to have no effect on EMV release. The ninth inhibitor tested, cytochalasinD, disrupts actin ﬁlaments of the cytoskeleton [ 39], speciﬁcally inhibiting actin polymerization, andit is suspected that, by modulating membrane trafﬁcking [ 39], this may inhibit exosome release, as
observed from HeLa cells [ 40]. Our data, however, indicated only a small reduction in exosome-sizedvesicles and an increase in MV-sized vesicles. As expected, of the two endocytosis inhibitors used, bothchlorpromazine, a cationic amphipathic drug, and M βCD, which depletes the cell plasma membraneof cholesterol [41], exclusively inhibited the release of exosome-sized vesicles.In summary, Cl-amidine, and bisindolylmaleimide-I gave the highest inhibition of EMV releasefollowed by imipramine and D-pantethine as detected by NanoSight analysis (Figures 1 and 2A).However, D-pantethine signiﬁcantly affected cell viability, which was found to be only 25% after 24 h(Figure 2B). Therefore, we chose to use Cl-amidine and bisindolylmaleimide-I, either individually orin combination, to inhibit EMV release in further experiments. Neither of these affected cell viability,indicating that inhibition of EMV release per se did not increase apoptosis.
Recently, we described a novel mechanism for PAD-mediated MV release. Speciﬁcally, thiswork showed that pan-PAD inhibitor Cl-amidine, inhibits MV release [ 37]. Here, we have further
Recently, we described a novel mechanism for PAD-mediated MV release. Speciﬁcally, thiswork showed that pan-PAD inhibitor Cl-amidine, inhibits MV release [ 37]. Here, we have furthershown that, compared to other EMV inhibitors, Cl-amidine is very potent, inhibiting not only MVbut also exosomal release (i.e., EMVs). Our data suggests that, rather than using sole EMV inhibitors,a combination of EMV inhibitors may be the way forward in enhancing the anti-neoplastic effect ofpharmacological reagents. As demonstrated here in the PC3 prostate cancer and MCF-7 breast cancercell lines, the percentage of viable cells was signiﬁcantly lower when 5-FU treatment was carried out inthe presence of Cl-amidine and the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide-I, compared to treatment with5-FU alone, after only 24 h. While our results clearly indicate that we have also targeted inhibitionof exosome release, this is currently based on size exclusion alone and will be followed up in our
continuing studies using selective marker analysis.Bisindolylmaleimide-I and Cl-amidine are likely to have multi-faceted effects on cells.As discussed by Pajak et al. [ 42], bisindolylmaleimide-I’s role as an anti-cancer therapeutic could
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017 ,18, 1007 7 of 12include PKC-dependent and independent effects. These may include modulation of Wnt signalling,elimination of anti-apoptotic proteins, induction of intrinsic apoptosis, and reversal of MDR throughrestoration of sensitivity to chemotherapy, by inhibiting P-gp 1 (multidrug resistance protein 1- orABCB1-) mediated drug efﬂux [ 42]. In the same vein, Cl-amidine will inhibit deimination of variousknown and unknown target proteins in the cell, including cytoskeletal actin and nuclear proteins suchas histones via PAD nuclear translocation—which we have previously shown to be involved in MVbiogenesis [37]. However, although in theory we cannot at present rule out possible off-target effects,neither EMV inhibitor on its own affected cell viability in the two cancer cell lines tested or at theconcentrations used in this study.Our previous work, using the calpain inhibitor calpeptin in the presence of 5-FU and docetaxel
on prostate cancer cells, PC3, generated promising ﬁndings where combination therapy reducedthe dose of docetaxel by 100-fold needed to produce comparable reduction in tumour volumein vivo [14]. We went on to show that methotrexate is released from cancer cells within MVs [ 14]. Thatchemotherapeutic drugs can be released within both exosomes and MVs has been well establishedby many other groups [ 12–21]. As our current work has shown several EMV inhibitors includingCl-amidine, bisindolylmaleimide-I and imipramine to be more potent even than calpeptin, this bodeswell for future targeted combination therapy. Although all the inhibitors tested affected the numberof EMVs released, methyl- β-cyclodextrin, inhibited exosome release only and Y27632 inhibited MVrelease alone. For future work, it would be interesting to assess the relative contribution of inhibitingeither MV or exosome release on any sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapy. It should be
noted that as well as possibly inﬂuencing retention of chemotherapeutic drugs within cancer cells,EMVs may also transfer proteins involved in MDR such as P-gp [ 10]. Clearly therefore regulation andmanipulation of EMV release is an important consideration to improving chemotherapy.As the expanded repertoire of EMV inhibiting agents revealed in this study may also havethe potential to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy, they must be further tested in vitro andin vivo , individually and in combination, taking advantage of their inhibitory effects on different EMVbiosynthesis pathways. To increase the potency of chemotherapy further and effectively inhibit MDR,those EMV inhibitors that inhibit both exosomes and MVs will be of priority. Combination therapyinvolving selective EMV inhibitors may encourage re-testing of chemotherapeutic drugs currently notin favour due to severe side-effects and poor effectivity (such as 5-FU treatment of prostate cancer [ 43]).
Additionally, looking ahead to the development of future in vivo experiments it is useful that nopre-treatment with the EMV-inhibiting drugs was needed to enhance the chemotherapeutic effect.4.

Sci. 2017 ,18, 1007 8 of 12ether)- N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; Sigma-Aldrich) (1.5 mM), bisindolylmaleimide-I (10 µM; MerckMillipore), imipramine (25 µM; Sigma-Aldrich), D-pantethine (1 mM; Sigma-Aldrich), Cl-amidine(50µM; provided by P .R.Thompson), Y27632 (1 µM; Sigma-Aldrich), calpeptin (25 µM; Sigma-Aldrich),glyburide (10 µM; Sigma-Aldrich), M βCD (10 µM; Sigma-Aldrich), cytochalasin D (10 µM;Sigma-Aldrich), and chlorpromazine (10 µM; Sigma-Aldrich) were added separately and incubatedfor 24 h at 37◦C/5% CO 2. EMVs released were isolated (4.4) and counted (4.5).4.3. The Effect of EMV Inhibitors on 5-FU-Mediated Apoptosis of PC3 and MCF-7 CellsCombinations of EMV inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide-I and Cl-amidine were used to test fora synergistic enhancement of the anti-cancer drug, 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU; Sigma-Aldrich). PC3 andMCF-7 cells were maintained as before and seeded in triplicate at 3.8 ×105cells/well in 12-well
microtitre plates with pre-warmed RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich). They were treated, either separatelyor in combination, with 10 µM bisindolylmaleimide-I and 50 µM Cl-amidine and at the same timewith 1 µM 5-FU; control cells were treated with 1 µM 5-FU only. After 24 h, a cell death assay(Guava ViaCount, Merck Millipore) was performed using the Guava EasyCyte 8HT ﬂow cytometer(Merck Millipore).4.4. Isolation of EMVsEMVs were isolated from the cell culture supernatant by centrifuging once at 200 ×g/5 min toremove cells. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 4000 ×g/60 min at 4◦C to remove cell debrisand the new supernatant again at 25,000 ×g/1 h/4◦C. The isolated EMV pellet was resuspendedin sterile-ﬁltered (0.22 µm) EMV-free DPBS and centrifuged again at 25,000 ×g/1 h/4◦C to removeproteins possibly bound to the EMV surface (such as albumin). The EMV pellet was resuspended insterile-ﬁltered EMV-free DPBS and quantiﬁed by nanoparticle tracking analysis as described below
(4.5). Isolated EMVs were used immediately.The EMV pellet could then be centrifuged at 11,000 ×gfor 30 min at 4◦C using a Beckman-CoulterType 60 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, High Wycombe, UK) to separate microvesicles(MVs) and the resultant supernatant then centrifuged at 100,000 ×gfor 1 h at 4◦C using the samerotor to isolate exosomes. Microvesicles and exosomes were characterised by ﬂow cytometry forAnnexin V-FITC (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) binding as a measure of phosphatidylserine exposition bytransmission electron microscopy as described elsewhere [ 44] and by Western blotting for the exosomemarker (CD63, Abcam) as previously described [31].4.5. Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA, NanoSight LM10) of EMVsSamples were diluted 1:50 using sterile-ﬁltered, EMV-free DPBS, and the minimum concentrationof samples was set as 5 ×107particles/mL. The settings at capturing stage were 8 and 13 for screen and
camera gain respectively and at the process stage set at 9 and 3 for screen gain and detection threshold,respectively, as according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK).4.6. Flow Cytometry and Guava ViaCount Assay of EMVsThe Guava EasyCyte 8HT ﬂow cytometer (Merck Millipore) and ViaCount assay (Merck Millipore)were used to count and determine viability of cells treated with EMV inhibitors, as previouslydescribed [ 45]. Brieﬂy, the ViaCount assay distinguishes between viable and non-viable cells basedon the differential permeability of two DNA-binding dyes in the Guava ViaCount reagent (MerckMillipore). The nuclear dye only stained nucleated cells, while the viability dye brightly stainednecrotic or apoptotic cells.
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017 ,18, 1007 9 of 124.7. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 6 (GraphPad Software,San Diego , CA, USA). Experiments were performed three times in triplicate. A one-way ANOVAwas performed with Tukey’s post-hoc analysis. Differences were considered signiﬁcant for p≤0.05(*p≤0.05; ** p≤0.01; *** p≤0.001; **** p≤0.0001).5. ConclusionsThis study emphasises the signiﬁcance of EMV inhibitors in increasing the effectiveness ofchemotherapy. Careful selection and combination of EMV inhibitors, targeting different EMVbiogenesis pathways that inﬂuence exosome as well as MV release, can signiﬁcantly enhance theeffectiveness of anti-cancer drugs. The results presented in prostate and breast cancer cell linesencourage further testing in other types of cancer. Targeted prevention of possible EMV-mediateddrug removal is likely to improve the efﬁcacy of a range of drugs and thus poses a promising strategy
