IntroductionExosomes are biological nano-sized vesicles ( ∼30–200 nm in dia-meter) that are produced by a wide range of cells and contain surfacereceptors, cytoplasmic components, RNAs, miRNAs, and DNAs of pro-ducing cells. They play many roles in cell-cell communications inphysiological and pathological processes such as antigen presentationor cellular communications which modulate cellular activities in re-cipient cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the ideal producers of
exosomes ( Ratajczak et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008; van Dommelenet al., 2012; Harding et al., 2013; Raposo and Stoorvogel, 2013 ). Re-cently, exosomes are considered as the vehicle of the therapeutic agents(nucleic acid or drug) due to their special features including low im-munogenicity, ability to cross physiological barriers, great biodis-tribution and biological compatibilities ( Munson and Shukla, 2015;Zhang et al., 2015; Agrahari et al., 2016 ). Currently, dendritic cell (DC)-derived exosomes are in phase 2 clinical trial for the melanoma treat-ment and phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced non-small celllung cancer ( Escudier et al., 2005; Morse et al., 2005). Due to theirintrinsic therapeutic e ﬀects, di ﬀerent engineered exosomes have beendesigned ( Wiklander et al., 2015 ). In one study, exosomes isolated fromdendritic cells were transfected with rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG)and used to deliver siRNAs that silence BACE1 expression in brain.
BACE1 is a protease responsible for N-terminal cleavage of the amyloidprecursor protein that produces the aggregate-forming β-amyloid pep-tide. Consequently, they con ﬁrmed the ability of exosomes to pass theblood brain barrier following systemic injection and to produce a sig-niﬁcant decrease in BACE1 mRNA levels ( Alvarez-Erviti et al., 2011 ).Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells with ther-apeutic potential in regenerative medicine. They have several excitingcapabilities such as migration to the tumor tissues and in ﬂamed sites,convenient isolation, good in vitro proliferation and ideal producer ofexosomes ( Ren et al., 2018; Lai et al., 2013; Hong et al., 2014). Despitethe relatively bene ﬁcial result of using MSCs in regenerative medicine,MSCs therapy in cancer ﬁeld is very controversial. Some ﬁndings im-plicated MSCs in the promotion of tumor growth and metastasis bytheir immune modulatory properties. On the other hand, some studies
promised the use of MSCs in anti-cancer therapy and some evidences
plicated MSCs in the promotion of tumor growth and metastasis bytheir immune modulatory properties. On the other hand, some studiespromised the use of MSCs in anti-cancer therapy and some evidencessuggested that therapeutic e ﬀects of MSCs may be due to their para-crine action ( Gnecchi et al., 2008 ). Exosomes are an e ﬀective part ofthis secretome with great features including inherent homing ability tothe tumor site and injured tissues and the delivery of multiple signals invivo. Thus, MSC-derived exosomes represent a promising tool for bothcell-free therapy and biological drug delivery ( Baglio et al., 2012; Laiet al., 2013). MSC-derived exosomes have been utilized for delivery ofpaclitaxel which indicated a strong anti-proliferative e ﬀect on humanpancreatic adenocarcinoma cells ( Pascucci et al., 2014 ). In anotherstudy, delivery of anti-miR-9 by MSC-derived exosomes reversed thechemosensitivity of glioblastoma multiform cells ( Munoz et al., 2015).
Intratumor injection of exosomes derived from miR-122-expressingMSCs led to a dramatic increase in anti-tumor e ﬃciency of sorafeniband enhanced the chemosensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma in vivo(Lou et al., 2015 ).Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, TRAIL, is anovel agent for cancer treatment. It is shown that TRAIL induces se-lective apoptosis in a wide range of cancer cells without toxic e ﬀect onnormal cells. It has also been demonstrated that TRAIL is a promisingcancer therapeutic agent in preclinical studies. However, formulationscontaining recombinant TRAIL faced some challenges which have to beconsidered for use in human including low circulation half-life, poorhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2018.07.067Received 11 April 2018; Received in revised form 24 July 2018; Accepted 30 July 2018⁎Corresponding authors at: Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.

stability after systemic injection, and ineﬃ cient delivery to target sites.Despite interesting results reported on the anti-tumor e ﬀect of TRAIL invitro, no convincing antitumor activity was reported in animal study(Rivoltini et al., 2016). In order to design an appropriate system, someinsuﬃciencies such as short half-life, inadequate delivery methods, andTRAIL-resistant cancer cell populations should be considered ( Stuckeyand Shah, 2013). Several formulations of recombinant TRAIL, combi-nation therapy with di ﬀerent anticancer drugs and various deliverysystems including liposomes, mesenchymal stem cells and exosomeshave been exploited to enhance the TRAIL half-life and sensitivity tocancer cells. Mueller et al. used genetically engineered TRAIL-expres-sing MSCs for their possible anti-tumor activity. They demonstratedthat MSC-TRAIL could e ﬀectively induce apoptosis in sensitive ad-vanced colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells in vitro and also inhibit tumor
growth in animal model. Furthermore, they hypothesized that MSC-TRAIL could induce apoptosis in advanced CRC cells, which are re-sistant to apoptosis induced by soluble TRAIL. Their data proved thatMSC-TRAIL could inhibit the growth of some TRAIL-resistant CRC cells(HCT8 cells) in vitro and in vivo . However other tumor cells includingHT-29 cells remained resistant to MSC-TRAIL even after co-delivery ofMSC-TRAIL and 5- ﬂuorouracil (5-FU). Furthermore, xenograft tumorcells growth was enhanced in vivo (Mueller et al., 2011 ). In anotherstudy, De Miguel et al. have shown that liposome-bound TRAIL greatlyincreased its bioactivity in comparison to soluble TRAIL and inducedapoptosis in leukemic cells ( De Miguel et al., 2015 ).It has been shown that intratumoral injection of exosomes obtainedfrom K562 cells which were transfected with lentiviral human mem-brane TRAIL, indicated anti-tumor e ﬀect in TRAIL-death receptor5
positive cells ( Rivoltini et al., 2016). In another study reported by Yuanet al. high e ﬃciency of cancer cell killing with Exo-TRAIL was de-scribed. They showed that exosome derived from MSC-TRAIL werecapable of inducing e ﬀective apoptosis (70% ± 28%) in a wide rangeof cancer cell lines including lung adenocarcinoma, primary normalhuman bronchial epithelial cells, renal cancer cell, breast adenocarci-noma and neuroblastoma cell lines in vitro .(Yuan et al., 2017 ). Fur-thermore, some evidence con ﬁrmed that low pH condition of tumormicroenvironment potentially in ﬂuenced on exosome traﬃ cking anduptake by cancer cells ( Parolini et al., 2009 ).In our previous study, pyridine-modi ﬁed polyethylenimine as anovel non-viral vector was synthesized and selected for delivery of GFP-encoding plasmid to MSCs ( Salmasi et al., 2015).In the current study,we transfected bone marrow-derived MSCs with polyplex comprisingPEI25Pyr 50%and plasmid encoding TRAIL-GFP with high e ﬃciency.
Then, exosomes containing TRAIL protein (Exo-TRAIL) were isolatedfrom the supernatant of genetically engineered MSCs (MSC-TRAIL)using Exoquick TC kit. Antitumor activity of both MSC-derived exo-somes and Exo-TRAIL was further investigated in vitro and in vivo.2. Materials and methods2.1.

B16F0 celllines were obtained from Pasteur Institute, Iran.2.2. Methods2.2.1. Cell culture and transfectionB16F0 mouse melanoma cells (ATCC CRL-6322) were cultured inhigh glucose DMEM were supplemented with heat-inactivated fetalbovine serum (FBS, 10% v/v), penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin(100 µg/ml).The murine bone marrow-derived MSCs were isolated from C57BL/6 mice marrow and cultured in low glucose DMEM supplemented with
7.5% heat-inactivated FBS, 7.5% horse serum, 2 mM glutamine, peni-cillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 µg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidi ﬁedatmosphere containing 5% CO2. MSCs were transfected withPEI25Pyr50%as a non-viral vector for transferring TRAIL/GFP encodingplasmid. The transfection procedure was performed as described pre-viously ( Salmasi et al., 2015).2.2.2. Exosome isolation and characterization2.2.2.1. Exosome isolation . MSCs and TRAIL-engineered MSCs (MSC-TRAIL) were cultured until they reached 70% con ﬂuency. Then, thesupernatant was discarded; cells were washed with PBS and culturedfor 72 h in low glucose DMEM supplemented with depleted exosomeFBS (10%) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 U/ml, 100 µg/ml). Toeliminate debris and micro-vesicles, the recovered condition mediumfrom each group was ﬁltered through 0.22 µm pore size membrane byvacuum ﬁlter and subjected to three continuous centrifugations at 300 g
(10 min), 1200 g (30 min), and 10000 g (45 min). Then, the clearedcondition media were concentrated by using 100 kDa Amicon ﬁlter andexosomes were isolated with Exoquick TC kit according to themanufacturer's protocol. Brie ﬂy, the condition medium was mixedwith Exoquick TC precipitation reagent at the ratio of 1:5, mixed wellby inverting or ﬂicking the tube and ﬁnally incubated overnight at 4 °C.Then, it was centrifuged at 1500 g for 30 min; the supernatant wasremoved followed by an additional centrifugation at 1500 g for 5 minand the removal of the supernatant. The pelleted exosomes wereresuspended in an appropriate bu ﬀer. BCA assay was employed(Thermo Scienti ﬁc Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit) to determine theprotein content and the exosome isolation yield ( Lobb et al., 2015 ).2.2.2.2. Characterization of exosome2.2.2.2.1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Sizemeasurement . Isolated exosomes were diluted in PBS and ﬁxed with
10% paraformaldehyde. The diluted exosomes (10 –20 µl) weredeposited directly onto carbon tape on aluminum stubs and the stubswere allowed to dry overnight. The sample was coated with goldcoating (Quorum-Q150R) for 300 s and imaging was performed with FeSEM (TESCAN MIRA3, Czech) ( Lai et al., 2016 ).The exosomes size was measured by using dynamic light scattering.Brieﬂy, exosomes (1 μg) were resuspended in 1mL ﬁltered PBS at pH7.4. The size of particles was analyzed by DLS Nano sizer (Nano-ZS;Malvern, UK).2.2.2.2.2. Flow cytometry and analysis of exosome markers . Thirty μgof the exosomes (total protein) were incubated in a 100 μl volume 4 µmaldehyde/sulfate latex beads at room temperature (RT) for 15 min.Then, 900 μl of PBS was added to the mixture and incubated at RT foradditional 3 h. Thereafter, the coupling reaction was terminated byaddition of 100 mM glycine and centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min at RT.Then, the beads were washed three times by resuspending them in 5 ml
of PBS and centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min. The beads were stainedwithﬂuorescein-conjugated antibodies speci ﬁc for exosomal membrane
of PBS and centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min. The beads were stainedwithﬂuorescein-conjugated antibodies speci ﬁc for exosomal membranemarkers, CD9, CD63, and TRAIL, or appropriate isotype control and themixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. In order to evaluate the presenceof TRAIL on exosomes conjugated to beads, a primary antibody speci ﬁcF.H. Shamili et al. International Journal of Pharmaceutics 549 (2018) 218–229219
for TRAIL was used and the mixture was washed three times followedby incubation with ﬂuorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (AlexaFluor ®568) at 4 °C for 1 h. Then, beads were washed three times withPBS and centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min. Next, the stained beads wereresuspended in 100 μl of FACS bu ﬀer and analyzed by FACS Caliburﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, California, USA). The data wereanalyzed using FlowJo Software ( El-Andaloussi et al., 2012 ).2.2.2.2.3. Western Blot Analysis . Protein content of MSC-TRAIL andExo–TRAIL were analyzed for TRAIL detection by Western blot analysis.MSC-TRAIL were lysed in lysis bu ﬀer containing Tris –HCl (50 mM, pH7.4), NaCl (150 mM), Triton-X 100 (1%, w/v), EDTA (1 mM), SDS(0.2% w/v), protease inhibitor cocktail (1%, w/v), phosphataseinhibitor cocktail (1%, w/v), and phenyl methyl sulphonyl ﬂuoride
(PMSF) (1 mM). Then, 20 µg of total protein of either Exo-TRAIL or celllysate were added to the 5X Laemmli bu ﬀer and boiled at 95 °C for5 min. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-acrylamide gel andtransferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, USA). Membranes wereblotted with primary anti-TRAIL antibody (1:1000, rabbit polyclonalantibody, Abcam, UK) and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondaryantibodies (Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L (HRP) 1:3000, Abcam) andvisualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Signal West DuraExtended Duration Substrate, Pierce).2.3. 3 Exosome uptake by B16F0 cellsThe puriﬁ ed vesicles were incubated in PBS containing a lipophilicdye, DiI (5 μM) at 37 °C for 1 h in dark. To eliminate the unincorporateddyes, the mixture was washed twice with PBS by using Amicon 100 kDaultra-ﬁltration membrane ( Yan et al., 2017). The amount of exosomalprotein was measured using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit. B16F0cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 10
4cells/well onto 6-well plates.As the cells reached 70% con ﬂuency, 200 µg of labeled exosomes wereadded to each well and incubated overnight at 37 °C. PBS was used as acontrol. Cellular uptake was evaluated using ﬂuorescence microscopyandﬂow cytometry ( Ekström et al., 2013 ).2.3.1. MTT assayColorimetric cell proliferation was quantiﬁ ed by MTT assay. B16F0cells were seeded at a density of 2500 cells/well onto 96-well plates.Either exosomes or Exo-TRAIL were suspended in PBS. Each well wastreated with 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 µg exosome and Exo –TRAIL, re-spectively and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Twenty µl of MTT solution(0.5 mg/mL) was added to each well. After 4 h of incubation, themedium was removed and 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide was added tothe wells. The plate was shaken gently and the absorbance was mea-sured at 570/630 nm using a Micro plate Reader (TECAN in ﬁnite M200,
Switzerland). The amount of cytotoxicity was calculated using the fol-lowing formula (OD test/ OD control) × 100, where “control ”is ab-sorbance (OD) value obtained in the wells without exosome and “test”is OD value obtained in the wells containing either exosome or Exo-TRAIL. Data were presented as means of triplicates ± SD.2.3.2. In vitro evaluation of apoptosis induction in B16F0 cellsTo study the induction of apoptosis in target B16F0, Annexin V+/PI+ assay was employed. B16F0 cells were cultured at a density of1×1 06cells/well in a 12-well plate. Each well was treated with 200 µgof either exosome or Exo –TRAIL, and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.Apoptosis was evaluated by ﬂow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BectonDickinson) using FITC-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iiodide kit(eBioscience, USA). The percentage of cell death by apoptosis was as-sessed by means of ﬂow cytometry. Annexin V+/PI- cells were con-
sidered to be apoptotic; Annexin V+/PI+ cells were considered to bedead cell, while Annexin V −/PI- cells were considered live cells.2.3.3. Animal imaging and biodistribution of 99mTc-HMPAO-labeledexosomesHexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) was labeled with 5
exosomesHexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) was labeled with 5mCi (185 MBq) of Technetium-99m in 1 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution(from Generator99Mo-99mTc, Pars-Isotope, Iran), mixed for 10 s andincubated for 5 min. Then99mTc-HMPAO was immediately added toexosomes (400 µg/100 μl) and incubated at RT for 30 min. The tube wasgently shaken until the end of labeling procedure. The mixture waswashed twice with 0.9% w/v NaCl by using a 3000 KD Amicon UltraCentrifugal Filter at 750 g for 10 min at RT. The radiochemical puritywas measured by thin-layer chromatography (ITLC) using Whatmanno.1 paper and 0.9% w/v NaCl solution as an eluent. Radiochemicalpurity was determined by cutting the paper in triple and counting inGamma counter. Then labeling purity was calculated by the followingformula:−−+−×( Tc HMPAOexoxomesactivity)/(99mTc HMPAOexoxomesactivityFree Tc HMPAO) 10099m99mThereafter, 8 week-old tumor bearing female mice (400 mm3tumor
volume) were selected for biodistribution study. Cell culture and tumorinduction were carried out as previously described ( Nikpoor et al.,2015 ). 124 µCi labeled exosome with99mTc-HMPAO was injected intothe tail vein (n = 4) and serial planar scans were acquired at 1 h, 3 h,and 6 h on a Siemens Dual head Gamma Camera equipped with a lowenergy high-resolution collimator and peaked at 140 keV with ± 20%window. Images were acquired using a 256 × 256 matrix for a total of300,000 counts. The animal was anesthetized with a mixture of xyla-zine (7.5 mg/kg) and ketamine (60 mg/kg) and placed on the anteriorand posterior position.Forex vivo biodistribution analysis, mice were sacri ﬁced after 6 hpost administration of99mTc-HMPAO-labeled exosomes. The blood wascollected and organs of interest including muscle, heart, lungs, spleen,kidneys, liver, stomach, intestine, bone and tail were dissected,weighed and counted for99mTc- HMPAO-exosome activity in a well
99mTc- HMPAO-exosome activity in a wellgamma counter (Delshid, DL100). The percent injected dose per gramwas calculated by dividing the accumulated activity in the organ to itsweight (%ID/g, injected dose per gram organ) ( Choi et al., 2015; Sadriet al., 2015 ).2.3.4. In vivo study6-8 weeks old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from thePasteur Institute (Tehran, Iran). They were kept under standard con-ditions according to Research Advisory Committee of MashhadUniversity of Medical Sciences. To investigate the e ﬀect of exosomesand Exo-TRAIL on tumor growth in vivo, we designed three models ofadministration in mouse melanoma: co-delivery, single dose non-co-delivery and multi-dose non-codelivery models. To establish sub-cutaneous melanoma models, 3 × 105B16F0 cells were suspended in0.2 ml PBS and injected into the left ﬂank of the mice using a 31 gaugeneedle (day 0). In co-delivery study, B16F0 cells were injected con-
currently with either 250 μg exosome or 250 μg Exo-TRAIL in 0.2 mlPBS to each mouse. In single dose non-codelivery model, 10 days aftertumor inoculation when tumor was palpable, 250 μg of either exosomeor Exo-TRAIL was injected through the tail vein. For multi-dose non-codelivery study, the same procedure was carried out but the injectionwas repeated three times with three days intervals.Tumor size was measured every 2-3 days for length (L), width (W)and depth (D) using a vernier caliper (Electronic digital caliper) and thevolume was calculated by using the formula V = L × W × D × 3.14/6.The body weight and general clinical condition of the animals were alsorecorded during this period.Mice were euthanized when they had the following conditions: (1)they lost body weight more than 20% of initial weight, (2) tumor wasgreater than 2 cm in one dimensions; (3) they became ill and unable to
feed, or moribund. The time to reach end point (TTE) for eachF.H. Shamili et al. International Journal of Pharmaceutics 549 (2018) 218–229220
experiment was calculated based on the equation of the line obtainedby exponential regression of the tumor growth curve. The percent oftumor growth delay (%TGD) was computed based on the di ﬀerencebetween the mean TTE of the treatment group (T) and the mean TTE ofthe control group (C) using the following equation: %TGD = (T −C)/C × 100. Percentage of increase in life span (%ILS) for each treatmentgroup was calculated based on the following equation: (mean survivaltime of treated group/mean survival time of controlgroup × 100) −100. Animals were followed until 2 weeks after the lasttreatment and at the end of study, mice were sacri ﬁced and the tumorswere removed and ﬁxed in 10% paraformaldehyde and processed for H&E staining ( Arabi et al., 2015; Alibolandi et al., 2017 ).2.3.5. Statistical analysisThe statistical signi ﬁcance was determined using the Graph padprism 6 software. The data of survival were analysed by the log-rank
test (Mantel-Cox). For other comparisons, anlysis of variance (ANOVA)was performed. Thereafter, for the signi ﬁcance of di ﬀerence amonggroups, post hoc test performed and pvalue was determined. Pvalues of≤0.05 were considered signi ﬁcant. Results are reported as themean ± SD.3. Results3.1. Isolation and characterization of MSCs-derived exosomesThe exosomes were isolated from both MSCs and MSC-TRAIL usingthe commercial precipitation method. Isolated exosomes were visua-lized under FESEM microscope which revealed their small roundshaped morphology. The size of vesicles measured by DLS was 71.9 nm(Fig. 1A and B). For further characterization, we analyzed the presenceof CD63 and CD9 protein markers on the surface of the exosomes byﬂow cytometry. The results indicated that both markers were presenton the isolated exosomes ( Fig. 1C and D). Subsequently, TRAIL ex-
pression in both transfected MSC-TRAIL and isolated exosomes fromMSC-TRAIL (Exo-TRAIL) was evaluated. Our result by ﬂuorescent mi-croscopic examination revealed dominant ﬂuorescent signal indicatingTRAIL/GFP positive transfected MSC and successful transfection pro-cedure ( Fig. 1E). Moreover, the results of Western blot analysis de-monstrated the expression of TRAIL in both MSC-TRAIL and their se-creted exosomes (Exo-TRAIL). TRAIL present in EXO-TRAIL wasresolved as a protein band at ∼70 KD, which potentially matches to ahexameric form of TRAIL. By contrast, MSC lysate showed a ∼40 KDband which is consistent with what has been reported previously(Fig. 1F) ( Stenqvist et al., 2013; De Miguel et al., 2016; Yuan et al.,2017 ). Additionally, the presence of TRAIL and CD9 on Exo-TRAIL wasconﬁrmed by ﬂow cytometry ( Fig. 1G).3.2. Exosome uptake by B16F0 cellsThe results of the uptake study revealed that MSC-derived exosomes
were taken up by B16F0 cells in 16 h post incubation ( Fig. 2A –C).Moreover, to con ﬁrmthe results of the uptake study, we subsequentlyscraped the cells and performed ﬂow cytometric analysis to comparethe results with those from the control group. As it is shown in Fig. 2D(n = 2), 38% ± 3.5% of the B16F0 cells were positive for the DiI.There is a right shift of MFI (mean ﬂuorescent intensity) in B16F0 cellscompared to the control. The results obtained by the ﬂuorescent mi-croscope were further con ﬁrmed by ﬂow cytometric results ( Fig 2D).3.3. In vitro evaluation of antitumor activity of exosomesTo determine the cytotoxic e ﬀects of either MSC-derived exosomesor Exo-TRAIL in vitro , the viability of B16F0 cells treated with variousconcentrations of either exosomes or Exo-TRAIL (50, 100, 150 and200 µg/mL) for 24 h was evaluated. The MTT assay demonstrated thatthere was a signi ﬁcant di ﬀerence in cell viability between cells treated
with Exo-TRAIL and those treated with exosomes, pvalue = 0.0314(Fig. 3).Fig. 1. Characterization of exosomes secreted by MSC. FESEM image of exosome (A), exosome size (B), ﬂow cytometric analysis of common exosome markers, CD9

3.4. In vitro evaluation of induction of apoptosis in B16F0 cell lineTo investigate the apoptosis induction in B16F0 cells, cells wereco-cultured with Exo-TRAIL. After 24 h, apoptosis was evaluatedusing ﬂow cytometry. Cells treated with Exo-TRAIL indicated sig-niﬁcant cell death compared to non-treated B16F0 cells. Exo-TRAIL andexosome induced 11.93% and 4.69% apoptosis in B16F0 cells, respec-tively ( Fig. 4).3.5. Animal studyTo evaluate the in vivo anti-tumor activity of exosomes using threemodels, melanoma tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice were prepared bysubcutaneous inoculation of 3×105B16F0 cells. In the co-deliverymodel, tumor cells were co-injected with exosomes, while in non-co-delivery model, exosomes, either in a single or multiple doses wereinjected after tumor appearance as described above.In the next stage, body weight, tumor size and survival were mon-itored over time. The tumor volume was calculated by measuring the
tumor in three dimensions. Data including median survival time (MST),time to reach endpoint and the percentage of tumor growth delay andincrease of life span (%ILS) corresponding to the anti-tumor e ﬀect andtherapeutic e ﬃcacy of Exo-TRAIL either in single or multi-dose non-codelivery study in melanoma mouse model was summarized inTable 1. The results of animal weight monitoring as shown in Fig. 8A –Cindicated that the Exo-TRAIL was a tolerable biological nanovesiclewith no body weight loss in all studied animals. H&E staining of asection of tumor tissues was performed then necrotic changes wereevaluated in a blinded manner by optical microscope and histologicalnecrotic percentage was determined ( Fig. 5).Our results showed that co-injection of tumor cells with Exo-TRAILdelayed tumor appearance for six days in comparison with controlgroup. The tumor volume was signi ﬁcantly reduced (Exo-TRAIL vscontrol, pvalue < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA). The percent of necrosis
in both MSC-derived exosome and Exo-TRAIL groups in comparisonwith control group was not signi ﬁcant ( Fig. 6A-B).As it is shown in Fig. 6C and D, non-codelivery with single dose ofExo-TRAIL could delay progression of tumor. However, at the end ofstudy, there was no di ﬀerence in tumor volume between mice treatedwith Exo-TRAIL, MSC-derived exosome and control ( pvalue = 0.4984).The results of the microscopic observation of the percent of necrosisrevealed that the necrosis changes in both MSC-derived exosome andExo-TRAIL groups were not signi ﬁcant in comparison with controlgroup. Multi-dose IV injection of Exo-TRAIL exhibited signi ﬁcant anti-tumor activity in vivo. Tumor size signi ﬁcantly decreased in mice re-ceiving multi-dose injections of either MSC-derived exosome or Exo-TRAIL in comparison with control group ( pvalue = 0.0001). Moreover,signiﬁcant necrotic changes were observed in Exo-TRAIL group com-pared to the control ( pvalue = 0.0336) ( Fig 5 andFig. 6E and F).
The survival experiment represented in a Kaplan –Meier plot wasused to investigate the di ﬀerences in the therapeutic e ﬃcacy of singledose and multi-dose non-codelivery regimens.

either MSC-derived exosome or Exo-TRAIL with single dose had amedian survival time of 25 days compared to 21 days for control group.However, in multi-dose group, mice treated with either MSC-derivedexosome or Exo-TRAIL had a median survival time of 27 and 29 days,respectively while the control group had median survival time of 21days ( Fig. 7A and B). It is therefore clear that multi-dose non-codeliveryregimen is therapeutically superior to their corresponding single doseand showed a signi ﬁcant e ﬀect on animal survival in comparison toMSC-derived exosome multi-dose non-codelivery treatment ( pvalu <0.05; log rank test).As summarized in Table 1, the tumor growth delay (%TGD) in micereceiving a single dose of Exo-TRAIL was 6.69% whereas the %TGD formice treated with multi-dose administration of Exo-TRAIL was 13.29%.Moreover, the %TGD of mice receiving either multi-dose or single doseof MSC-derived exosome was 11.24% and 6.46%, respectively. In-
creased life span (ILS) in mice receiving a single dose of Exo-TRAIL was19% while in those receiving multi-dose of Exo-TRAIL was 38.09%.Moreover, ILS% in mice receiving either single dose or multi-dose ofMSC-derived exosome was 19% and 28.57%, respectively.3.6.

HMPAO-labeled exosomes were administrated into the tail veins ofmice bearing tumor followed by in vivo biodistribution evaluationusing in vivo imaging on Gamma Camera. Animal imaging and bio-distribution results for99mTc-HMPAO-labeled exosomes are presentedinFigure 10. Our ﬁndings by animal imaging at 1 h post-injectionshowed strong radioactive signal in the liver, lung, spleen and tumortissue. After 3 h, the major sites of accumulation were bladder andabdominal cavity. After 6 h, the radioactive signal of abdominal activitywas similar to 3 h.99mTc HMPAO exosomes accumulation was observedat tumor site which was not signi ﬁcant due to its low uptake.The ex vivo biodistribution study and %ID/g, (injected dose pergram organ) of tissues indicated that99mTc-HMPAO -labeled exosomeswere mainly taken up by liver, lung and spleen which are normal sitesfor nanoparticle clearance. The highest %ID/g of tumor tissue was2.78 ± 0.6 which was observed 6 h after99mTc-HMPAO-labeled exo-
some injection ( Fig. 9 and 10).4. DiscussionExosomes derived from MSCs demonstrated promising therapeuticeﬀects and potential for drug delivery and antitumor activity. Thesafety of exosome therapy is con ﬁrmed in some clinical trials ( Chaputet al., 2005,). Some studies showed that MSC-derived exosomes couldinhibit tumor growth in di ﬀerent cancer cell lines including T24(human bladder carcinoma), HepG2 (liver hepatocellular carcinoma),Kaposi's sarcoma and induce necrosis in Skov-3 (ovarian carcinomacells) ( Rani et al., 2015). The mechanism of this anti-proliferative e ﬀectgreatly varied between di ﬀerent cell lines. It could be cell cycle arrest,induction of apoptosis or necrosis. It is con ﬁrmed that the cytotoxicityof MSCs-derived exosomes is due to a down-regulation of Akt phos-phorylation, delivery of pro-apoptotic signal and up-regulation of cas-pase-3 cleavage ( Bruno et al. 2014). Lee et al. suggested that MSC-de-
rived exosomes transferring di ﬀerent molecules including miR-16, amiRNA which targets VEGF, could epigenetically reprogram the tumorcells for down-regulation of VEGF expression and consequently sup-presses the angiogenesis in breast cancer model in vivo andin vitro (Leeet al., 2013 ).However, recent studies indicated that MSC therapy in cancer isvery controversial. Some reports indicated that MSCs could possesssystemic immunosuppressive e ﬀect which could lead to an increase insurvival and proliferation of tumor cells at the mismatch extracellularmatrix ( Djouad et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2008 ). On the other hand, MSCshave a natural a ﬃnity for tumors. Furthermore, genetically-engineeredMSCs could produce and deliver therapeutic molecules (includingtherapeutic cytokines) as well as prolong the survival of tumor-bearinganimals ( Nakamura et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2009 ) Many studies re-
ported the tumor suppressive property of MSCs through several me-chanisms including regulation of cell cycle ( Dasari et al., 2010 ) andinhibition of the Wnt and AKT signaling pathways ( Qiao et al., 2008;Ho et al., 2013 ).TRAIL as a promising agent for cancer therapy, can induce cellapoptosis by interaction with its receptors (DR4 and DR5) on tumorcells but not on normal cells. The expression of TRAIL decoy receptors,low surface death receptors and inhibitory mechanisms downstream ofactivated caspase-3 are some mechanisms that protect normal cellsagainst TRAIL ( Zhang et al., 2000 ). Human melanoma cells constantlyexpress TRAIL receptor R2 (DR5) ( Kurbanov et al., 2005 ). However,mouse has only a pro-apoptotic TRAIL-R which has similar homology toboth human DR4 and DR5 ( Wu et al., 1999). Murine melanoma cells(B16) express moderate level of TRAIL-R on their cell surface ( Dufouret al., 2017 ).TRAIL is an innate immune cytokine which is largely expressed on
innate immune cells. TRAIL-expressing cells including lymphocytes, NKcell (natural killer cells), and neutrophils, play a role in im-
TRAIL is an innate immune cytokine which is largely expressed oninnate immune cells. TRAIL-expressing cells including lymphocytes, NKcell (natural killer cells), and neutrophils, play a role in im-munosurveillance against tumor initiation and metastasis ( Smyth et al.,2003; Guimarães et al., 2018 ). TRAIL is well known as a positive reg-ulator of myeloid di ﬀerentiation because of its ability to increase thenumber and maturation of monocytes and macrophages, lymphocyteproliferation and IFN- γproduction ( Pietro and Zauli, 2004 ). IFN- γis asignature cytokine of Th1 response which is a mechanism responsiblefor tumor clearance in normal physiological immune system. Somecytokines such IFN- γ, IL-2, IFNs, or IL-15 augmented the Th1 responsesand upregulated the TRAIL expression on NK cells, monocytes, mac-rophage and dendritic cells. TRAIL is also involved in the tumoricidalactivity of these stimulated cells ( Hill and Sarvetnick, 2002; Smythet al., 2003 ).
et al., 2003 ).Unexpectedly, formulations containing recombinant TRAIL facedwith some challenges to be considered for use in human including lowcirculation half-life, poor stability after systemic injection, and in-eﬃcient delivery to target sites. ( De Miguel et al., 2016) Currently, toovercome this problem some study used new formulations of TRAIL.Mueller et al. indicated that TRAIL-engineered MSCs could exhibitinhibitory e ﬀect on growth of some TRAIL-resistant CRC cells (HCT8cells) in vitro andin vivo. However, they showed that some tumor cells(HT-29 cells) remained resistant to MSC-TRAIL and growth of tumorcells increased in vivo even after sensitization with 5- ﬂuorouracilTable 1Therapeutic eﬃcacy of MSC-derived exosome and Exo-TRAIL after iv admin-istration with either single or multi-dose non-co-delivery into mice bearingB16F0 tumor.GROUP TTE(day SD) TGD (%) MST (day) ILS (%)Exo-TRAILMulti-dose24.88 ± 3.35 13.29% 29 38.09%Exosome

(Mueller et al., 2011 ). Thus clinical application of MSC-TRAIL shouldbe considered with cautions and further detailed preclinical studies areneeded to con ﬁrm the safety of MSC therapy in cancer.Some studies showed high cancer cell-killing e ﬃciency of TRAIL-expressing exosomes in comparison with the recombinant solubleTRAIL. It was recently shown that the lipid membrane of exosomescontaining TRAIL, because of ﬂuidics nature of bilayer membrane,possibly allows higher order TRAIL oligomerization and subsequentlyhigher clustering of its receptors, which is an essential signal for ef-fective activation of the extrinsic death pathway ( Yuan et al., 2017 ).There are some studies in which TRAIL-coated lipid nanoparticleswhich resemble the natural exosomes, have been used to increase theTRAIL bioactivity in order to more e ﬃciently promote trail receptor
(DR5) clustering on the cell surface and to prompt strong activation ofthe caspase cascade resulting in greater cytotoxicity against cancerouscells related to sTRAIL (soluble TRAIL) in an in vivo model ( De Miguelet al., 2016 ). Some evidences have been reported indicating that re-combinant soluble TRAIL can induce proliferative e ﬀect in neuro-blastoma cells whereas membrane-bound form of TRAIL expressed onNK cells possesses cytolysis e ﬀect on tumor cell types such as neuro-blastoma ( Sheard et al., 2013).On the other hand, it has recently been reported that CD4+ lym-phocytes of patients with advanced melanoma have an impairment toexpress TRAIL on their surfaces ( Smyth et al., 2003 ).Considering the challenges facing the use of recombinant TRAIL, webeneﬁted from the combination use of tumor speci ﬁc-cytotoxicity ofTRAIL and intrinsic properties of MSC-derived exosomes on tumor cellsand investigated the anti-tumor e ﬀect of Exo-TRAIL and not the re-
combinant TRAIL in the current study.We successfully delivered plasmid encoding TRAIL/GFP to MSCswith a novel non-viral vector based on PEI 25 kDa which was developedin our previous study ( Salmasi et al., 2015 ). In the next stage, exosomeswere isolated from the condition media of both native MSC and MSC-TRAIL and characterized. The presence of two main exosomal markers,CD63 and CD9, was con ﬁrmed by ﬂow cytometry. TRAIL protein con-tent and its expression on exosomes were investigated by Western blotandﬂow cytometry, respectively. We detected TRAIL/GFP ﬂuorescentsignal in cells by ﬂuorescent microscopic examination. Moreover, thepresence of TRAIL in Exo-TRAIL was con ﬁrmed by both ﬂow cytometryand Western blot analyses. Band corresponding to TRAIL molecule wasdetected at ∼70 KD which represent a hexameric form of membraneTRAIL. Our results are in agreement with previously published data in

which functional hexameric form of TRAIL was associated with thebioactivity and apoptosis induction of Exo-TRAIL in cancer cells(Stenqvist et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2017 ).Then, uptake of exosomes by B16F0 cells was studied with bothﬂuorescent microscope and ﬂow cytometry. Sixteen hours post in-cubation, MSC-derived exosomes were e ﬃciently taken up by B16F0cells. Flow cytometry results illustrated that 38%of the B16F0 cellswere positive for the DiI-staining exosomes. In addition, MTT assayindicated the cytotoxic e ﬀects of both exosomes and Exo-TRAIL onB16F0 cells. Moreover Exo-TRAIL could e ﬃciently induce apoptosisand cell death in tumor cells. Flow cytometry investigation of AnnexinV+/PI- cells after treatment with Exo-TRAIL and MSC-derived exo-somes represent in vitro apoptosis induction of Exo-TRAIL and MSC-derived exosomes on B16F0 cells. Exo-TRAIL indicated signi ﬁcant cellapoptosis compared to non-treated B16F0 cells.
apoptosis compared to non-treated B16F0 cells.Furthermore, the e ﬀects of both exosomes and Exo-TRAIL on tumorgrowth were studied in vivo . For this purpose, we designed three ex-perimental mouse melanoma models including co-delivery, single dosenon-co-delivery and multi-dose non-co-delivery.In co-delivery model, our ﬁndings demonstrated that co-injection ofExo-TRAIL with tumor cells delayed the tumor appearance for 6 days.Additionally, the tumor volume e ﬃciently decreased in tumor bearingmice. Our study is consistent with previous report in which tumor sizedecreased in comparison with control group in the exosome co-deliverymodel ( Lee et al., 2013 ).In non-codelivery model, single dose treatment of Exo-TRAILshowed anti-tumor activity in early days but at the end of study, itsantitumor activity was approximately the same as the exosome andcontrol groups. However, it was shown that multi-dose injection of Exo-
TRAIL reduced the tumor size signi ﬁcantly compared to the controlgroups. Necrotic changes in three models of subcutaneous melanomawere observed. However, in multi-dose injection group, necrotic areasof Exo-TRAIL group were signi ﬁcantly larger than those of either exo-some or control groups. Moreover, survival data indicated that mediansurvival time of mice receiving Exo-TRAIL was signi ﬁcantly higher thanthose observed with either those receiving exosome or control groups.The life span increased by 8 days in mice receiving multi-dose of Exo-TRAIL versus control group. In one study, Rivoltini et al. evaluatedantitumor activity of K562-derived exosomes in vivo. The results in-dicated that intra-tumor injection of k562– derived Exo –TRAIL trans-fected with lentiviral carrier displayed antitumor e ﬀects in TRAIL-deathreceptor 5 positive cells and also caused massive perivascular necrosis(Rivoltini et al., 2016 ). The in vivo cytotoxicity of the exosome and Exo-
TRAIL treatment was assessed through body weight loss (BWL). Noobvious change in body weight was found in the treatment groups.Previous studies also reported that multiple injection of exosomes iswell tolerated and safe ( Escudier et al., 2005 ).Exo-TRAIL is more e ﬃcient than exosome to inhibit cancer cellsgrowth in multi-dose model. The %TGD of mice treated with either Exo-TRAIL or exosome was 13.29% and 11.24%, respectively. However,enhanced life span in mice receiving multi-dose of either Exo-TRAIL orexosomes was 38.09% and 28.57%, respectively. Our results indicatedthat the multi-dose administration of Exo-TRAIL had an e ﬀective anti-tumor activity with no signi ﬁcantbody weight loss and improved theILS% and TGD compared to other models. Exo-TRAIL high e ﬃciency forcancer cell killing in vitro has been previously reported by Yuan et al.(Yuan et al., 2017 ).Therefore, the exosomal delivery of TRAIL (Exo-TRAIL) is appro-
priate for the TRAIL oligomerization, thereby maintaining its bioac-tivity by protecting it from cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases(MMP), leading to the recruitment of other members of extrinsic death
(MMP), leading to the recruitment of other members of extrinsic deathpathway to trigger apoptosis in target cells ( Stenqvist et al., 2013; Yuanet al., 2017 ). On the other hand, the engineered Exo-TRAIL, as a naturalnano-carrier for TRAIL has the potential to increase the anti-tumor ef-fect by boosting the immune system and thus inducing apoptosis intumor cells.After systemic administration, exosomes may potentially enter widerange of tissues. We analyzed the biodistribution and in vivo behavior ofexosomes after systemic injection of99mTc-HMPAO-labeled exosomessimilar to what was done with un-labeled exosomes. The results re-vealed that accumulation of exosomes in the liver, lung and spleen wasprominent. Also, the uptake of99mTc -HMPAO-labeled exosomes bytumor tissue was con ﬁrmed. In most cases, similar to our ﬁnding, it hasbeen shown that exploitation of exosome as drug delivery vehicle hasled to improved stability and blood circulation time of drug and other
small molecules, thus improving their potency by lowering the IC 50(Luan et al., 2017 ). However, in order to improve the low tumor uptakeof exosomes, other strategies should be considered. Targeting ligandssuch as aptamer or peptide for receptor-dependent ligands interactioncould be used to increase the uptake and accumulation of exosomes atthe tumor site. Moreover, the most commonly used techniques forbiodistribution study and in vivo exosomes tracking face drawbacksspecially at low exosome concentrations. Considering these drawbacks,the uptake level of exosomes at the tumor site might be underestimated(Gangadaran et al., 2017 ).There was also some uptake by the kidneys and intestine which wasattributed to free99mTc-HMPAO in labeled exosomes. This suggestedthat Sephadex G-50 should be used to remove the free99mTc-HMPAO.Fig. 10. In vivo biodistribution of99mTc HMPAO exosomes, anterior position 1

As previously described, exosomes labeled with XenoLight DiR werecapable of targeting and homing in tumors when systemically ad-ministered ( Ohno et al., 2013 ).5. ConclusionIn summary, the data presented in our study demonstrated that Exo-TRAIL inhibited tumor progression by massive necrosis in cancer cellsafter multi-dose administration. It can also delay tumor appearance forseveral days after co-implanted with tumor cells. Based on these results,it could be concluded that the Exo-TRAIL antitumor activity was dosedependent. Finally, the results demonstrated homing ability for exo-some and signi ﬁcant tumor growth inhibition in both in vitro andin vivomodels.To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report showing that IVadministration of Exo-TRAIL which was obtained from non-viral en-gineered-MSC-TRAIL could be considered as a promising cell freestrategy in cancer therapy. Also, we suggest that combination of Exo-
TRAIL and chemotherapeutics, small molecules or natural compoundscan be investigated in future studies as a promising anti-tumor strategy.Furthermore, TRAIL-engineered exosomes could be exploited for drugdelivery purposes to deliver therapeutic agents providing a robustcombination therapy platform.AcknowledgmentsThis work was funded by the Mashhad University of MedicalSciences, Mashhad (MUMS), Iran.

These vesicles contain membrane and cytoplasmiccomponents of producing cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the ideal producer of exosomes. The secretedvesicles from MSCs are promising biological vehicles for cell-free therapy in regenerative medicine, cancer
therapy and targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to the tumor cells. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising member of the TNF family with selective effect on cancerous cells. Recentevidences showed that the membrane TRAIL-armed exosomes possess anti-tumor activity. However, the effect ofinvivo administration of TRAIL-armed exosomes has not been reported so far. In the current study, mesenchymalstem cells expressing TRAIL/GFP proteins were prepared with the help of a non-viral vector based on poly-ethylenimine 25 kDa. Then, exosomes containing TRAIL protein (Exo-TRAIL) were isolated from the supernatantof genetically engineered MSCs and characterized. Antitumor activity of both MSC-derived exosomes and Exo-TRAIL was investigated in vitro andin vivo in three models. The results indicated that the co-injection of bothExo-TRAIL and tumor cells delayed the tumor appearance. Besides, the tumor volume/weight was efficiently
decreased in tumor bearing mice. Moreover, it was shown that multi-dose injections of Exo-TRAIL reduced thetumor size while single dose treatment with Exo-TRAIL did not show significant anti-tumor activity. To con-clude, these results suggested that MSC-derived Exo-TRAIL has a potential capacity for cancer treatment.The authors regret to inform that the Abstract section of the pub-lished article was left out.The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2019.02.003DOI of original article: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2018.07.067E-mailaddresses: Ramezanim@mums.ac.ir (M.
